			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>This is a simple issue.</p>
<p>It used to be that you couldn&#8217;t short a stock unless there was an uptick. The idea was that this uptick rule would prevent short sellers from piling on a stock and driving the price down.  Then the uptick rule was removed.  It became permissable to borrow shares of stock and sell them whether or not the stock had ticked up or not. The result ? Nothing. Not a darn thing changed.</p>
<p>Good companies operated their companies well. They recognized that short sellers just created future demand for their stocks. If they pushed the price down to new lows, it just created an opportunity for investors to buy the company at cheaper prices.  So be it.  Good companies aren&#8217;t defined by their stock prices, they are defined by their operations.</p>
<p>On the flipside are poorly managed companies. Poorly managed companies always presume the current business environment will stay the way it is.  The big investment banks  thought they could always raise capital and deploy it at higher returns. Which is a great model to lever up to squeeze every possible  nickel out. It makes it easier to get your bonus and makes shareholders who only pay attention to the stock price happy.</p>
<p>Except that leverage is risk. Always has been, always will be.  When you dont manage your risk well, you pay the consequences.</p>
<p>The problem with the likes of Lehmans, Bear Stearns et al, wasn&#8217;t that their stock prices were pushed down, it was that they had become myopic and overly leveraged.  They had not considered all possible negative  scenarios.   When they were forced to write down assets and couldnt get access to loans because no one trusted their balance sheets,  they were without capital. When they were without capital, they were SOL. Deleveraging brought their entire business models  crashing down along with their stock prices.  Lehman disappeared, the rest got government bailouts or were pushed to be bought out.</p>
<p>If they had not over leveraged, the price of their stock would not have mattered. If they had managed their risks properly, their stock price would not have mattered.  The uptick rule had nothing to do with their failures.  Management did. To blame it on the uptick rule is ridiculous. Companies that hadn&#8217;t overlevered and stuck by their lending and business principles got along just fine.  Their stock prices did just fine as well.  It really as simple as that.</p>
<p>Does anyone really think that even if there was an uptick rule and stock prices were not as volatile and even possibly higher, that anyone would have given Lehman&#8217;s capital in a private raise with all the uncertainty about their balance sheet ?</p>
<p>Put another way, if the uptick rule drove down prices, it should have been EASIER for the financial companies to raise money. Smart investors would have recognized the strength of their balance sheets and gladly jumped at the chance to invest money at prices depressed by those nasty short sellers capitalizing on the lack of an uptick rule.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what happened.  What happened is exactly what should have happened. Good companies did well. Poorly run companies didn&#8217;t. Those in the middle got lucky and bailed out. The uptick had zero impact.</p>
<p>Thats not to say short sellers didn&#8217;t pick on the financial companies. Of course they did. They did so because they were poorly managed. They were right</p>
<p>When you hear someone talk about bringing back the uptick rule as a solution. Laugh. Then tell them &#8220;Larry Bird is not waking through that door&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Youtube has been messing with the magic quite a bit lately.  Wide screen, high quality and the drive me crazy pre rolls to subscribe among many others. (BTW, watching the subscribe button scurrying around the screen was fun the first 300 times).  But lets talk Youtube business. Thats the source of their desperation.</p>
<p>From all appearances, Youtube is trying to squeeze every last nickel they can out of Youtube.  Overlay ads. Adding licensed content from major media companies. Segregating professional content like movies and TV shows. They are doing everything they can think of to create advertising inventory.  Pre rolls, overlays, display ads, you name it. And thats before you get to the inventory the creators of the videos insert and overlay in the content itself.  Does anyone else out there think that the  advertising in youtube videos is more intrusive than any other form of content ?</p>
<p>Without writing a dissertation on the subject, what are the quick and dirty conclusions that we can draw from all of this ? Why all the desperate maneuvers ?</p>
<p>I see two plausible options:</p>
<p>1. Youtube&#8217;s video delivery  costs are far, far higher than the estimates we give them credit for. Youtube says they have 13gbs of user uploaded content EVERY SECOND.  At 12 cents per gbs, thats about 50mm dollars per year in upload costs. If over the coarse of a year, each of that video is watched only 10 times, thats another $500mm in bandwidth costs.  If videos are watched more than 10 times, the number grows exponentially.  Thats a lot of money, but if that number happens to be low, its easy to see why Youtube would be desperate in this economic climate.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. Youtube is truly scared they are going to lose, or may feel they have already lost the Viacom case.  They could fear  a judgment that requires them to breakup Youtube into 2 websites. One only with content for which they have licenses and the other for purely user generated content on which they have zero advertising.  That doesn&#8217;t really sound like Google, but their actions do suggest they may fear they will have to negotiate a settlement with Viacom and the other plaintiffs.</p>
<p>In a recent NYTimes article they admitted to having lots of bodies doing nothing but reviewing for porn. Recently they said they are going to set higher standards for sexuality and profanity.  If you can review for levels of porn, sex and profanity, you can review for copyright violations.</p>
<p><strong>Youtube seems to be acting as if they have already lost the suit. Rather than integrating licensed content into the &#8220;community&#8221; of user generated content, they are doing everything they can to segregate it. That is consistent with what I would guess Viacom would ask for in a settlement</strong>.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m Viacom, I ask not only for a big chunk of cash, but also for them to stop violating the DMCA .  The solution is for them  to set up 2 seperate websites. One for content for which they have licenses and on which they can sell advertising, and the other on which they have user uploaded content and on which they can not sell any advertising. That would put them completely in compliance with the DMCA and make content owners happy.</p>
<p>The good news for Youtube is that other than the check they will write,  they are well on their way to solving this problem.<strong> A look at the current Youtube home page demonstrates the new reality of user generated content. Everyone wants to get paid</strong>. <strong> Rare is the widely viewed video that doesn&#8217;t have a profit or stardom motivation.</strong> For everyone else, they don&#8217;t really care where their videos are hosted. They use Youtube  to take advantage of the free hosting costs and will be viewed by friends and family.</p>
<p>Where does that leave Youtube ? Actually in a far better place. Two websites. One of which becomes a video search engine , with out any advertising, that hosts purely amateur video. The other becomes a Hulu on steroids. A destination site that becomes a real media site. It becomes the ultimate content DVR where users can expect to find professionally created content along side the amateur videos that Youtube thought enough of to license.</p>
<p>This segregation would also mean that Youtube could leverage all the monetization skills of Google and probably REDUCE the number and types of ads that have infested the current Youtube.  The new site could be designed to maximize user satisfaction and revenue rather than skirt the language of copyright laws.</p>
<p>There is no question that Youtube is taking monetization to an extreme. Its either because their costs are more than anyone has estimated or because they are trying to squeeze every last dollar out of the current Youtube configuration before a big change</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>First let me say that this has nothing to do with me, but given my interest in all things financial and the government during this financial crisis, I read with interest the Office of Inspector General&#8217;s Report to Congress regarding the SEC. The SEC deserves credit for casting such a critical eye at itself. It should happen more often in government.</p>
<p>First the humorous side of the report, the SEC apparently has issues with Porn usage among employees.</p>
<p>Now the Serious.</p>
<p>It never crossed my mind that it would be legal for employees of the SEC to trade stocks. Not that they shouldn&#8217;t have rights to own whatever they want in a trust. They should. Trading individual stocks and bonds. Wow.</p>
<p>There is a SEC policy in place regarding trading and what employees can and can&#8217;t do according to this report, but if you know about actions of one company, even if you don&#8217;t trade that company, doesn&#8217;t that provide you insight into an entire industry ?</p>
<p>But wait there is more. According to this report,</p>
<p>&#8221; we have determined that the Commission’s current system in place to report the ownership and<br />
trading of securitie<strong>s is insufﬁcient to prevent and detect insider trading on the part of<br />
Commission employees </strong>or violations of the Commission’s rules.</p>
<p>The OIG investigation has found that the reports that employees are required to ﬁle when they buy, sell or own securities are not meaningfully reviewed or sufﬁciently checked for conﬂicts of interest.  Moreover, there is currently no system in place for the Commission to detect if an employee who has traded or owns a security failed to properly report such transaction.  &#8220;</p>
<p>Double wow.</p>
<p>And then there is this:<br />
Allegation of Retaliatory Investigation<br />
The OIG is investigating an allegation that Commission staff <strong>engaged in a retaliatory investigation of a company after it publicly complained about naked short selling</strong>.  During this reporting period, the OIG took extensive sworn, on-the-record testimony of the complainant and reviewed certain relevant documents.  The OIG plans to interview additional witnesses identiﬁed by the complainant and to take the sworn, on-the- record testimony of the Commission attorneys who worked on the matter.</p>
<p>If you want more information about Naked Shorting, <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2005/03/02/naked-shorts-what-i-have-learned/" target="_blank">this is one of my posts on the subject</a></p>
<p>The OIG report makes for interesting reading with ALLEGATIONS of intimidation, perjury, falsifying data to a court to get a judgment, and lots of abusive behavior within the employee ranks.  Then there is the irony of their lack of a definitive policy on the distribution of material non public information.</p>
<p>Finally, there is this nugget from the study:</p>
<p><strong>Referrals to Department of Justice for Prosecution 6. Thats 6 SEC employees being referred to the Department of Justice for consideration of criminal prosecution. For the 6 months between April 1 and Sep 30 of this year. Out of only 3500 employees. </strong></p>
<p>No wonder they released it on the Friday after Thanksgiving without any press release to let people know its available&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>In the big picture this is not a major suggestion. Think of it as something that can be done with no downside and long term benefit.</p>
<p>I personally don&#8217;t think a stimulus package of checks or rebates to the consumer will work. I believe consumers are so beaten up and fearful of the future that they will put it in the bank.  Of course 20 years ago that would have been a good thing, These days banks don&#8217;t appear to be lending those deposits. So there is no primary or secondary stimulus impact.</p>
<p>Instead, having the government spend money on public works, which in turn creates jobs, will have a quick and positive economic impact. As much as it pains me to write those words, a drowning economy can&#8217;t worry about its form as it tries to get back to the surface. Sometimes you have to win ugly.</p>
<p>Private money is going to stay on the sidelines because we all know that there are unbelievable bargains available out there. Our money is waiting  to go to equity and debt where we think we will get outsized returns. If and when those returns happen, money will come back in as new capital investment. Until then, the only liquid investor willing to put non current assets on their balance sheet is the government.</p>
<p>My little idea on where the government should spend money in public works projects ?</p>
<p>Parks and Schools.</p>
<p>Maybe this is obvious to those in the coming administration, but I think we should be buying up foreclosed homes in areas that have been overwhelmed with them . Tearing them down, and replacing them with parks and schools.</p>
<p>Of course municipalities will have to get involved with eminent domain, but a guess is that if we buy occupied homes in communities with a large base of foreclosures, we would be rescuing many homeowners from huge declines in the market values of their homes. Something many will not be upset with.</p>
<p>The upside of this program of course is that not only will you be improving areas that have come across tough times with parks and schools that will act as attractions to potential new residents, but the inventory of homes will be reduced as well.</p>
<p>Two years ago creating parks and building schools was a local endeavor that few municipalities could afford. Today they are an investment that can bring suffering communities emotional and financial relief</p>
<p>On to the subject of the Inauguration. Four years ago I<a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2004/12/31/do-the-right-thing-cancel-inauguration-parties/"> suggested that the Bush administration cancel the inauguration parties </a>and instead ask corporations to donate that money to the victims of the Tsunami.</p>
<p>Its fair to ask where I stand on the coming inauguration and whether parties should be canceled and money sent to the victims of the tragedy in India.</p>
<p>When the tsunami hit, it was a devastaion of epic proportions. Raising money for the survivors and rebuilding was a responsibility we as a nation accepted. We had telethons, events and fund raisers to try to help. The unfortunate situation in India, at least as it stands today, is not one that can be helped by contributions to the survivors. Thoughts and prayers, yes. Potentially  support for anti terrorism programs, yes. But re-routing funds from anything to India, as least as far as I am aware, won&#8217;t help survivors or hostages at this time.</p>
<p>In addition, the 2005 inauguration was President Bush&#8217;s 2nd term. That it and of itself makes it a completely different set of circumstances.</p>
<p>That said, the coming inauguration is not off the hook. Some of the costs for housing, events and tickets I have seen and been offered are absurd. President Elect Obama should recognize and address the fact that in these economic times, corporations that are laying off people or getting bailout money should not be spending money sponsoring inaugural events.</p>
<p>Is there any doubt that the next &#8220;bailout scandal&#8221; will be banks and other bailout recipients sponsoring Inauguration events or spending boatloads of money to attend ?</p>
<p>Note to PE Obama, have your staff scrub the sponsors list and look for the words &#8220;bank&#8221;, GM, Ford and Chrysler and then google all sponsors for the word &#8220;layoff&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Just a brief update to try to explain what some commenters dont seem to understand.</p>
<p>1. the only thing that cable companies, and satellite for that matter have to sell is bandwidth and the applications they can run on that bandwith. More bandwidth means more digital everything.</p>
<p>2. For Basic Cable subscribers that get say, 40 analog channels, they are consuming 40 x 38.6mbs or 1.54 Gbs. Let that sink in. 1.54 Gbs of bandwidth. Compare that to how fast your internet access is. That more bandwidth than your entire neighborhood consumes online , by a lot.</p>
<p>Thats also the equivalent of 500 standard def digital channels.  If you convert that to revenue per bit for cable companies, or cost per bit for basic cable consumers,  the basic cable customers are getting the best deal in town. By a long shot.</p>
<p>Digital cable customers, not so much. Digital customers are paying multiples of analog customers for bandwidth.</p>
<p>In reality, analog customers are getting an amazing deal, and the cable companies have been hesitant to convert them only because of the potential FCC backlash.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m as cynical as the next guy when it comes to cable rates and motivations, but the reality is that the longer analog remains, the fewer opportunities to leverage the freed up bandwidth to create next generation bandwidth hog applications.</p>
<p>Will the cable companies charge us an a lot for that bandwidth, probably. But when we start to see applications built on top of 250mbs per second and more, it will have far more value to society than watching USA Network on your old analog TV</p>
<p>And Net Neutrality ? Well if everyone had that 1.54gbs available to them, net neutrality would be a non issue. We wouldnt be arguing about access or pre emption, we would be arguing about quality of service</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>You may not know it, but the cable industry is fighting a battle for the future of the internet. In the grand scheme of things, I think both the FCC and the Cable and Satellite industries want to see the internet thrive. In this case I believe the FCC is making a mistake.</p>
<p>Every now and then, things get a little confused and in this case the confusion is going to cause the internet to take a hit. It could be a potentially big hit, and the only group fighting it is the cable industry, and yours truly.</p>
<p>The Cable industry has been doing exactly what every internet user in search of more bandwidth wants them to do, converting analog versions of channels to digital.  Each analog channel takes up 38mbs of bandwidth. Thats right.  CSPAN takes up more bandwidth than you have available to you for internet services. Crazy isnt it ?</p>
<p>The standard def digital version of the same channel takes up less than 3mbs. The typical HD version takes up about 8mbs or less. So, every time a channel is converted from analog to digital a MINIMUM of 28mbs is freed up.</p>
<p>Of course the bandwidth that is freed up can be used for any number of digital offerings, from more internet bandwidth (accomplished via channel bonding and Docsis 3.0), to more HD channels (which obviously is good for our <a href="http://www.hd.net" target="_blank">HDNet</a>), more video on demand and more.</p>
<p>Why has the FCC made this an issue ? Because it does reduce the number of channels available to those who connect their cable to older set top boxes or directly to their analog TVs.</p>
<p>So which is more important, protecting analog TV connectivity, or having more bandwidth available ? Obviously I think freeing up bandwidth should be a priority. Otherwise, what is next , stopping Youtube and other video sites from increasing the bit rate of videos because those with dialup will be forced to upgrade ?</p>
<p>Broadband should be a priority in this country. It not only equates to faster internet service, but it will open up many new applications that can significantly impact our society. All of which are far more important than making sure that an old analog TV can receive a few more basic cable tv channels.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>This past Nov 22nd Youtube had its first <a href="http://www.youtube.com/live" target="_blank">major live event</a>. A concert featuring HDNet fave Joe Satriani , Katy Perry Will.I.Am and others.   Of course everyone involved in the space is chattering about whether or not the show was a success.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.mogulus.com" target="_blank">Mogulus</a>, the live internet broadcast peaked at about 700k simultaneous users. That&#8217;s huge for an internet audience.   I think by any traditional Youtube measure , you have to call it a success, with some major gotchas.</p>
<p>First the reasons why it was a success:</p>
<p>700k would be a great audience for a small cable network. Especially for a 1 off show.</p>
<p>MORE IMPORTANT than the audience size was the amount of money that Youtube had to spend to generate that audience. My guess is that they only promoted it on their site  and via traditional PR.</p>
<p>A traditional small cable network would have had to spend several million dollars in off network promotions (radio, tv , net, mag, newspaper) in order to generate that size audience and then they would crow about how it was one of its biggest audiences ever.If Youtube can prove that it can generate this size audience on a weekly or monthly basis, it has a huge hit machine on its hands.</p>
<p>In particular, the audience was probably right in the 18 to 34 sweet spot that advertisers covet. More good news. They will be able to sell a ton of ads in and around their shows.</p>
<p>Thats on the positive side. What about the negative ?</p>
<p>While the cost to promote was extraordinarily low, the cost to deliver was incredibly high. The marginal cost to deliver one more viewer for even the smallest cable network is the same as the largest. Nothing. Youtube had to use the services of Akamai to deliver the event. Akamai by all accounts did a great job, but as the size of the audience grows, the total cost to deliver future Youtube live shows will increase. Cable networks do not have this problem.</p>
<p>Some estimates had the cost to Youtube at 25k or 10c Gb. 10c a gig works for ad hoc downloading, but when you have to have dedicated servers pushing out unicast streams, those costs go up. But even if its only 50k per hour. Extend that out for an entire day, and you are talking $1.2mm PER DAY to deliver an 800k continuous stream to only 700k average simultaneous users Slice and dice the online delivery costs any way you like. Its still incredibly expensive</p>
<p>Thats not going to cut it for any internet content source, even one owned by Google,  to be able to compete with even the smallest cable network.</p>
<p>The 2nd issue applies to the net as a whole. Akamai could devote its full resources to nicely deliver the show to 700k users. The real question is how many of these types of events could they deliver at once ? What if myspace or MTV came to them and there were 3 or more of these at the same time ? How many simultaneous users across multiple large events could Akamai and its competitors handle ?  I would be shocked if it could handle 3mm simultaneous 800k streams reliably.</p>
<p>There were reports of buffering and drop outs for the Youtube Live event. Thats acceptable today. It wont be acceptable as a TV alternative. It will be less acceptable if these live events are offered as alternatives to traditional TV</p>
<p>So there was good news and bad news. Anytime you attract and deliver 700k simultaneous users, its a success. Whether or not a content provider, even Youtube could ever make a profit doing anything more than 1 off events has yet to be determined</p>

<p>On behalf of</p>
<p>Mark Cuban</p>
<p>RE: SEC Civil Action in the United States District</p>
<p>for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division</p>
<p>The SEC knows their case centers on one telephone conversation between two individuals- 4 years ago. The SEC claims there was an agreement between these parties to the conversation to keep certain information confidential. We interviewed Guy Faure, the former CEO of Mamma.com Inc., with whom the SEC claims Mr. Cuban made an agreement. We had a court reporter transcribe the interview. There was no agreement to keep information confidential. Here is a relevant excerpt from the interview with Mr. Faure:</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CLARK :</p>
<p>1) Q- We spoke earlier about you were telling Mr. Cuban in words or substance : &#8220;I have confidential information for you&#8221;.</p>
<p>A- Right.</p>
<p>2) Q- Do you recall anything Mr. Cuban said in response or reply to that statement by you ?</p>
<p>A- No, I do not.</p>
<p>The SEC knows this-they have the transcript, yet they brought the case anyway. Why? Do they have a different statement from Mr. Faure ?</p>
<p>Why did the SEC end their multi-year investigation of Mamma.com Inc. for alleged securities laws violations days before interviewing present and former Mamma.com Inc. executives about this matter? Was the timing a coincidence? We think not.</p>
<p>Any inquiries respecting this release should be directed to Stephen Best at Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP (202) 346-8735.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I wish I could say more, but I will have to leave it to this, and let the judicial process do its job.<br />
November 17, 2008<br />
RE: SEC Civil Action in the United States District</p>
<p>for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division</p>
<p>Mark Cuban today responded to a civil complaint filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States District for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. In its complaint, the Commission charges that Mr. Cuban engaged in violations of the federal securities laws in connection with transactions in the securities of Mamma.com Inc.</p>
<p>This matter, which has been pending before the Commission for nearly two years, has no merit and is a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion. Mr. Cuban intends to contest the allegations and to demonstrate that the Commission’s claims are infected by the misconduct of the staff of its Enforcement Division.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban stated, “I am disappointed that the Commission chose to bring this case based upon its Enforcement staff’s win-at-any-cost ambitions. The staff’s process was result-oriented, facts be damned. The government’s claims are false and they will be proven to be so.”<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>In reading all the discussion about the possibility of a bailout of GM, Ford and maybe Chrysler, it appears to me that no one has asked and answered the fundamental questions behind the issue.</p>
<p>First let me say that this is not about the quality of cars they build. I just bought a Ford for my dad. Im looking at trading in at least my personal Lexus coupe for another Ford I like. I think Ford makes great cars. There are some great GM cars as well. Unfortunately, while the companies make cars I like, they can&#8217;t seem to run their businesses in a way that will allow them to survive.  The issue is not about car quality. Even consumer reports says that the Big 3 now makes reliable cars.  This is about their business model.</p>
<p>The reality of markets is this, If GM, Ford and Chrysler disappeared that doesn&#8217;t mean the demand for cars will disappear. We will still buy cars. The question is what brand we will buy, where will those cars be built,  by what company and how many jobs will be created to fulfill the demand ?   According to Cars.com the <a href="http://www.cars.com/go/advice/Story.jsp?section=top&amp;subject=ami&amp;story=amMade0707" target="_blank">Toyota Camry is built in Lafeyette Indiana </a>and has more than 75pct American Components. <a href="http://www.cars.com/go/advice/Story.jsp?section=top&amp;story=amMadeParts&amp;subject=ami&amp;referer=&amp;aff=national" target="_blank">The Honda Civic is built in the US with more than 70pct of US made components</a>. The Big 3 are not the only manufacturers making cars in the US. If they go away, buy American Made could still survive.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have GM, Ford and Chrysler survive in some new profitable form, but we shouldn&#8217;t lie to ourselves and make it sound like the demand for GM, Ford and Chrysler cars couldn&#8217;t move to other cards made in the USA. Its a lie to suggest that 100pct of the jobs at these companies and their vendors will disappear.  Jobs will be created in the businesses of those car companies that fulfill the demand for cars that the Big 3 leave behind.  That said, it would be nice to find a solution that maintains as much of these institutions as possible and keeps their employees in their jobs if at all possible.</p>
<p>My Solutions ?</p>
<p>Take a page from the FDIC. The government should be in discussions with foreign automakers that have US manufacturing operations to discuss buying/assuming the operations of GM, Ford and/or Chrysler and rolling the acquisitions into Toyota, Honda, whoever with a requirement that the cars continue to be built in the US and any profits remain in the US.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that there are not any well run or even profitable car manufacturers in the US that could assume the operations, but it is what it is.  It will take the US operations of foreign car companies taking  over manufacturing facitilities, dealership relationships, vendor contracts, the whole works. I realize that this is more difficult than assuming bank branches. That manufacturing facilities are different between operators. I didn&#8217;t say this would be easy. It wouldn&#8217;t be. But its far better than the alternative. I would rather see money used to retool manufacturing than fund a business operation that just doesn&#8217;t work and hasnt worked for years.</p>
<p>Of course every induced merger requires concessions. The concessions being that some negotiated percentage of  GM/Ford/Chrysler employees would roll into the cost, pay and benefits structure of the acquirer. The taxpayers would guarantee the BANK debt acquired by whoever takes over the companies. Bond debt would be paid if after everyone else that is owed money, including the government.</p>
<p>Sure, the CEO and management of GM would be upset.  Just as Im sure the CEO and management of banks that were taken over were. Thats life in the big city.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m providing loan guarantees, or direct government loans to car companies to protect jobs,  I would much rather have Toyota US Operations running GM with a Toyota USA cost and manufacturing model than GM, with a GM cost and manufacturing model running GM.  They can apply business principles that actually do work and save whatever part of the Big 3 can be saved.   IMHO, this will keep the largest chunk possible of the  job base in the US and turn the auto industry into income tax payers rather than a taxpayer money pit. Call me crazy. Its time for the US auto industry to go down in history as an example of how not to run a business.  If we want manufacturing to be a priority in this country, we have to find business models that work. We cant just depend on protectionist policies to keep unproductive, unprofitable businesses alive because we think they are too big to fail.</p>
<p>And if there is no Sheila Blair with a plan for the auto industry.  Let em go bankrupt with the government providing financing to help them come out with a brand new business structure. Of course there should be some caveats:</p>
<p><strong>1.. The bankruptcy court puts the designs of all parts, patents and technology of all big 3 cars into the public domain so no one ever has to worry about getting their car fixed. Someone will always be able to build parts or systems for all makes and models.   In fact, making the designs open source could possibly lead to better parts, car designs and repair solutions.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.  The bankruptcy court assigns to their boards someone who has a clue about how to cut costs and manufacture in a cut throat environment. Michael Dell and Andy Grove come to mind. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3.  The court creates a warranty fund, much like the FDIC, where every car sold has some dollar amount go into the fund to pay for warranty service for a maximum of up to 3 years. In the event the Big 3 cant survive out of bankruptcy, repairs on the cars for models sold while the companies are in bankruptcy become a tax credit, with the treasury being reimbursed for these repairs from the fund. (btw, I hate to do something using tax credits, so if anyone else has a better suggestion on how to deal with and pay for warranties..)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably missing something, but if the fear of bankruptcy is buyers will turn away for fear of parts and warranties concerns, problem solved.  In fact, knowing that the government will now help protect warranties could help sales.</p>
<p>Bottom line is this: When doing things the same was as its always been done doesnt work&#8230;.. stop doing it that way. That applies not only to businesses, but consumers as well.</p>
<p>My last car purchase, for my dad,  was American. The next car I buy will be made in America.   I can think of so many reasons why its the right thing to do.  I&#8217;m going to give Detroit another chance and buy American. It wont matter if they are owned by Toyota or Honda, in or out of bankruptcy or as is.  What will matter is whether or not I like the car.  I&#8217;m coming back with an open mind. The product better be as good as advertised or you have lost me forever.</p>
