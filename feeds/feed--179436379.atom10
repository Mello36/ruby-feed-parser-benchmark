			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I have been gone, better yet have been growing.  This week has been a week of reflection for me.  I know I have a lot to say and sometimes when I talk it is also a personal acknowledgment to myself.  Bring upon controversy so I have to grow.</p>
<p>So that is what has happened.  I needed time to think, time to plan, time to reflect.</p>
<p>So I picked up my old journal.  I bought it in 1998 when on a senior field trip with my best friends &#8212; mind you I was not a senior at the time.  A little journal with a leopard design.  That book has held the secrets of my past for 10 years.  I pulled it out to write the blog about my grandmother&#8217;s death.  Tonight I read it cover to cover.  Then I added a few new additions that were way past due.</p>
<p>Dated 6-1-99 (notice a little less than 6 months after i was raped)</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m reading a book called telling a memoir of rape and recovery.  It says to say a man raped me instead of I was raped.  It&#8217;s true how the emotions of it can&#8217;t exactly be explained, the sleepless nights, fear of every shadow not to mention the dreadful aids tests.  This has been a very difficult year first my grandmother&#8217;s death then &#8216;the rape.&#8217;  I did an article for Irvine World News, it was such a great feeling.  I am having a hard time sleeping lately so I bought another angel book.  This one is really good it also talks about spirit guides.  I haven&#8217;t gotten there yet oh well.  My mom doesn&#8217;t understand my fears about it, and I can&#8217;t seem to explain it to her effectively this will be a long process of healing but <strong>I will</strong> get better it will just take a while.</p>
<p>Love, Me&#8221;</p>
<p>When I read this I had to add a new entry &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you did! 12/4/08&#8243;</p>
<p>Not sure my bottom line here.  I had to grow, I had to learn.  Writing comes natural and yet it must be organic for me.  It is 3 in the morning and I felt compelled, so I sit here to write.  </p>
<p>I guess it is all about sharing.  What I wrote 10 years ago I never thought I would share.  I write what I feel and think in hope that it causes another to think.  Another to question, and another to challenge.  Everything that we are, believe and think is a result of our socialization.  I constantly challenge you so that I may challenge myself.  As human beings it is our right to question and our obligation.  Why be given free will, to only succumb to everything that has already been previously indoctrinated into us?  </p>
<p>Go take a look at yourself 10 years ago and ask why you have grown.  I had to.  Last week I spent alone in my house &#8212; that was inconceivable 10 years ago.  Life happens it is all about how we perceive it.  This is not new, it has been delivered from many messengers so when will you choose to hear it.  </p>
<p>Journal entry 12/5/08</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 27 and have had so many lovers and less loves.  I learn, I grow.  I forgot to write for a long time, and yet it was all I ever used to do.  It was  1998 when I bought this book.  I was 16.  Almost 10 years &#8212; wait 10+ years ago &#8212; my I have grown.  Sometimes I still act like the lost child.  I&#8217;m not lost I&#8217;ve always known where I was headed.  Don&#8217;t you wish we could go back and tell our past selves it would be ok?  Well it is and better.  I still push I am still challenged &#8212; but it is all ok.  I am alive AND I have made a difference &#8212; I have started building a legacy.  Reading through this I relive my life.  I feel like I am reading the go ask alice book.  I have lived I have loved I have learned, its not about the past its about the future.  Dear children NEVER judge yourselves live, love, grow that is all there ever will be xoxo Chimine</p>
<p>P.S. I was referring to my future children</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>Chimine</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Many recall the tragedies of April 1994.  The Rwanda genocide was one of the most devastating and publicized genocide of the twentieth century.  Almost a half of million people were brutally murdered, the majority Tutsi and the perpetrators were Hutu.  What most people don&#8217;t know is that 20 years prior in 1972 the Tutsi stood on the other side.  They were the perpetrators of a mass ethnic cleansing against the Hutu in the neighboring country Burundi.  It is estimated that somewhere between 200,000 to 300,000 Hutu lost their lives.</p>
<p>There is no real evidence suggesting a true ethnic difference between the two tribes.  Culture, custom and even language was the same.  It was Belgium however during colonialism that identified them into two tribes based upon economic status.  Identity cards were enforced making a person a Hutu or a Tutsi.  Almost as ridiculous as the practice of measuring a person&#8217;s nose during the holocaust, the Belgian&#8217;s decided who was who.  </p>
<p>In October alone there were 206 reported cases of gang related felonies in San Francisco.  When I asked for information regarding gang related shootings or homicides they 1) didn&#8217;t have the information or 2) didn&#8217;t want to give me the information.  I am guessing the numbers are just as disturbing as 206 cases.  Over the years working with youth at-risk I have heard of one shooting after another.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s insane about both of these cases is that revenge and anger of past violence drives all of the above results.  The average person looks at gang violence and says you need to forgive &#8212; move forward, to end the cycle of violence.  Less people look at the genocide in Rwanda or Burundi and say the same thing.  Even fewer people look at rape or sexual assault and say forgive.</p>
<p>How are any of these cases different and how is one more severe then the other?  They all involve pain, suffering, guilt, revenge and deep-seated anger.  If anything I am going to be controversial and say that rape is less severe.  We didn&#8217;t die, we survived the act.  Hell I would have much rather gone through my 30 minutes than barely surviving a brutal genocide.  </p>
<p>We all fall victim to this thought process at different times in our lives.  I am guilty of not being so nice to different men in my life because I perceived them to be just like my rapist &#8212; they would hurt me and then leave.</p>
<p>Anyways I have gone off on a tangent.  The point is everything we see around us that we identify as violence comes from some other perception of violence &#8212; it is ALL a cycle.  We look at Rwanda and say how sad for the Tutsi and we ignore the fact that they were the perpetrators of the same crime 20 years prior.  We look at gang violence and say of course you are mad he shot your brother (meanwhile conveniently forgetting that you shot his brother before he shot yours).  We look at those who commit rape and never consider the crimes committed against them, or worse yet we look at those who have been raped and make excuses for them.  Poor thing she was raped no wonder she comes to work drunk everyday.  And I am not being facetious I have actually heard these things come out of different people.  </p>
<p>So I ask you all to consider what does it truly accomplish by allowing anger and revenge to reside in your heart.  Does it just cause more violence?  What could change if we were to look at diversity straight in the face and thank it?  Maybe we would have less violence.  Maybe there would be a tipping point.  Maybe we could achieve critical mass.  It&#8217;s your choice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>In 2006 I was taking a class at SFSU on genocide.  When we got to the holocaust my professor brought in a woman who survived the holocaust (she made it out alive) who was now thriving (she spoke regularly to students, wrote a book and appeared in documentaries).  Her story was powerful &#8212; she was just a young girl at the time.  She spoke of one young soldier that showed her kindness while at the Auschwitz concentration camp.  She was able to escape &#8212; but spent several days hiding in a ditch before she could get away.</p>
<p>That day listening to her speak I knew I had to start sharing my story again.  I asked her how she dealt with the memory of everything that had happened and she said she spent everyday working towards it and that sharing her experience was the biggest healer of them all.  When class was over I marched right over to the SFSU&#8217;s SAFE place, the organization on campus that helped those who had been raped.  I sat in the coordinators office and shared my experiences and how I dreamt of a day when colleges had a program as big as take back the night and the clothesline project but with an emphasis on looking at the positive.</p>
<p>Little did I know my co-worker at Harry Denton&#8217;s Starlight Room had a similar vision and was currently a volunteer at the SAFE place.  A few months later we ran into each other on campus, she was heading to SAFE place.  For the first time we really connected.  We had been co-workers for maybe a year but never really talked about what was real for both of us.  Over the course of the next few months we would sit for 20 minutes on Wednesday nights at work and dialogue about my experiences and the possibilities for real healing for others.  </p>
<p>One day she approached me and said I am putting on a program, Turning Negative Into Positive (TNIP) at SFSU and I want you to speak &#8212; and I am going to pay you.  She had just turned my world upside down, I knew I had things to say, but I had never considered before the true value in my story.  The program was a success and my speech was powerful.</p>
<p>Today TNIP has turned into a yearly program at SFSU, a non-profit Create Social Change and an after-school program for youth at-risk that will be launching in the fall of 2009.</p>
<p>Nicole and I are now best friends and each others biggest challenge at the same time.</p>
<p>If Gloria had never been through the holocaust, I wouldn&#8217;t be here today writing to you all.  There is divine perfection in every action or reaction.  If Castro had never taken over Cuba I would not be alive today.  These truths remain the same no matter how small or large the tragedy.</p>
<p>Today I thank Nicole, for being a wonderful friend and a dedicated business partner.  And I look forward to 5 years from now when we can look up and acknowledge the difference we made that stemmed from the staff break room at the Starlight Room</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Today I picked up a copy of the December 2008 Xpress Magazine.  Mostly because there is a 2-page spread interview of me in it.  The tag line under the article &#8220;Rape on the Rise&#8221; says &#8220;reports of sexual violence in San Francisco are increasing, and one victim chooses not just to survive, but thrive.&#8221;  The cover story is an article on bulimia &#8220;A man&#8217;s struggle for identity and survival,&#8221; and the article on the page right before mine is &#8220;A Story of Survival.</p>
<p>Its hard to read these stories.  A few pages before mine a young woman shares about her experience of being molested as a child. The feature story of a young man with bulimia shows several pictures of him still in skeletal form.  Then there are articles on cocaine addiction and a twenty year-old woman with Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma.  They are all stories of sadness.  What about the back story &#8212; about the greatness they have all created out of such tragedies?</p>
<p>The young woman who had been molested as a child and taken advantage of by older men &#8212; is finally in her first healthy relationship.  Johnny, the twenty-six year old struggling with bulimia speaks to victims through YouTube.  And Laura, well in a year if there are no more signs of cancer she would be witness to a miracle.</p>
<p>So then why are all these stories focused on the past?  Most people will read these and say &#8220;oh poor&#8230;&#8221;  I have already received numerous apologies about being raped, in fact I hear it every time I decide to announce to someone I have been raped.  The first thing they say is how sorry they are that I had to go through that.  Are people not hearing me, am I giving mixed signals?</p>
<p>I tell them all the same thing &#8212; its pretty much a canned speech.  &#8221;A man broke into my house when I was 17 and raped me&#8230;.when I saw him in court I forgave him&#8230;.today if I were to see him again I would thank him&#8230;&#8221;  What in that statement implies the need for an apology?  </p>
<p>I am hoping some people read this &#8212; and if you do, do me a favor and next time you see me say something like &#8220;well how good for you&#8221; or &#8220;you must be really blessed.&#8221;  Please don&#8217;t tell me how sorry you are for what I have been through, frankly its an insult.  </p>
<p>We have a saying that we share with the volunteers that come and staff a week long summer camp for youth at-risk.  They don&#8217;t need you to feel sorry for them and they don&#8217;t need you to solve their problems &#8212; they have their own answers.  </p>
<p>If these youth at-risk don&#8217;t need us to feel sorry for them when they are dealing with violence, drugs and a failing education system on a daily basis, then why would someone feel compelled to apologize to me over something that happened 10 years ago over a 30 minute time period?</p>
<p>Its time to think differently about challenges.  Think of the butterfly, it must struggle to get out of the cocoon to have the strength to soar&#8230;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p class="MsoNormal"><span>John 16:19</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#8220;I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices.  You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.  A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Philippians 3:12</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#8220;Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.  Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it.  But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Living in such a religious country &#8212; how is it that we have conveniently ignored what is plainly set out in the bible.  My friend Eric said &#8220;there is always a descent for the sake of an ascent.&#8221;  Is it not common knowledge to the masses that Christ was crucified to ascend into heaven?  If these things are true as are laid out in the bible &#8212; why do we all assume that when something bad happens that there was no God there &#8212; or assume that we are being punished?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I was fairly religious as a teenager.  I attended weekly bible studies and went on church trips and praised the lord every Sunday at my local church.  And I remember studying the book of Job.  At the time, I remember being truly perplexed about why God would test Job in the most brutal ways.  I never came to peace about it, I couldn&#8217;t possibly understand why my God &#8212; a loving God &#8212; would cause so much pain and hurt to one person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Job 42:10</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#8220;After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I am pretty sure I denied this line.  We cannot claim that God is Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscience and look at blessings and say thank you God &#8212; but then look at a tragedy over there and say where was God.  If God is Omni then there is an undeniable divine order in all things that happen in any moment.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If you are an atheist then consider Descartes.  In his third meditation Descartes makes a cosmological argument for the existence of God.  He uses the scientific method of cause having to be equal to or greater than the effect to make his proof.  He ponders the idea of God and tries to find what cause could be equal to or greater than the idea of God.  The only answer he finds it that an infinite substance is the only thing greater than the idea of God.  &#8221;So we shall come to understand that necessary existence is contained in the idea of a supremely powerful being, not by any fiction of the intellect, but because it belongs to the true and immutable nature of such a being that it exists.&#8221;<span>  </span>Something exists and whatever it is or whatever you call it, it is an infinite being.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now many of you may wonder why in the world is Chimine:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>a. Reading the bible</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>b. Sharing the bible with me</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>c. Talking about Descartes&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>d. What in the hell does any of this have to do with anything?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Well in my very warped mind it has everything to do with everything.  Many have heard me say my vision is to be a world-renowned public speaker.  But what on earth do I desire to speak about?  Deconstructing the current taboos, myths, beliefs, etc around violence &#8212; more specifically rape.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Is it not true that in our world we have been socialized to believe that crime is bad?  Take it a step further &#8212; I was told to not talk about what happened to me and every time I talk about it, there is a moment for the other person where they feel sorry for me.  For what?  Why do we feel sorry for those who have experienced crime, have we not just discussed Job or Christ and descent is necessary for ascent.  Sure that applies but only in cases where the person has come to terms with their tragedy.<span>  </span>Why?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>People tell me all the time how proud or amazed they are that I have the courage to do what I do.  Why?  I am simply doing what nature intended me to do; I found the blessing in my difficult times.  So why are we so afraid to hold this standard to everyone else around us?  This is where a survivor becomes an activist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I am NOT a survivor, I am an activist!  Society tells me to NOT be a victim but to &#8220;take back the night&#8221; and be a survivor.  Why in the world would I take back a night that gave me so many blessings?  I am thankful for that night and I thank a man named Steven Morales for breaking into my house January 8th, 1999.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So I challenge you all &#8212; consider your tragedies&#8230; Were they really tragedies or were they a blessing in disguise?  If you can find that to be true maybe next time someone tells you about a &#8220;tragedy&#8221; you can look at them and say how blessed you must be &#8212; you are ready to ascend&#8230;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So many things happen during the course of our lives.  We have comings and goings, joys and sorrows, pain and happiness, anger and forgiveness.  Sometimes we forget the true blessing in all of it.  I have always said that everything happens for a reason.  I had to believe that.  Mostly I needed it to be true when in the course of 2 months my grandmother passed away and I was raped.  I was only 17 &#8212; this was 10 years ago.  This January 8th I will be celebrating the 10 year anniversary of being raped, and in a few days on November 22nd I will be celebrating the 10 year anniversary of my grandmother&#8217;s death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Years ago I never thought I would get over either of these things.  Today I am grateful for these events.  It occurred to me years ago that my grandmother passed so she could be there with me when I was raped.  My grandmother was very religious &#8212; I never was.  And for some reason I knew the words to prayers that day, I said them over and over again in my head.  They kept me safe.  I came out of that day with no true injury, I was so lucky.  In most cases they talk about how as a criminal progresses their crimes get more heinous.  I was the last women, but I was the least hurt, emotionally and physically.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It also occurred to me many years ago that if I had never been raped &#8212; I may have never realized the power of my words.  Who knew that by being truly violated I could learn to deeply help and inspire others?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When I was 10 I gave a speech to my whole school about the Gulf War.  A friend of mine&#8217;s father was in combat.  I had so much to say about it, without even truly understanding what war was.  I forgot about this until recently when my mother reminded me of this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Point is, I always had the words and the compassion &#8212; but it took a truly difficult experience for me to embrace myself and my gifts to the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Today I sit here grateful, my grandmother passed so I wouldn&#8217;t be alone and I was raped to learn my own capacity for greatness.  Today I thank them both for the gifts they gave me.</span></p>
