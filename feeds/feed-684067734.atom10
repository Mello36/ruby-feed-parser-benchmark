Of course, things did get a bit bawdy yesterday, so (with one exception) I'm going to wait a bit before sharing them with you. Just consider it a refractory period. However, there are two important things I do need to mention with regard to the contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, Stevil Kinevil of &lt;a href="http://www.swobo.com/htatbl/"&gt;HTATBL&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href="http://guyswhocuttheirownhair.com/"&gt;GWCTOH&lt;/a&gt; as of late) has &lt;a href="http://www.guyswhocuttheirownhair.com/blog/detail/a_bounty_on_the_snobs_head/"&gt;generously offered to "sweeten the pot"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278525552451228818" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 171px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUEXBeutlJI/AAAAAAAAEBM/kIda0NizRmc/s400/Guys+Who+Cut+Their+Own+Hair+%7C+Blog+%7C+Detail+%7C+A+Bounty+On+The+Snobs+heAd.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's right. In addition to the &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST6Z4qxJbVI/AAAAAAAAD_0/uNOIA2n5rhU/s1600-h/pie+plate+con+schmata.jpg"&gt;pie plate&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SPitb1YlYKI/AAAAAAAADXw/sK_rCN_OG6o/s1600-h/bsnyc+wednesday+kit.JPG"&gt;smock&lt;/a&gt;, if you want it, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the Rapha cravat, because I need it to pick up gross stuff like pie plates and dead mice) he'll also give the winner a beer cozy and a lucky elk tooth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUEXHcDwqxI/AAAAAAAAEBU/Wia4Q00hXgo/s1600-h/coozieandtooth.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278525654813420306" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUEXHcDwqxI/AAAAAAAAEBU/Wia4Q00hXgo/s400/coozieandtooth.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please know that Stevil has offered to do this completely of his own volition, and I was deeply moved by his generosity since I'm sure these objects are very dear to him. So, just to recap, if you win you'll get: 1) a pie plate; 2) a dirty beer cozy; 3) a nasty animal tooth; and 4) a BSNYC/RTMS smock (which is really more of a booby prize). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, while I'm holding off on sharing the latest entries, I did mention there was one exception, and this is it: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUEXyx1R2GI/AAAAAAAAEBk/Urv6JGQebWE/s1600-h/anime.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278526399392634978" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 319px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUEXyx1R2GI/AAAAAAAAEBk/Urv6JGQebWE/s400/anime.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, I know I said I was taking a break from bawdy, but there's nothing "dirty" or "shameful" about the act of love when it's rendered artistically as it is here. You may have noticed that this image has been entirely created using &lt;a href="http://www.pedalmafia.com/mafid/mafia_id.html"&gt;that Pedalmafia bike builder thing&lt;/a&gt;. To be able to create such moving artwork with such a limited palette is nothing short of miraculous. It's like Jesus multiplying the loaves and the fishes, or like that Hanukkah lamp oil lasting eight days, or like Michael Ball somehow wringing a few more years out of a bunch of washed-up riders. Also, it uses &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/09/frog-in-throat-diagnosing-your-bicycle.html"&gt;hipster cysts&lt;/a&gt; for the pants yabbies. Truly inspirational. This person could very well have clicked and dragged his way to a free animal tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving on, yesterday a reader asked an important question in the comments section:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I realize a properly adjusted der shouldn't drop a chain into the spokes, but it can be a fairly costly mistake when it happens. It seems you appreciate the value of clutter like brakes and bar tape, so why are pie plates such a no-no?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: earnest question, no criticism or irony intended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the answer is almost painfully simple, but then again the best questions are often the simplest ones and I feel it's worth answering. After all, this question made me think a lot about necessity, and the answer is that brakes and bar tape (or grips) are necessary, but pie plates are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, plenty of people now ride around without brakes or any form of grip, but I maintain they're still necessary. If you want to get the most out of your bike, you'll use both of these things. (I've explored how &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/04/its-all-in-details-how-to-be-fast-on.html"&gt;brakes actually make you faster&lt;/a&gt; in the past.) More importantly, you &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; them &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; you're riding. The pie plate, on the other hand, just sits there idly waiting for something extremely unlikely to happen. In fact, chances are very good that this unlikely thing may never happen at all. In one way the pie plate is like a person sitting alone on top of a hill, night after night for years on end, waiting for a bunch of probe-wielding aliens to arrive in a spaceship. And in another way, it's like the person with a bomb shelter in his basement filled with a 20-year supply of water and canned tuna. And in both cases, they're so preoccupied with what might happen that they neglect their daily lives. (Like the pie-plated rider with a decrepit, rusty drivetrain and a derailleur that hasn't moved since "Risky Business" came out.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, there are plenty of other things that can happen on the bike for which we don't make provisions. For example, it's not uncommon for your bars to rotate forward if you hit a nasty bump. This can be dangerous, especially during a race. Should you then put some sort of redundant device on your bicycle that further secures the bars in the event the stem clamp alone is not sufficient, like some sort of brace between the bottom of the brake levers and the headtube? Absolutely not. Instead, you should use a well-designed stem, tighten it sufficiently, and avoid dangerous road hazards--just as you should make sure your derailleur is adjusted properly.&lt;/p&gt;And this is what is most insidious about the pie plate. It is a symbol of our lack of personal responsibility as a society, a giant plastic disc shouting "Save me, for I cannot save myself!" And unlike its frontal counterpart the &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_l.html"&gt;"lawyer lip"&lt;/a&gt; it does not even have the decency to hide itself. Indeed, probably the last time a pie plate was even remotely necessary was when this photo of Fausto Coppi (forwarded to me by a reader) was taken:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUFGGpqQXUI/AAAAAAAAEB0/mLkUm2w9TTI/s1600-h/coppi.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278577318331178306" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 360px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUFGGpqQXUI/AAAAAAAAEB0/mLkUm2w9TTI/s400/coppi.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You'll notice that Coppi is running ("rocking" hadn't been invented yet) a Campagnolo rod shifter here. Given that shifting with one of these was probably like trying to dial a cell phone with a pool noodle, the pie plate was certainly warranted. But those days are behind us now. By the way, Coppi died of malaria too, and you're probably about as likely to contract malaria while out on your ride as you are to shift your derailleur into your spokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I suppose people have different ideas of what's necessary. Personally, I feel that fenders are necessary (for everyday bikes, not for race bikes), but plenty of people go without them. In fact, you're about as likely to see a fully-fendered bicycle in New York City as you are a pie plate on a fixed-gear. (This excludes old three-speeds, which pretty much always have fenders and which cling to New York City streetsigns like moss to trees.) And I'm not just talking about bikes that don't have the necessary eyelets or frame clearances for fenders. I'm talking about bikes with cantis and gaping, yawning spaces between the tires and stays that are inexplicably ridden in the rain with no protection whatsoever. And it's not like these people aren't putting other stuff on these bikes, either. Some of these bikes not only have bar-ends, but their bar-ends have bar-ends. I guess it's just because people only think about getting fenders when it rains, and by then they're already wet so they figure, "Why bother?". Still, when I see someone commuting in a downpour on a touring bike with a pie plate and no fenders it makes me want to weep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more perplexing are people who ride without fenders in the city are people who ride with suspension. Another commenter from yesterday wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get over the fixed gear bashing. There's twice as many Mountain bike riders on the streets of SF than roadies and fixed combined. Don't hear you talking shit about these goof balls with their $600 front shox to absorb the occasional MUNI track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My guess is that your ironic Orange Julius bike is in fact a custom Stumpjumper and you wouldn't know a single track from a heart attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stump on, Snobby!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You still see this sort of behavior sometimes in New York City, but it's not nearly as common as it used to be. However, during the (first) heyday of purple anodized CNC componentry, customized mountain bikes that never saw dirt were common on the streets of New York City in much the same way that custom track bikes that have never seen a velodrome are common today. Similarly, just like owners of high-end track bikes now like to say, "Yeah, I really want to get out to the track but I just don't have time," owners of high-end cross-country bikes then would say, "Yeah, I really want to get out to some trails but I just don't have time." While these excuses might seem flimsy, I maintain they're quite valid. Hunting for that vintage Italian stem (or that purple anodized peace sign canti straddle wire hanger) can be extremely time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the aforementioned comment, Kale replied:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SF Riding:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having lived in both places I can attest to the superior ability of the mtb in SF/BA. That aside, it's been pretty much impossible until the recent SSMTB trend to get a new mtb without 100mm or more squish stock, and if you want to put a (Surly/Kona) aftermarket or recycled solid, that's way above most people's ability (not to mention fixing a flat). However, the few, if any, mtbs in NYC are ridden by the hardest working Thai delivery people in the world. Those Schwinns, Iron Horses, and Pacifics are the only fully squish you'll see, they're definitely goof balls, and they outnumber roadies and fixters by at least 3 orders of magnitude. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see Kale mention the mountain bike-riding food delivery person. Like any group of working cyclists, there's the rank-and-file, and then there's the elite. This is what the elite food delivery people in NYC ride:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUE3Dd_Tv-I/AAAAAAAAEBs/MNclgNvtpNY/s1600-h/delivery+bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278560770984230882" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUE3Dd_Tv-I/AAAAAAAAEBs/MNclgNvtpNY/s400/delivery+bike.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Note the fenders, which are always mounted extra-high to accommodate suspension travel that isn't there. Note also the color-coordinated full frame-taping job, the skewers secured with hose clamps, and the downward-tilted saddle, which are also typical. (The saddle angle not only allows for easy mounts and dismounts when the rider is loaded down with six bags of food, but also allows some seatpost to remain exposed for aesthetic reasons, since these riders are often short of stature and generally use bikes that are at least two sizes too big for them. Perhaps most importantly, with that giant fender sticking out back there the only way off the bike is to slide off the front of the saddle.) Sometimes you'll even see road cranks used, which is the case here. These people do indeed work hard, in all weather, and they make absolutely no distinction between the street and the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the days of the hardcore MTB-riding food delivery person may be numbered, because in the trendy parts of Brooklyn at least the "fixters" have begun taking their jobs. (I guess they're not content to just take their apartments.) So now when you order from restaurants in Williamsburg or Prospect Heights your food may very well be brought to you by someone with a degree from RISD who's riding an NJS track bike. Not that there's anything wrong with that, though I doubt the Honduran immigrants are getting their graphic arts jobs in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, component choice all boils down to "Style Vs. Safety"--at least &lt;a href="http://knol.google.com/k/j-j/the-fixed-gear-bike-brake-debate/3lclmfoq1smlb/1#"&gt;according to this Google Knol&lt;/a&gt;. The author makes some compelling points here, such as this one: "A brake is basically a training wheel – a crutch. When you have a fixed gear bike, the mere technology allows you to stop without one. A non-fixed bike doesn’t have this luxury. It NEEDS a brake to stop in any manner. But we’re not talking about non fixies. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about fenders? Are they crutches too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/3489735565342073593/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=3489735565342073593' title='164 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/3489735565342073593'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/3489735565342073593'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-all-in-details-component-or-crutch.html' title='It&apos;s All in the Details: Component or Crutch?'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUEXBeutlJI/AAAAAAAAEBM/kIda0NizRmc/s72-c/Guys+Who+Cut+Their+Own+Hair+%7C+Blog+%7C+Detail+%7C+A+Bounty+On+The+Snobs+heAd.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>164</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-6510125928697419040</id><published>2008-12-10T08:15:00.020-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-10T13:40:50.952-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='p-far'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixed-gear'/><title type='text'>Fitment Issues: K.O.P.S. vs. C.O.P.S.</title><content type='html'>No sooner did I announce &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/contests-and-con-tests-men-behind.html"&gt;The Great BSNYC/RTMS Fyxomatosis Photo Parody Contest&lt;/a&gt; (presented by the &lt;a href="http://www.cheesemonthclub.com/"&gt;Gourmet Cheese of the Month Club&lt;/a&gt;) than the submissions began to roll in. You'll note that I didn't put forth much in the way of rules, since mixing "rules" and "art" is like mixing Shimano and Campy and I didn't want to inhibit anyone's creativity. Unfortunately though, I should have at least specified "no testicles," because one of the first photographs I received was this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BGueXX3I/AAAAAAAAD_8/PKdR5x0BksQ/s1600-h/ball.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278149609600278386" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 298px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BGueXX3I/AAAAAAAAD_8/PKdR5x0BksQ/s400/ball.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After burning my monitor and purchasing a new one I sent the contestant a sternly-worded email, though I did offer him a second chance and I'm pleased to say he redeemed himself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BN8I_L1I/AAAAAAAAEAE/fpsF8xqdjD4/s1600-h/Urban_Assault_002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278149733527793490" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BN8I_L1I/AAAAAAAAEAE/fpsF8xqdjD4/s400/Urban_Assault_002.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is infinitely more tasteful and a solid effort. The singlespeed mountain bike is the track bike's dirtier, uglier second cousin (just as the clear chainring guard is the pie plate's chunkier and only slightly less dorky half-brother), and the Foster's can represents &lt;a href="http://www.fyxomatosis.com/"&gt;Fyxomatosis&lt;/a&gt;. Note also the placement of the Foster's (or, as they call it in Australia, "breakfast), which as you can see has been "kicked to the curb" (or, as they call it in Australia, the "kerb"). He's even managed to slip in an Obama spoke card and a &lt;a href="http://www.sockguy.com/product1087.html"&gt;Pentabike sock&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps most importantly, no testicles are in evidence. (Or, as they call them in Australia, "pants yabbies.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;Here's another salacious submission:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BYxG7HjI/AAAAAAAAEAM/G8ZIAe_DzMc/s1600-h/Spread.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278149919544909362" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BYxG7HjI/AAAAAAAAEAM/G8ZIAe_DzMc/s400/Spread.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's becoming increasingly clear to me that I've opened a Pandora's can of worms with this contest. I refuse to make any cheap comments about the track ends and "rear entry," though I do reserve the right to gloat about my refusal, and I maintain that alluding to a tasteless comment is different from actually making it. (Saying you haven't done something even when you just did it is called an "Australian denial.") I also think it's worth pointing out that any spouse or significant other walking in on this photo shoot would very quickly get the wrong idea, so I want to state unequivocally that this site shall not be responsible for any domestic disputes resulting in putting underpants on bicycles. (Or, as they call putting underpants on bicycles in Australia, "Saturday night.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, speaking of mountain bikes, pie plates, and extreme naughtiness, it just so happens that even before I announced the Fyxomatosis contest a reader sent me this photo involving a pie-plated mountain bike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_FgdVImyI/AAAAAAAAEAU/-moIOVl5-EY/s1600-h/porno+for+pie+plates.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278154449721269026" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 257px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_FgdVImyI/AAAAAAAAEAU/-moIOVl5-EY/s400/porno+for+pie+plates.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Because the original photo is highly unsafe for work, notice I have dressed the model in colors that match her bicycle. (She already had the gloves and shoes.) Notice also that I have not made any tasteless jokes about "exposed pie plates." (That's another "Australian denial.") If you want to see the original and you are either not at work or you work in the sort of place where it's perfectly acceptable to look at explicit pornography (like Starbucks corporate headquarters, or the Parliament of Australia, or any company in France), it's &lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://hosted.femjoy.com/galleries/111939_bau584_bxv304/?affid=1031824"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;. If you can't look but you're still curious, I'll just tell you she's pretty much doing what most fixed-gear freestylers do, which is climbing all over the bike without actually riding it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;Yes, fixed-gear freestyling can sometimes be a fashion show. Literally. Just take a look at &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/2426213"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_K9FeFn4I/AAAAAAAAEAc/3xGl95SGwP4/s1600-h/fixie+fashion+show.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278160439090716546" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 233px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_K9FeFn4I/AAAAAAAAEAc/3xGl95SGwP4/s400/fixie+fashion+show.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Naturally I immediately performed the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/contests-and-con-tests-men-behind.html"&gt;BSNYC/RTMS Fixed-Gear Video Test&lt;/a&gt; on this. While the Celine Dion music didn't match up too well, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfz94Wi_A-Q"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; did. In fact, I think in Smash Mouth's "All Star" I may very well have found the perfect fixed-gear video soundtrack. It works with absolutely everything. I'm not sure why this is, but I suppose it has something to do with the fact that it's cartoonish, irritating, and massively overplayed, with just a hint of contrived "edginess." Celine's great for the videos with high production values, but she's just a little too &lt;em&gt;schmaltzy&lt;/em&gt; for the "grittier" stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;In addition to discovering the perfect fixed-gear video soundtrack, I think I may also have discovered the missing link between the fixed-gear trend and the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/penny-ante-ordinary-trend-moves-up.html"&gt;p-far trend&lt;/a&gt;. And that link is the elephant trunk skid:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_8bJxEsfI/AAAAAAAAEA0/Z_JmHY1ZjnI/s1600-h/leg+over+bar.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278214831709925874" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 273px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_8bJxEsfI/AAAAAAAAEA0/Z_JmHY1ZjnI/s400/leg+over+bar.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I don't know why I didn't notice this sooner, but it's obvious to me now that the elephant trunk skid is simply a subconscious attempt to mimic the penny-farthing riding style:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUAHx_BqCjI/AAAAAAAAEBE/YnEH88Fj_gQ/s1600-h/pfar+dna.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278227318591588914" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 326px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 336px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SUAHx_BqCjI/AAAAAAAAEBE/YnEH88Fj_gQ/s400/pfar+dna.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(Fixters look up to p-fars. Way up.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;I can only surmise that there must be something in the DNA of certain riders that compels them to clamber up atop the front wheel in this matter, and I also suspect that many of them will never be satisfied until they own actual p-fars. Until they do, they will continue to compulsively straddle their Aerospokes and Hed tri-spokes and Spinergy Rev-Xes in the same way that Richard Dreyfuss couldn't stop himself from sculpting that mountain in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;But while &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/kops.html#kops"&gt;K.O.P.S.&lt;/a&gt; isn't for everyone, neither is C.O.P.S. ("Crotch Over Pedal Spindle," the p-far fitting rule of thumb). I was thumbing through the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Style Magazine&lt;/em&gt; (don't ask me how these awful things find their way into my bathroom) when I noticed this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_NT8CPcVI/AAAAAAAAEAs/QofUEIjNg9U/s1600-h/michael+bruno.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278163030718247250" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 292px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_NT8CPcVI/AAAAAAAAEAs/QofUEIjNg9U/s400/michael+bruno.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yes, it's an essential bit of journalism about some sockless rich guy and all his expensive crap. Notice that like many sockless rich guys with expensive crap, he has a relatively inexpensive and useless bicycle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“He describes his Electra Townie 21-speed (around $500) as a beach cruiser on steroids. ‘The pedals are positioned slightly forward, so you can ride forever and not get tired.’”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, that's not just misinformation--it's misinformation on steroids. If positioning your feet slightly forward on a bicycle meant you could ride forever without getting tired then recumbents would be perpetual motion machines. (As it is, they're just perpetual embarrassment machines.) Granted, I have no recumbent riding experience, but I'm fairly certain they tire you out eventually. Then again, I could be wrong. Maybe some of these guys have been riding around for years, stopping only to feed themselves at drive-thru fast food restaurants. (That could explain while they all have beards and ample midriffs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I'd like to announce that I'm about to "drop" a "collabo." Many of you probably saw this coming, and I can now confirm that the rumors are true and I'm finally about to release &lt;a href="http://br.youtube.com/watch?v=QMIU75wuoD4"&gt;my own line of paper towels&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_LfDg7hMI/AAAAAAAAEAk/65z0MzATpMY/s1600-h/YouTube+-+Toalha+Snob.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278161022681318594" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 257px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_LfDg7hMI/AAAAAAAAEAk/65z0MzATpMY/s400/YouTube+-+Toalha+Snob.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As you can see, I've been test-marketing them in Brazil, where they've been a smashing success. Not only are they highly absorbent, but in a pinch you can use them to make &lt;em&gt;yarmulkes&lt;/em&gt;. I'm also looking for the perfect pitch person, preferably a pro rider famous for crashing a lot.  I'm currently in talks with Cadel Evans. "When I take a spill on the bike, I drop back to the team car. But when I spill my Foster's, I reach for a roll of Snob." Cadel will tell you he's not considering it, but that's just an Australian denial.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/6510125928697419040/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=6510125928697419040' title='115 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/6510125928697419040'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/6510125928697419040'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/fitment-issues-kops-vs-cops.html' title='Fitment Issues: K.O.P.S. vs. C.O.P.S.'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST_BGueXX3I/AAAAAAAAD_8/PKdR5x0BksQ/s72-c/ball.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>115</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-3494794965699965497</id><published>2008-12-09T08:24:00.019-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-09T12:44:09.032-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fixed-gear freestyle'/><title type='text'>Contests and Con-Tests: Men Behind Curtains</title><content type='html'>I awoke this morning from dreams of dancing Modolo Morphos shifters and fauns playing delightful tunes in the Swiss alps on flutes made from BMC carbon nanotubes only to make a horrible discovery. It appears that the website &lt;a href="http://www.fyxomatosis.com/"&gt;Fyxomatosis&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.fyxomatosis.com/news.php?readmore=1332"&gt;placed some kind of &lt;em&gt;fatwa&lt;/em&gt; on me&lt;/a&gt;. (Or, since it is a fixed-gear website, I guess it's more like a &lt;em&gt;fixtwa&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST598beAuDI/AAAAAAAAD-4/pYEugvMi6H0/s1600-h/fyxomatosis+-+the+fixed+gear+_+track+bike+disease+-+photography+-+Vintage+Track+Frames+-+Velo+entertainment+for+kids,+big+and+small..jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277794290444056626" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 316px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST598beAuDI/AAAAAAAAD-4/pYEugvMi6H0/s400/fyxomatosis+-+the+fixed+gear+_+track+bike+disease+-+photography+-+Vintage+Track+Frames+-+Velo+entertainment+for+kids,+big+and+small..jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Alas, I should have known it would come to this. I must say I was disappointed that all they're offering is a chainring and a t-shirt, though. Not that I think I'm worth &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than a chainring or a t-shirt, but it would be nice if the chainring was at least ramped and pinned. At the same time, though, I'll also admit to being a bit flattered. I haven't had a Bounty on my head since middle school, when I committed the faux-pas of arriving at Brett Lipschultz's Bar Mitzvah &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;yarmulke&lt;/em&gt; and had to improvise with a piece of paper towel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I suppose this means I should "defend" myself somehow. And as any road racer knows, you should always answer an attack with a counter-attack. Granted, I usually just sit at the back and yell "Close that gap!," but not this time. If you've ever visited Fyxomatosis, you know that it features highly stylized, sometimes tongue-in-cheek, and often quasi-sexual photographs of bikes, as evidenced by this Colnago crotch shot: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST5_AO1nnzI/AAAAAAAAD_I/YRvgrd3KFKw/s1600-h/colnago+crotch+shot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277795455284518706" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 267px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST5_AO1nnzI/AAAAAAAAD_I/YRvgrd3KFKw/s400/colnago+crotch+shot.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I'm prepared to offer a pie plate to the reader who submits the best Fyxomatosis parody photograph. It should be an actual photograph (not a photoshop) and it should be &lt;a href="http://www.fyxomatosis.com/viewpage.php?page_id=26"&gt;in the Fyxomatosis style&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically high-class bike porn. Special consideration will be given to submissions that include human models. Here's the pie plate, so you know I'm not lying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST6Z4qxJbVI/AAAAAAAAD_0/uNOIA2n5rhU/s1600-h/pie+plate+con+schmata.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277825012156951890" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST6Z4qxJbVI/AAAAAAAAD_0/uNOIA2n5rhU/s400/pie+plate+con+schmata.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I'm too disgusted by the pie plate to even touch it, so I'm handling it with my Rapha silk cravat. (My Rapha silk cravat has come in very handy for handling things I don't want to touch.) By the way, here's the chainring Fyxomatosis is offering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST5-f13KmFI/AAAAAAAAD_A/32PNdXL0NA0/s1600-h/fyxomatosis+chainring.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277794898824304722" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 325px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST5-f13KmFI/AAAAAAAAD_A/32PNdXL0NA0/s400/fyxomatosis+chainring.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chainring or pie plate? You decide. (By the way, if you win, I'll even include a &lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SPitb1YlYKI/AAAAAAAADXw/sK_rCN_OG6o/s1600-h/bsnyc+wednesday+kit.JPG"&gt;smock&lt;/a&gt; with the pie plate if you want one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of bike porn, a reader has sent me &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/2278701"&gt;this disturbing video&lt;/a&gt;, which includes perhaps the most boring example of fixed-gear freestyling I've ever seen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST5xnJ_fW5I/AAAAAAAAD-o/eyUgD2n0PNY/s1600-h/Council+of+Doom+premiere+in+Milan+on+Vimeo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277780730835852178" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 303px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST5xnJ_fW5I/AAAAAAAAD-o/eyUgD2n0PNY/s400/Council+of+Doom+premiere+in+Milan+on+Vimeo.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The reader surmised that the rider was attempting to copulate with his bike, but to me it simply evokes a baby chimp clinging lovingly to its mother.  This video was apparently taken at the Milan premiere of something called the "Council of Doom," which turns out to be another one of these fixed-gear movies, like &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.mashsf.com"&gt;MASH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.macaframaproductions.com/"&gt;Macaframa&lt;/a&gt;.  (At first I confused them with the "Minyan of Disorder," which was the name of the Jewish hair metal band that played at Brett Lipschultz's Bar Mitzvah.)  Intrigued, I checked out &lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/796328"&gt;the trailer for the film&lt;/a&gt;, which contains lots of dandily-dressed fellows doing those elephant trunk skids in picturesque settings.

These guys also ride &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, as you can tell by this guy, who has ridden hard enough to incur a hurtie owie boo-boo on his footsie-tootsy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST6AIU0alwI/AAAAAAAAD_s/gL4UCxTxDAs/s1600-h/boo+boo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277796693840664322" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 282px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST6AIU0alwI/AAAAAAAAD_s/gL4UCxTxDAs/s400/boo+boo.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I only hope the guy in the pink shirt who looks like Zach Galifianakis gave it a big kiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've long struggled to figure out what drives this compulsion to film the act of bike-riding and make it look more dangerous than it really is, and I think I've finally figured it out: it's music.  Specifically, it's the advent of portable music players.  See, it used to be inconvenient to listen to music on a bicycle.  First, you had to carry a bulky portable cassette player.  Then came portable CD players, but those were even bigger, and they skipped like crazy.  But now that you've got devices like the Zune (and its Apple knockoff, the "iPod"), riding around with a soundtrack is easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is dangerous--and not for the reasons you'd think.  Sure, listening to loud music is risky because you can't hear traffic, but if you keep the volume low enough it is possible to both hear the music and the outside world.  No, listening to music while riding in traffic is dangerous because it can make you delusional.  When people add a soundtrack to their rides they can get a little too carried away with the fantasy and start riding outside their ability.  First you're just riding along on your Pista, then some adrenaline-spiked song comes on your iPod, and next thing you know you're jumping in with a pack of strong roadies or something.  But of course you can't hang, and soon you're slipping off the back of the pack like a koala trying to mount the greased hindquarters of a rhinoceros.  And that's to say nothing of trying to beat that bus through the intersection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The makers of these videos rely on the same effect--you'll notice these videos are always accompanied by aggressive music.  This makes the riding seem outsized.  However, the riding is generally a lot tamer than the music, and once you're aware of the smoke-and-mirrors effect a soundtrack can have often the effect is dispelled and you realize the only thing outsized are the egos.  To that end, I've developed a litmus test that you can apply to any video in order to determine whether you're watching cutting-edge riding or just some guys parading the latest streetwear:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BSNYC/RTMS Fixed-Gear Video Test&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Open the video to be tested in a new browser window.  (In this case the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/796328"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Council of Doom" trailer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Pause the video and turn the volume on the video player all the way down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Open a second browser window and go &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO_vFuzPJvc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.  Turn the volume on the player all the way up, play the video, and minimize the window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Return to the first window containing your test video, click play, and watch it with the new soundtrack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I performed this test on the "Council of Doom" trailer myself, and was surprised to find not only that the riding looked a lot tamer but also that the new music actually fit better than the original soundtrack.  It also worked great with the &lt;a href="http://www.macaframaproductions.com/movies.html"&gt;Macaframa stuff&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I must confess that the &lt;a href="http://empirebegins.com/"&gt;Empire Begins&lt;/a&gt; trailer did pass my Fixed-Gear Video Test in that the new soundtrack didn't work as well as the original, though I suspected this was not due to the riding and was instead because of the New York City backdrop and its lack of palm trees and cleanliness.  So I subjected it to further testing, substituting the music in Step 3 with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQJsPGD1t0g"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  Sure enough, the new soundtrack fit like a Knog love/hate glove.  Just to be doubly certain, I also tried it with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjToSufqRsE"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which also worked uncannily well.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I have seen the man behind the curtain, and that man is Nell Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/3494794965699965497/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=3494794965699965497' title='155 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/3494794965699965497'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/3494794965699965497'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/contests-and-con-tests-men-behind.html' title='Contests and Con-Tests: Men Behind Curtains'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST598beAuDI/AAAAAAAAD-4/pYEugvMi6H0/s72-c/fyxomatosis+-+the+fixed+gear+_+track+bike+disease+-+photography+-+Vintage+Track+Frames+-+Velo+entertainment+for+kids,+big+and+small..jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>155</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-6308041987542424744</id><published>2008-12-08T09:01:00.024-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-08T15:52:48.097-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='worst of craigslist'/><title type='text'>Velo Noir: The Bike Dick</title><content type='html'>Not too long ago, I encountered a sight more inspirational than a thousand &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SPdjSN-bLkI/AAAAAAAADXI/O1_EpoQHeVw/s1600-h/obama.jpg"&gt;Obama campaign posters&lt;/a&gt;. That sight, of course, was &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/indignity-of-commuting-by-bicycle-anger.html?showComment=1225995120000"&gt;an Access-a-Ride van getting stopped by the police&lt;/a&gt;. Frankly, I couldn't imagine street justice being meted out more deservingly--that is, until a reader forwarded me this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST1G7YgMQwI/AAAAAAAAD-Q/nrDLfKlWEeY/s1600-h/access-a-oops[1].JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277452324351787778" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST1G7YgMQwI/AAAAAAAAD-Q/nrDLfKlWEeY/s400/access-a-oops%5B1%5D.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yes, that is indeed an Access-a-Ride van getting rear-ended by an Access-a-Ride car, and I deeply regret that I was not there to see it. The only more satisfying collision I can imagine would be between a brakeless fixed-gear rider and &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/owning-your-bike-all-you-haters-hold.html"&gt;that idiot who was walking in the bike lane with his breakfast last week&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, it does stand to reason that any two Access-a-Ride vehicles that come within a block of each-other would inevitably collide. After all, there's a 50% chance that a solo Access-a-Ride vehicle is going to crash into something at any given time anyway, so logically chances double to 100% when there are two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in these difficult times, the truth is that we need all the inspiration we can get. In case you haven't noticed, it's getting ugly out there. Way back in February, I reported &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/02/endangered-specious-save-messengers.html"&gt;that bike messengers in Seattle were becoming extinct&lt;/a&gt;. (Which of course led to the short-lived "&lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-just-in-save-messengers-campaign.html"&gt;Save the Messengers&lt;/a&gt;" campaign.) In particular, I recommended starting an "adopt-a-courier" program for unemployed messengers. Well, it seems the hard times have spread to New York, because at least one would-be messenger has put himself up for adoption:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0o0YeTENI/AAAAAAAAD84/AFCm5bpU8kY/s1600-h/BIKE+MESSENGER_DELIVERY.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277419218735927506" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 136px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0o0YeTENI/AAAAAAAAD84/AFCm5bpU8kY/s400/BIKE+MESSENGER_DELIVERY.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bik/946079134.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIKE MESSENGER/DELIVERY - $9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Lower East Side)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: see below&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-12-05, 11:58AM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a biker who is looking for a job where I can use my bike. I have amazing bike riding skills and can navagate through NY city easily.I know this city like the back of my hand and can deliver messages, packages or food. I know how to ride safely and quickly.I come with 2 of my own bikes and cell phone. I ask for an hourly pay of 9.00 and up. If you are looking for an experienced biker email me at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:a.cooper24@yahoo.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a.cooper24@yahoo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of the holiday season, I hope someone out there can find it in his or her heart to employ someone with amazing bike riding skills. After all, amazing bike riding skills don't exactly grow on trees (even though &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8CDPJgxqI/AAAAAAAADh4/aEfLfMzB0SI/s1600-h/bikes+in+tree.jpg"&gt;amazingly ugly bikes do&lt;/a&gt;), and $9 is very little to pay for the convenience of having someone return that overdue library book for you, or go fetch that hat you left at your friend's house, or (if you have OCD) to have someone who can go back and forth to your house all day to make sure you didn't leave the oven on. Even if you don't need his services, a gift certificate for an hour of messenger service makes for a great stocking stuffer. He even comes with "2 of my own bikes and a cell phone," just like some kind of messenger action figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it's good to see cyclists joining the ranks of people who seek compensation simply for doing something fun and unnecessary, just like mediocre guitar players or men who try to sell their bodies to women. (And we all know &lt;a href="http://flattland.com/images/midnight_cowboy_01.jpg"&gt;how that turns out&lt;/a&gt;.) With any luck, our freelance messenger will never have to do anything he doesn't want to do, or worse yet, actually go to work for a messenger service. But at least if his courier-for-hire thing doesn't work out he can always become a bike detective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST1XrXyYl0I/AAAAAAAAD-Y/lSJ4OczBCNw/s1600-h/stolen+nagasawa.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277470740979423042" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 224px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST1XrXyYl0I/AAAAAAAAD-Y/lSJ4OczBCNw/s400/stolen+nagasawa.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bik/944824384.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward$$$$$ stolen Nagasawa!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reply to: sale-944824384@craigslist.org [?]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-12-04, 1:07PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bike was stolen on the 11th of last month in Brooklyn. Please help me find it. I'm offering a nice cash reward for it's return. It will be worth your time to return it. Help me out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of people using exotic bicycles with expensive components to ride around the streets of New York City only continues to increase. Consequently, so does theft. Yet the only phrase less likely to spur a cop into action than "My bike was just stolen!" is "I sent my laundry out and when I picked it up one of my sweatsocks was missing!" (Hint: telling the cops your frame was NJS won't impart any more urgency to the proceedings, either.) As such, I think the time is ripe for a full-time private bike detective. Part Philip Marlowe and part Ace Ventura, he will comb the back alleys, Chinese take-out restaurants, and Craigslist chop shops of New York City in order to reunite fixters with their "whips." He will also chase down villains with his "amazing bike riding skills," and like Ace Ventura he will even talk out of his ass. (Talking out of your ass is essential when dealing with fixters and missing NJS frames.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0vN8zm0XI/AAAAAAAAD-A/2vfUwiI_cQk/s1600-h/Stolen+Track+Bike+--+Orange+Samson+--+Grand+Street.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277426255055475058" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 62px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0vN8zm0XI/AAAAAAAAD-A/2vfUwiI_cQk/s400/Stolen+Track+Bike+--+Orange+Samson+--+Grand+Street.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bik/944214586.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stolen Track Bike -- Orange Samson -- Grand Street - $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Lower East Side)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: see below&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-12-03, 10:25PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken on Grand at Essex.

Holla at me&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is hope, and this post goes to show that sometimes bikes are found. The person who found this bike would clearly make an excellent bike detective too, not only because he's the kind of person who somehow finds himself in situations where shady people are inviting him into basements, but also because he then actually goes into those basements despite the obvious risks. (I on the other hand would make a terrible bike detective, since I won't even go into the basements of people I know and trust.) He shouldn't have too much trouble finding the owner either. Very few of those Balblablabla hubs were ever made. They're very ornate and highly recognizable too, thanks to their trademark fish-mouth grease ports, scaly hub shells, and fin-shaped skewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0qAfLTl2I/AAAAAAAAD9Q/I6aEVrXKMco/s1600-h/Vintage+Italian+Track+Frame-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277420526205376354" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 161px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0qAfLTl2I/AAAAAAAAD9Q/I6aEVrXKMco/s400/Vintage+Italian+Track+Frame-1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bik/949458869.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vintage Italian Track Frame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-12-08, 8:09AM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the frame from Continuum Cylces in Manhattan. It was beat up but you could tell it was, at one point, a beautiful frame. The owner (who told me that the frame was his) suggested that it was a Giordana, and the markings seen on the second picture seem to suggest that it's at least an Italian vintage. I bought the frame and brought it to Chelsea Bikes where the top tube (which was cracked) was replaced and the entire frame was given a clear coat. I returned the frame to Continuum where it was built out with all new parts, including fork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this bike. Truly an unique gem. A fast, elegant ride. All steel. It's just too big for me. I knew it when I bought it, I just hoped I'd get used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact me for more pictures or questions. The bike is going for $2000, or best offer, though I've had offers near that amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's stamped a size 56". The top tube measures 58".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I hate to see people's bikes get stolen, I also can't help getting irritated when those bikes are disproportionately expensive. Sure, not everybody has a beater bike, but if you do only have one bike and you lock it up in a city like New York you might want to think about buying a second bike for $250 before you upgrade to that $300 hubset. That's one of the many reasons why, if you're in the market for an urban runabout, I'd avoid the $2,000 rehabilitated mystery bike above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must admit, though, that I found the ad compelling. First of all, I was intrigued by the bike's mysterious provenance: notice that the previous owner "suggested it was a Giordana." I'm not sure Giordanas are highly-coveted bicycles anyway, but nonetheless suggesting something without saying it outright is a highly effective sales tactic. I've even used it myself: "I'm not saying this bike &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a Colnago. All I'm saying is that if you peel off those Pacific decals you never know what you'll find under there." Hey, it may be misleading, but it's not a &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt;. Secondly, I'm not sure why the owner thought he'd get used to a frame that's too big for him. Maybe the person who sold it to him also said, "I'm not saying this bike will fit you like a glove, but I will say if you buy it you very well might get used to it." And that's like falling for the old, "Don't worry, they'll stretch" line when you're buying shoes. Finally, it seems that the current owner is picking up some of the sneaky tactics of the person who sold him the bike, since he's selling it "for $2000, or best offer, though I've had offers near that amount." If he's had already had offers close to $2,000 and he's willing to sell it for $2,000 &lt;em&gt;or best offer&lt;/em&gt;, then why does he still have the thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the seller can engage the private bike detective to find out who made his bike. And here's yet another bike-related crime on the verge of being solved, which was posted in the "Missed Connections:"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST1tfHuJ3aI/AAAAAAAAD-g/Jr3tR_hQ770/s1600-h/iphone+attack.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277494719764094370" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 151px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST1tfHuJ3aI/AAAAAAAAD-g/Jr3tR_hQ770/s400/iphone+attack.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mis/947562040.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the kid who hit a car w/bike, got beaten up, iPhone smashed, etc - 27&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Bushwick)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-12-06, 2:13PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a post written a few weeks ago by the guy you got smashed up by- he's a real dick and he ended his post by suggesting you meet him at an Agnostic Front show? Yeah, anyhow I have been corresponding with him in an effort to help and now have an email and myspace address for you, it should be easy to pull an IP address from that should you want to press charges. You could at least maybe get your ipod back since he apparently stole that after he stomped on you and stomped your iphone.&lt;br /&gt;Just contact me on here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, some time ago, none other than fixed-gear freestyle impresario &lt;a href="http://prollyisnotprobably.com/"&gt;Prolly&lt;/a&gt; came upon &lt;a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3210/3043600257_e91e22d968_o.jpg"&gt;this highly dramatic and incendiary Craigslist Missed Connection&lt;/a&gt;, which is either very comical or somewhat disturbing, depending on your disposition. At the time, I dismissed it as fantasy, thinking it read too much like the hipser-hater's equivalent of a &lt;em&gt;Penthouse Forum&lt;/em&gt; letter. However, it would appear that at least one concerned citizen with hipster sympathies not only believes the story is true but has taken it upon himself to bring the driver to justice. I'm not sure what recourse the victim would actually have if they did find the guy, but if there's a rematch I really, really hope I'm invited to watch. I also hope there's a Zune involved this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once the private bike detective is done with that, he can move on to trailing adulterous husbands. After reading about the iPhone crusher, I noticed this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0toSWWkNI/AAAAAAAAD94/ewljv_H7V78/s1600-h/Linda+At+Bike+Junkie+Bike+Shop+-+m4w.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277424508491698386" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 70px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0toSWWkNI/AAAAAAAAD94/ewljv_H7V78/s400/Linda+At+Bike+Junkie+Bike+Shop+-+m4w.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/mis/940412715.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda At Bike Junkie Bike Shop - m4w - 54&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Bethpage)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-12-01, 11:45AM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fairly regular customer and I was in the store most recently twice a couple of weeks ago.

Because I am married I am uncomfortable approaching you directly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure Linda at Bike Junkie is pleased to know that his reticence isn't due to insecurity or lack of attraction--it's simply because he's trying to cheat on his wife. Next time this guy tells his wife he's "going out to buy tubes" at 12:45am she can have the bike dick follow him and build herself a solid divorce case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, speaking of following people, I always like to follow up on people I've mentioned here on the site. You may remember &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/shades-of-marketing-art-of-salesmanship.html"&gt;Shane Stock, owner of Oso Bike&lt;/a&gt;. Well, not only did he &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/gender-politics-sex-bikes-and.html"&gt;reinvent his corporate image by re-editing his video&lt;/a&gt;, but he also &lt;a href="http://www.bikecommuters.com/2008/11/13/oso-bike-first-impressions/"&gt;scored a review on Bikecommuters.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0xBcT6e2I/AAAAAAAAD-I/3oZpWSG_cQ0/s1600-h/OSO+Bike_+First+Impressions++Bike+Commuters.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5277428239197436770" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 345px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/ST0xBcT6e2I/AAAAAAAAD-I/3oZpWSG_cQ0/s400/OSO+Bike_+First+Impressions+%7C+Bike+Commuters.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not one to fuss over chainline, but I was dismayed to learn that the chainline of the Oso bike is something like a centimeter out-of-plane. Still, I suppose it makes a better sacrificial lamb than a Nagasawa or a Samson. (I understand NJS certification for the Oso is pending.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also feel compelled to apprise you of the latest from Opinionated Cyclist (if only to save you the trouble of watching his videos) since it may interest some of you to know he seems to have reinvented himself as a karaoke air musician.

(Or, as he's referred to by non-cycling Americans, "The guy from all the bike riding.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk76JN4lSI/AAAAAAAAD8w/EgcdW5OjQE4/s1600-h/twitter+shoutout.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276314308533851426" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 133px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk76JN4lSI/AAAAAAAAD8w/EgcdW5OjQE4/s400/twitter+shoutout.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While I appreciated the nod, I'm also the sort of person who can extract negativity from anything. (Hand me a suitcase full of money and I'll complain about how heavy it is. "You expect me to schlep this all the way to the bank?!?") If you're unfamiliar with Twitter, it only allows for entries of 140 letters or less, so it strikes me as odd that, with words at such a premium, Armstrong should still feel the need to squander them with use of the word "Maybe." Also, after he mentioned me, I checked back and was dismayed to find this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk71ACmfOI/AAAAAAAAD8o/xJwx69XuTz0/s1600-h/twitter+rapha.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276314220171263202" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 133px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk71ACmfOI/AAAAAAAAD8o/xJwx69XuTz0/s400/twitter+rapha.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If Armstrong can't even tell a serious site from a comedic one, does it really mean anything that he thinks mine is funny? Talk about damning with faint praise! Sure, Rapha did kill with that "&lt;a href="http://rapha.cc/index.php?page=539"&gt;tweed softshell&lt;/a&gt;" bit, but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, this didn't prevent me from enjoying his Twitter feed. It's rare that you get so much insight into the life of a public figure, and he should be applauded for his candor. I mean, he even tells you when the drug testers come--which is pretty often. Actually, at this point Armstrong just urinates involuntarily whenever the doorbell rings. (It's a great way to embarrass him at parties.) I was also surprised at how similar his life is to mine, as you can see from this entry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7vr4UDLI/AAAAAAAAD8g/-LcB4Z3PMyE/s1600-h/Twitter+_+lancearmstrong.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276314128860056754" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 205px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7vr4UDLI/AAAAAAAAD8g/-LcB4Z3PMyE/s400/Twitter+_+lancearmstrong.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; "Getting a massage from Ryszard (my longtime Polish soigneur) listening to Sufjan Stevens."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;so wild&lt;/em&gt;! I also have a longtime Polish soigneur, and I &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; crank up the Sufjan when he massages me. (My soigneur's name is Thadeusz, though. He has the hands of an angel--or at least the hands of an angel who has &lt;a href="http://www.hormelfoods.com/ASSETS/95C5CC83D3C94FA7A94B5709A54FFA59/Cure-81.jpg"&gt;Hormel hams&lt;/a&gt; for hands.) Get out of my head, Armstrong. Get out of my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, yesterday's post included &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgW7lf_1OI/AAAAAAAAD7A/trViKZ5aCxo/s1600-h/madonna+road+bike.jpg"&gt;a photo of Madonna on a road bike like 20 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and since then speculation as to the identity of her training partner has run rampant. (And by "run rampant" I of course mean that one or two people wondered who it is.) Well, one reader in Canada (or "Canadia" if you prefer) postulates that it may be none other than "Canadian Track Great Curt Harnett," based on this revealing photo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7p2uRNSI/AAAAAAAAD8Y/N0V0EoI5u9Q/s1600-h/madonna+partner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276314028691502370" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 200px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7p2uRNSI/AAAAAAAAD8Y/N0V0EoI5u9Q/s400/madonna+partner.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Well, the hair is certainly a match, and the reader points out that both riders are sporting Canadian national team colors on their shorts, but the cyclist with Madonna has the spindly legs of a pure climber and not the bulky legs of a trackie. I guess we may never know. Then again, that photo is pretty old, so if by some chance they spawned it may be worth watching the velodromes of the Great White North for any up-and-coming track racers with a penchant for both mullets and g-strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as much as I'd like to avoid reality by obsessing over the sexual dalliances of celebrities, the fact is there are much more serious matters in the world of cycling that need to be addressed, and I for one cannot in good conscience sit idly by. I received a shocking email recently in which a reader told a tragic tale of arriving at a bike rack designed to accommodate multiple bikes, only to find that a greedy rider had taken up the whole thing with one single wretched Huffy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7lsV__uI/AAAAAAAAD8Q/0MSWohhPySo/s1600-h/rack+hog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276313957185879778" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7lsV__uI/AAAAAAAAD8Q/0MSWohhPySo/s400/rack+hog.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I've taking the liberty of annotating the reader's photo, in which irony abounds. We've often seen expensive bikes locked up poorly, yet here is a bicycle that arguably nobody in his or her right mind would covet that has been secured with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; U-locks. The rider has even made sure to lock up both wheels, much to the chagrin of anybody looking for a steel-rimmed Schraeder valve wheelset with a gigantic pie plate. I'm guessing the only reason the highly-desireable comfort saddle isn't locked up too is that the seatpost became permanently stuck in the frame way back when Madonna used to ride (with) Curt Harnett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'd just like to take this opportunity to say that we, as a community of cyclists, should &lt;em&gt;not tolerate the craven act of bike rack-hogging&lt;/em&gt;. (Or bike rock-hagging, which is what Curt Harnett was doing with Madonna.) Nor should we tolerate the stupid act of failing to lock your bike altogether:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7h4AzRZI/AAAAAAAAD8I/ing4VKP3g_0/s1600-h/sirrus+lock.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276313891598714258" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7h4AzRZI/AAAAAAAAD8I/ing4VKP3g_0/s400/sirrus+lock.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And, perhaps most importantly, we need to take a strong stand against leaving frame size stickers on seat tubes. This is the bicycle equivalent of letting the tag stick up out of the collar of your t-shirt. Nobody cares what size your BILF t-shirt is, and nobody cares what size bike you ride. This particular example is especially disconcerting, because the rider has actually gone throught the trouble of adding &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; stickers, yet still couldn't even be bothered to remove the size sticker. And that's like standing there with your fly open and straightening your tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is some justice in the world, as evidenced by the apprehension of Dustin Dunlavy, the &lt;a href="http://www.madison.com/wsj/topstories/317175"&gt;idiot who's all touchy about lights&lt;/a&gt;. One intrepid reader even went so far as to unearth &lt;a href="http://www.athlinks.com/myresults.aspx?rid=28478526"&gt;Dunlavy's results from a few dorkathlons&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7cqBbDAI/AAAAAAAAD8A/7FeI-4dMfH0/s1600-h/DUSTIN+DUNLAVY_s+Race+Results+at+Athlinks.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276313801943878658" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 147px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7cqBbDAI/AAAAAAAAD8A/7FeI-4dMfH0/s400/DUSTIN+DUNLAVY_s+Race+Results+at+Athlinks.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumor has it that Dunlavy has already been approached by Michael Ball, who has apparently offered him a spot on Rock Racing's 2009 roster. Ball wouldn't confirm or deny this, though he did acknowledge that "Dunlavy has the agressive attitude and the extensive &lt;em&gt;palmolives&lt;/em&gt; we look for in a rider." I would have pressed him further, but the egg timer he uses to limit the duration of his interviews popped and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the p-far trend has officially moved into its "being sold at exorbitant prices on Craigslist" phase, as you can see from &lt;a href="http://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/bik/945165496.html"&gt;this listing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7NRkbHNI/AAAAAAAAD7o/JHiimqVVA0E/s1600-h/1888+Columbia+High+Wheel+Penny+Farthing+Bicycle+-+Original+Condition.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276313537681759442" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 53px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk7NRkbHNI/AAAAAAAAD7o/JHiimqVVA0E/s400/1888+Columbia+High+Wheel+Penny+Farthing+Bicycle+-+Original+Condition.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1888 Columbia High Wheel Penny Farthing Bicycle - Original Condition - $8000&lt;/strong&gt; (carlsbad)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Date: 2008-12-04, 1:50PM PST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1888 Columbia Light Roadster Highwheel high wheel penny farthing bicycle.

Still, it's a fine ride, and it even appears to have an integrated headset. (At least I don't see any headset cups.) Personally, the first thing I'd do is remove the brake, which is that thing on the front that looks like a shoehorn. I wouldn't want some gentleman to question my mettle, lest I be forced to challenge him to a duel. (In which case I'd slap him with my &lt;a href="http://www.velonews.com/article/84969/knog-love-hate-gloves"&gt;Knog love/hate glove&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your tastes run more toward the modern, you doubtless covet this new-school ride, spotted by a reader in Des Moines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk6z7Jwo8I/AAAAAAAAD7Y/pXc9wneLQV4/s1600-h/antique.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276313102167614402" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk6z7Jwo8I/AAAAAAAAD7Y/pXc9wneLQV4/s400/antique.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm especially "feeling" the lantern on the front. If Dustin Dunlavy had had a light like that, the whole unfortunate incident would have been averted. Also, if Knog Frogs are &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/09/frog-in-throat-diagnosing-your-bicycle.html"&gt;hipster cysts&lt;/a&gt;, then this bike has a serious case of "dandy rheumatism."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as trendy as the old-fashioned rides are, it's important to keep looking towards the future. And no company is more forward-looking than BMC. One reader even forwarded me this photo of a BMC p-far prototype:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk6t9vWjtI/AAAAAAAAD7Q/z3D-0dx4jtE/s1600-h/penny_bmc.jpg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276312999782944466" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 257px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk6t9vWjtI/AAAAAAAAD7Q/z3D-0dx4jtE/s400/penny_bmc.jpg.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; a chick magnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ride safe this weekend,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--BSNYC/RTMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/5315241725218786610/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=5315241725218786610' title='179 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/5315241725218786610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/5315241725218786610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/extra-ordinary-from-publicity-to-p-fars.html' title='Extra-Ordinary: From Publicity to P-Fars'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STk76JN4lSI/AAAAAAAAD8w/EgcdW5OjQE4/s72-c/twitter+shoutout.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>179</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-5436213293088495157</id><published>2008-12-04T08:29:00.028-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-08T18:49:27.678-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cycling clothing'/><title type='text'>Lookin' Good: Holiday Cycling Fashions</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgGTYOrlzI/AAAAAAAAD5w/SE24MwBd0-c/s1600-h/cbgb+windbreaker.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275973893455845170" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 237px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgGTYOrlzI/AAAAAAAAD5w/SE24MwBd0-c/s400/cbgb+windbreaker.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(CBGB: from storied rock club to sportswear line)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style=" ;font-size:16px;"&gt;Further to yesterday's post in which I mentioned the attack in Wisconsin, I did not realize when I went to press that &lt;a href="http://www.madison.com/wsj/mad/top/316889"&gt;the victim was actually the owner of a high-end bike shop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STfb1cJereI/AAAAAAAAD5I/LxgNGLbZrDY/s1600-h/WISCONSIN+STATE+JOURNAL.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275927199623327202" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 309px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 133px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STfb1cJereI/AAAAAAAAD5I/LxgNGLbZrDY/s400/WISCONSIN+STATE+JOURNAL.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This puts a whole new spin on the incident, and while I don't believe in telling strangers what to do, in this case O'Brien's advice to "Get a light" was probably warranted. First of all, as a respected figure in cycling who was even &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/health/nutrition/20fitness.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;quoted in the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/health/nutrition/20fitness.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; just two weeks ago, I'd argue that O'Brien is entitled to give other riders pointers on the fly. After all, people pay him hundreds of dollars for bike fits, so the Fred on the Trek should have been grateful for the free advice. That's like bumping into a dentist on the subway who takes a quick look at your molar and saves you the time and money of making an appointment. Secondly, in these trying economic times, you really can't blame a shop owner for trying to drum up business. O'Brien's utterance of "Get a light" may not have been an admonition at all. Rather, he might be having a big sale at his shop, and he simply identified the one item the riders didn't have and as such might be most interested in buying. Had Fred and Wilma simply listened instead of flying into a rage, they might have heard the rest of the sentence: "Get a light--50% off this week only at Chronometro!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(UPDATE: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/317158"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assailant has been apprehended&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of big, big savings, it's that time of year, and as such various periodicals are publishing their holiday gift guides. A reader informs me that &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;, the Ryan Seacrest of newspapers, &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/2008-12-02-holiday-gift-guide_N.htm"&gt;has even produced one for bike commuters&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to such items as a $70 Ralpha t-shirt and a $500 Castelli jacket, they also suggest a Rock Racing t-shirt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STf-mRws3pI/AAAAAAAAD5o/pAKCA3yiepE/s1600-h/rock+racing+t.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275965422043979410" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 159px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STf-mRws3pI/AAAAAAAAD5o/pAKCA3yiepE/s400/rock+racing+t.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Rock Racing T-Shirt&lt;/strong&gt; ($15 and up, shop.rockracing.com) shows the world that you back the iconoclastic bike racing team owned by Rock &amp;amp; Republic fashion mogul Michael Ball. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; a gift. In fact, I was so excited by it that you'll notice I tagged it with the BSNYC/RTMS Pleasantly Surprised Holiday Gift Lady, a distinction reserved for only the best presents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STf9CWlYEKI/AAAAAAAAD5g/VSrpHFDIuXQ/s1600-h/surprised+lady.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275963705351737506" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 79px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 96px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STf9CWlYEKI/AAAAAAAAD5g/VSrpHFDIuXQ/s400/surprised+lady.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who wouldn't want to back fashion mogul Michael Ball and his iconoclastic bike racing team? After all, the King of Pants is as generous as he is iconoclastic--so much so that he's recently been granting "10-minute Q&amp;amp;A sessions with select publications," such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-3-9-18194-1,00.html?cm_mmc=BicyclingNL-_-2008_12_04-_-news-_-10_minutes_with_michael_ball"&gt;Bicycling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://pezcyclingnews.com/?pg=fullstory&amp;amp;id=6514"&gt;Pez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Actually, Pez managed to get 15 minutes, and the drama and excitement that surround a brush with Ball is palpable in the intro to the interview:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BlackBerry alarm rings at 05.30 and the red light is flashing; I've got mail - it's from Rock Racing's Sean Weide. "I can get you 15 minutes with Michael Ball - as one of only five media representatives who will be interviewing him tomorrow. He can talk about Rudy, the 2009 roster, Tyler, etc." Wow! Let's see what Mr. Ball had to say.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must admit that Ball's considerable savvy is clearly in evidence here. It's very hard to get noticed in the world of fashion, where Ball is overshadowed by vastly more successful and douchey characters like Marc Jacobs. So wisely, Ball bought his way into the much smaller and quieter world of domestic pro cycling, where people actually think he's a "mogul," where having a few Cadillacs seems impossibly lavish, and where he can be stingy with his time when dealing with the very media on whom his team's livelihood depends. (I'd like to see Ball try his "I can get you 15 minutes" tactic with &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;Women's Wear Daily&lt;/em&gt;. "15 minutes with &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;?")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say Ball doesn't deserve respect for sponsoring a cycling team, or for winning the Stars and Stripes jersey, or for employing some young riders. It would just be nice if it didn't all come with so much ego, hair product, and general smarm. But hey, if Ball needs to grease the wheels of cycling with his own unctuousness to make things happen, then so be it. (Plus, I already had my face time with Ball, when &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SFXfFXq_p9I/AAAAAAAACdE/Ugc1Z41kMO0/s1600-h/mj+hat.jpg"&gt;I got his autograph&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;At any rate, let's say you're looking to buy someone a t-shirt for the holidays but the person you're shopping for doesn't back the iconoclastic bike racing team owned by Rock &amp;amp; Republic fashion mogul Michael Ball. Well, in that case, you can always get them&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/BILF-T-Shirt-Fixed-Gear-Track-Bike-Bicycle-Fixie_W0QQitemZ170282938610QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item170282938610&amp;amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;amp;_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A1%7C293%3A2%7C294%3A50"&gt; a BILF t-shirt on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which I was alerted to by a reader:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgHV728XoI/AAAAAAAAD54/szm7ZDvA8F4/s1600-h/bilf+t.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275975036891324034" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 299px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgHV728XoI/AAAAAAAAD54/szm7ZDvA8F4/s400/bilf+t.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Bicycle I'd Like to F**K American Apparel T-Shirt.

"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;There's certainly no question this t-shirt warrants a carefully-placed BSNYC/RTMS Pleasantly Surprised Holiday Gift Lady:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgHxrAgzcI/AAAAAAAAD6A/7U5gCAgCx9Q/s1600-h/bilf+t+surprised.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275975513404394946" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 299px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgHxrAgzcI/AAAAAAAAD6A/7U5gCAgCx9Q/s400/bilf+t+surprised.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Personally, I think it's strange to want to have sex with a bicycle. If it's simply a question of wanting to have sex with things that are thin and cold, you can always go trolling for models in the nightclubs of LA with Michael Ball instead. But I suppose I'm in the minority when it comes to my aversion to velophilia, because the demand for BILF t-shirts is so high that &lt;a href="http://velotees.com/proddetail.php?prod=BILF"&gt;another company is making them as well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgKoCAKZiI/AAAAAAAAD6I/f3IUYCGsD-U/s1600-h/bilf+t+2.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275978646313133602" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 380px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 355px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgKoCAKZiI/AAAAAAAAD6I/f3IUYCGsD-U/s400/bilf+t+2.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You'd have to be a real pervert to wear this one, though, since it means you're sexually attracted to left-hand chainring bikes on which the chain inexplicably passes through the rear triangle and drives a right-hand cog. Also, the bike either has front and rear pie plates or extremely high-flange hubs. The only "sensible" thing here is the bar height, which is level with the saddle and which Grant Petersen would doubtless find highly titillating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, the same company will also sell you plenty of other extremely witty and irreverent shirts, such as: &lt;a href="http://www.velotees.com/proddetail.php?prod=Top_10"&gt;the "10 Reasons Why My Bike Is Better Than My Girl" shirt&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.velotees.com/proddetail.php?prod=DS_Team_MILF"&gt;the "Team MILF/Director Sportif" shirt&lt;/a&gt; (which I may order for Michael Ball); and of course &lt;a href="http://www.velotees.com/proddetail.php?prod=Wheelsucker"&gt;the hysterically funny "I'm With Wheelsucker" shirt&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgOp8X_YJI/AAAAAAAAD6Q/F5ohMn4ZclA/s1600-h/Green_Wheelsucker_380x351.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275983077208711314" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 380px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 351px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgOp8X_YJI/AAAAAAAAD6Q/F5ohMn4ZclA/s400/Green_Wheelsucker_380x351.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See that? It has a picture of two cyclists on it, with an arrow pointing to the wheelsucker. The people at Velotees don't miss a beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's more to cycling gifts than t-shirts and Rapha stuff--even if it's &lt;a href="http://www.velodramatic.com/"&gt;30 days of Rapha&lt;/a&gt;, which would cost you approximately $96,000 and is kind of like going on a Dom Perignon bender. This Ralpha jacket alone &lt;a href="http://www.rapha.cc/index.php?page=539"&gt;goes for $750&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgSW7UlpSI/AAAAAAAAD6Y/i5HxksuXF_M/s1600-h/rapha+tweed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275987148555003170" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 266px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgSW7UlpSI/AAAAAAAAD6Y/i5HxksuXF_M/s400/rapha+tweed.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's a lot to pay for a garment which is just a pretentious version of the Michael Jackson "Beat It" jacket:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgTqJFNXLI/AAAAAAAAD6g/mREQIoh8BFo/s1600-h/beat+it.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275988578177735858" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 302px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgTqJFNXLI/AAAAAAAAD6g/mREQIoh8BFo/s400/beat+it.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a fashion mogul to see that they copied it right down to the shoulder panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Rapha may be the first name in ultra-luxury cycling apparel, but &lt;a href="http://www.cadenceclothing.net/"&gt;Cadence&lt;/a&gt; is right on their heels.  &lt;a href="http://www.cadenceclothing.net/"&gt;Cadence's winter collection&lt;/a&gt; is nothing short of remarkable, in that it takes garments that are impractical for cycling and adds little flourishes which are supposed to make them functional but instead just make them complicated.  Take this scarf:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgVzKEHK_I/AAAAAAAAD6o/W1z14JwRTaI/s1600-h/cadence+formel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275990932083649522" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgVzKEHK_I/AAAAAAAAD6o/W1z14JwRTaI/s400/cadence+formel.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I don't understand the scarf as a cycling garment, mainly because they flap around in the wind.  There are also other ways to keep your neck and chest warm on the bike that don't make your head feel like an egg in a loose nest of billowy fabric.  I suppose Cadence are attempting to ameliorate the flap factor by putting a little slot in it so you can cinch it, but in doing so they seem to have also limited the ways in which you can wear the scarf and maximize its effectiveness.  In any case, ineffectual scarfs are &lt;a href="http://www.smaggle.com/2008/03/01/how-to-wear-a-scarf-for-men/"&gt;an essential component of the "hipster" wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, so I suppose this sort of thing is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgV_M2lUVI/AAAAAAAAD6w/QAsWl11H7MM/s1600-h/cadence+hoodie.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275991138990641490" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgV_M2lUVI/AAAAAAAAD6w/QAsWl11H7MM/s400/cadence+hoodie.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; How do you make an item that's not particularly good at keeping you warm a little bit warmer?  You add a superfluous dickey type thing.  That way your American Spirit-ravaged larynx will stay slightly warmer than your chest.  Brilliant, and perfect for when the mercury dips below 65 degrees. (Brrr!)  I wonder if it's compatible with the scarf?  I don't see any slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgX_PHF_II/AAAAAAAAD7I/5SFJiDMzQp4/s1600-h/cadence+arm+warmers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275993338620017794" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STgX_PHF_II/AAAAAAAAD7I/5SFJiDMzQp4/s400/cadence+arm+warmers.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My favorite garment by far though is the arm warmer with thumby slot.  (This winter it's all about the slot.)  I like it so much I gave it a BSNYC/RTMS Pleasantly Surprised Holiday Gift Lady.  The advantage of this design is that it keeps the top of your hand warm while leaving your fingers exposed to the elements and making it inconvenient to wear gloves--perfect for maintaining knuckle tattoo visibility on slightly chilly days.  The only thing that would make this better would be if Cadence also sold little individual wool finger cots so you could warm your digits on those rare occasions when knuckle tattoo visibility isn't essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, like Rapha, Cadence also seem to be mining 80s pop culture, because I could imagine Madonna wearing some of this stuff during the "Like A Virgin" era.  (I think the arm warmer would look great with lots of those black rubber bracelets.)

Take the cyclist I shared the bridge to Manhattan with this morning. As I ascended, I was overtaken by a rider on a color-coordinated track bike which was as free from dirt as it was from brakes. He passed me handily and I thought nothing of it, thinking that was the last I'd see of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;But then came the descent, and the drawbridge-being-raised sound of reverse torque on a fixed-gear drivetrain. There's a sharp right hand turn at the bottom of the bridge on the Manhattan side. If you've got brakes it's no big deal and you don't even have to think about slowing until you're right on top of it, but if you're brakeless you have to begin the process of slowing as soon as you begin your descent lest you come into it too hot and wind up splattered on the side of a Fung Wah bus. Needless to say, I soon found myself stuck behind this guy. And if you commute in New York City or any place brakelessness is rampant, you know what came next: the skip-stops. &lt;em&gt;Pedalpedalpedal, skidskidskid. Pedalpedalpedal, skidskidskid.&lt;/em&gt; As he gingerly picked his way down like a mule descending a rocky trail, I passed the minutes by feathering my brakes and marveling over their efficacy; first the front, then the rear, then both together. Then I used my levers to tap out "You're an idiot" in Morse code, but I don't think he noticed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The reason I was so upset is that New York City's pretty flat, and when it comes to commuting I'm pretty lazy. The bridge descent is one of the few places where I can actually go fast without exerting myself. To be robbed of that opportunity because of someone's fashion choice is extremely irritating--it's like paying to go see a movie and then sitting behind someone who insists on wearing a giant tri-cornered hat. (I always take mine off unless I'm sitting in the very last row.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while I may have been upset, I didn't go so far as to actually &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; something to him. First of all, the hairy-chested gigolo that is annoyance swings both ways, and I very well may have been just as annoying to him. As he passed me on the ascent, I'm sure he was disgusted by my lazy pace, and my non-messenger bag, and my superfluous brakes, and my ostentatious taped bars with their giant levers and multiple bends. "How many hand positions does this idiot need?", he probably asked himself. "He's got more places to put his mitts than a serial groper on a Tokyo subway." And on the way down, he probably cursed us crazy braked riders and our reckless high-speed descents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second reason I didn't say anything was that it might have been dangerous. Yesterday a number of people emailed me the following horrific article from the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/35376494.html"&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaMgB9bARI/AAAAAAAAD4Q/I0VKry16jUI/s1600-h/Bicyclist+beaten+after+telling+other+riders+to+get+lights+-+JSOnline.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275558495420875026" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 309px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaMgB9bARI/AAAAAAAAD4Q/I0VKry16jUI/s400/Bicyclist+beaten+after+telling+other+riders+to+get+lights+-+JSOnline.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;[excerpt]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;The man told police he was riding on South Shore Drive when he heard someone from behind tell him that he would be passing on the left. He moved over and a man and a woman rode past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they did, however, he said, "Get a light." The other man turned and asked what he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim repeated, "Get a light."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couple yelled loudly at the man, telling him to mind his own business, according to police. The victim said the other man attempted to run him off the road before the couple followed him to his home driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's where a conversation about lights continued and the woman told the victim that he seemed to have plenty of lights and asked for one. He gave her a light and told police he did not feel threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other man, however, appeared to still be upset about the original comment and allegedly clamped his hands around the victim's head. The other man then twisted the victim to the ground and kneed him in the ribs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first suspect was described as a white male, about 6 feet tall, wearing a dark-colored jacket and riding a Trek time trial bike .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second suspect was a white female, about 5-feet-4-inches who rode an Orbea road bike with orange on the front.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This report of unwarranted violence shook me to my core, and I can only hope these rampaging roadies are brought to justice. I must say though that I can't imagine a dorkier pair of assailants--even in Wisconsin. To be attacked by some Fred on a Trek TT bike while his Orbea-straddling Wilma looks on is an indignity nobody should ever have to experience. I wish the article gave more of a description, because I'd very much like to know what they were wearing. Given the savage nature of the attack and the goofy bikes I'm pretty sure &lt;a href="http://www.primalwear.com/"&gt;Primal Wear&lt;/a&gt; was involved. The man was probably sporting this inexcusably hideous Metallica "...And Justice For All" jersey (you don't "rock" or "run" Primal Wear; you "sport" it, like Dockers or Rockports):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STav8okC_XI/AAAAAAAAD4o/ahmFzs5b8aU/s1600-h/and+justice+for+all+jersey.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275597469726735730" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 250px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 250px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STav8okC_XI/AAAAAAAAD4o/ahmFzs5b8aU/s400/and+justice+for+all+jersey.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While his lady partner, who's clearly in denial over the disaster her life has become, had most likely attired herself in the Queen of DeNile chemise:&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275598395256065362" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STawygbbzVI/AAAAAAAAD4w/5A90xlXg5Rk/s400/denile.gif" border="0" /&gt;I'd also be willing to bet good money (and by "good money" I mean Euros) that at least one of them was wearing one of those inexcusable roadie babuskas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275602519976319554" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STa0imNYGkI/AAAAAAAAD44/p7UKcr6eTAg/s400/schmata.jpg" border="0" /&gt;The roadie babuska is the cycling equivalent of sporting a Members Only jacket with no shirt underneath, and you should never, ever wear one, no matter how much pate-wicking you may think you need. Then again, you also probably shouldn't tell people you don't know to "get a light," or to "wear a helmet," or to "get a brake." While all of these things are good advice, and while it's perfectly fine to endorse them, it's almost always best to refrain from doing so directly to other riders &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;. This is not to excuse Fred and Wilma's wanton behavior by any means, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; really annoying. Even though I believe with every molecule in my body that you should never wear a roadie babushka, I wouldn't approach a stranger and tell him he should take that sweaty disgusting dishrag off his head. And even though I wanted to tell the guy on the bridge to "get a brake," I knew it would have been foolish to do so. Being annoyed by brakeless riders is curmudgeonly; telling off brakeless riders on the street is just pain douchey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of roadies and douches, I noticed during my recess that &lt;a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2008/nov08/nov26news2"&gt;Franck Vandenbroucke is on yet another team&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaON2s85dI/AAAAAAAAD4g/lRQmUBCYjcY/s1600-h/vandenbroucke.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275560382184613330" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 97px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaON2s85dI/AAAAAAAAD4g/lRQmUBCYjcY/s400/vandenbroucke.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franck Vandenbroucke is the Mavic Ksyrium freehub of professional cyclists in that both are constantly squealing and failing, yet people continue to invest money in them for some reason. You'd think after the famous "those drugs were for my dog" incident (which was, admittedly, sublime in its absurdity) cycling would have closed the door on Vandenbroucke once and for all, and that people would realize by now that he's long gone from &lt;em&gt;enfant terrible&lt;/em&gt; to plain infant. But you'd be wrong. You'd also think people would have realized he looks uncannily like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P5qJAI9BIc"&gt;Ruprecht from "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"&lt;/a&gt; but to my knowledge this has yet to be acknowledged by the cycling press:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STa92Hx9bTI/AAAAAAAAD5A/0OmW4L5OPAM/s1600-h/vandenruprect.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275612751010295090" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 178px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 98px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STa92Hx9bTI/AAAAAAAAD5A/0OmW4L5OPAM/s400/vandenruprect.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed, failed promise is addicting. Despite being a failure whose &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vandenbroucke_(cyclist)"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; reads like the treatment for a John C. Reilly movie, cycling fans &lt;a href="http://www.belgiumkneewarmers.com/2006/12/pro-with-capital-o.html"&gt;wax nostalgic about the fact he won Leige-Bastogne-Leige like ten years ago or something, and that he cocked his handlebars at a jaunty angle&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because he's a "natural talent." ( "Everybody did it, and so did I," he said about doping. "It is the truth and it does not diminish the value of my victories.") I suppose this makes sense though. We all know the real villains in professional road cycling are the ones with the audacity to to win a bunch of races, stay out of trouble, and be successful. And that's not what bike racing is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, I suppose there's nothing wrong with recycling. The professional road racing world is still trying to recycle Vandenbroucke, and the fixed-gear world is still trying to recycle front wheels. We've already seen them breathe new life into the Spinergy Rev-X and the Aerospoke, and &lt;a href="http://hkfixed.blogspot.com/2008/09/wheelchair-front-wheel.html"&gt;now they're moving on to the wheelchair wheel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaNvPTl02I/AAAAAAAAD4Y/KKrqZZGZ5EA/s1600-h/wheelchair+front+wheel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275559856213185378" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 325px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaNvPTl02I/AAAAAAAAD4Y/KKrqZZGZ5EA/s400/wheelchair+front+wheel.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you're a competitive wheelchair athlete who's upgraded to a &lt;a href="http://www.zipp.com/wheels/detail.php?ID=29"&gt;Zipp&lt;/a&gt; or something, you'll be happy to know there's a burgeoning market for your old take-offs.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/298572125873599719/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=298572125873599719' title='111 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/298572125873599719'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/298572125873599719'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/bite-your-tongue-roadie-rage-and-how-to.html' title='Bite Your Tongue: Roadie Rage, and How to Avoid It'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STaMgB9bARI/AAAAAAAAD4Q/I0VKry16jUI/s72-c/Bicyclist+beaten+after+telling+other+riders+to+get+lights+-+JSOnline.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>111</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-3666889630905274935</id><published>2008-12-02T09:11:00.023-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-02T20:07:04.563-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cycling in nyc'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='bicycle marketing'/><title type='text'>Owning Your Bike:  All You Haters Hold the Mayo</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVr7z9y1cI/AAAAAAAAD4I/3ZN0EOuU2Lk/s1600-h/change.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275241213840250306" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVr7z9y1cI/AAAAAAAAD4I/3ZN0EOuU2Lk/s400/change.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"&gt; (Manhattan storefront)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;People don't like me. I'm not sure why this is, but I know it's true. &lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SOORggejSgI/AAAAAAAADOo/1HeocyOr1lM/s1600-h/nonplussed+tryptich.JPG"&gt;I can see it in their eyes&lt;/a&gt;. Take this very morning, for instance. I was riding through downtown Manhattan, on a relatively quiet street, in a relatively empty bike lane, and to the best of my knowledge I was in compliance with every single local traffic law. (As far as I know there's no law against cycling in stockings and heels, even in December.) As I rode, I noticed that there was a pedestrian walking towards me carrying a bag full of take-out, right in the middle of the bike lane.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in New York City, when the sidewalks are choked with humanity, a few errant souls will stray into the bike lane. It's almost unavoidable. In this case though there was plenty of room on the sidewalk--in fact it could just as easily have been a sidewalk on Main Street in Anytown, USA. (The sidewalks on Main Street in Anytown, USA are pretty empty now because of the economy.) Finally, he looked up at me, and I shrugged and pointed to the sidewalk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Shut up," he said to me disgustedly. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was shocked, and I don't shock easily. (Except when I drag my high heels along my shag carpet and then touch the doornob.) Firstly, I hadn't uttered a word, so I don't know why the "shut up" was even warranted. Secondly, try as I might, I could think of no good reason for why he would choose to walk in the street instead of on the sidewalk (which as I said was free from crowds) where his chances of being run down by a cyclist or motorist were significantly less. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="center"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just so happens that this was one of those &lt;a href="http://www.bikedenver.org/wp-content/uploads/photos/times2.jpg"&gt;bright green bike lanes&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought that perhaps he just has a compulsion to walk on green surfaces. Maybe he's got a house full of green carpeting, and this makes him feel at home. Or maybe he pines for Anytown, USA and mistook the bike lane for grass. Eventually, though, I ruled these out, and decided it was because he, like everybody else, simply hates me on sight. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "You couldn't possibly be that objectionable. He just didn't like you because you were on a bike." Well, I don't buy that. Plenty of other people who ride bikes are popular. Moreover, people on bikes don't like me either. A reader recently confirmed this to me when he forwarded me a link to the "Cyclist Project," which is the work of a photographer called &lt;a href="http://www.marisabaz.com/"&gt;Marisabaz&lt;/a&gt;, and which you can peruse &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marisabaz/sets/72157607761506814/"&gt;on her Flickr page&lt;/a&gt;.

That's because he was a drug addict, and he was selling you a stolen bike in order to purchase more drugs. That would explain the scary eyes and $20 price tag. Welcome to New York City! I'm guessing you haven't been here long, because if you had: a) you would have realized that; and b) you would have held fast at $5. In a way though, it's sort of charming that one person's drug-addicted thief is another's Bike Fairy flitting about Williamsburg and selling cheap bikes. Did he look like &lt;a href="http://static.twoday.net/beingboring/images/maxwright.jpg"&gt;the dad from "Alf?"&lt;/a&gt; I heard he's been having hard times, and it's entirely possible he's moved into freelance bike retail. (By the way, don't blame "Alf" dad for the "curse." There's no such thing as a curse, but there is such a thing as a crappy bike.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naivetee notwithstanding, I like the "Cycling Project." In fact, I like it so much I went ahead and made my own entry based on &lt;a href="http://www.c2sexy.com/sophie-howard-rosie-jones-nue-noel-5325/sophie-howard-rosie-jones-5325-18/"&gt;this not-safe-for-work link&lt;/a&gt;, forwarded to me by a reader:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVCOFLpOwI/AAAAAAAAD3I/GUY-YJhSAN0/s1600-h/sophie+cyclist+project.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275195348211022594" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 271px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVCOFLpOwI/AAAAAAAAD3I/GUY-YJhSAN0/s400/sophie+cyclist+project.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I ride a bike because I have an ample bosom and people pay me to straddle them in my underpants!

No matter what you're straddling, keep the rubber side down.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;So if you're wondering how the big bike love-in that is the "Cycling Project" managed to remind me that people don't like me, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marisabaz/3033694412/in/set-72157607761506814/"&gt;here's your answer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275196861350552642" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 312px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVDmKEOJEI/AAAAAAAAD3Q/kSpnaA8ymEg/s400/cyclist+project+3.jpg" border="0" /&gt;As you may or may not know, way back in the middle of the summer &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/06/showtime-at-apollo-rock-racing-comes-to.html"&gt;I noticed this bike at the Harlem criterium and made an offhand remark&lt;/a&gt;. This upset the owner, so &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/06/too-much-irony-too-little-time-elusive.html"&gt;I attempted to explain myself&lt;/a&gt;. That, I had assumed, was that--until I saw that the owner is apparently still angry at me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;I mention this not to goad the owner, but only because I'm dismayed he's still angry and I want to assure him and the rest of cycledom that I have no designs on taking away anyone's "real bike joy." And perhaps worst of all, the anger he still feels towards me has contaminated what is otherwise a lovely project, so hopefully by reiterating my lack of malicious intent I can help air out any residual bitterness that still lays hidden in the folds of time. (As well as avoid any more clumsy metaphors.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;Of course, I shouldn't be surprised that he's still angry, since I did commit the unforgivable sin of Consumerist Political Incorrectness. In our culture, few acts are more sacred than that of the purchase. When you buy something, you're not just exchanging money for an item. You're actually performing a holy communion in which you become one with your possession and subsequently identify yourself with it, and as such your purchase speaks more loudly about you than your surname or your religion. It's no wonder then that people become upset when someone else implies they might not like or be impressed by something they've bought. When you're emotionally invested in your possessions an affront to them is also an affront to you. Thou shalt not disapprove of your neighbor's purchases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;For this reason, I endeavored to explore the Cult of BMC to learn what makes them special. To that end, I watched &lt;a href="http://www.bmc-racing.com/en/us/about-bmc/corporate-movie/"&gt;this video on their website&lt;/a&gt;. I must confess, I didn't learn much. The narrator just kept reminding me over and over again that the company is Swiss, which naturally means their bikes are built with precision. I'm not sure how much that means in 2008, since most of these bikes are now made in Taiwan anyway, and the only real difference between "Swiss precision" and "Italian soul" these days is that the guy who boxes up your bike in Switzerland shows up to work at 9:00, whereas the Italian guy shows up at 9:20-ish. Also, BMC design their bikes on computers (remember, precision), and they also command you to be unique: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVEO5b6iQI/AAAAAAAAD3o/HC03qjZ8JRo/s1600-h/BMC+swiss+cycling+technology+-%C3%83%E2%80%9A"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275197561261164802" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 229px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVEO5b6iQI/AAAAAAAAD3o/HC03qjZ8JRo/s400/BMC+swiss+cycling+technology+-%C2%A0Corporate+Movie.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Compulsory uniqueness aside, it's too bad computers can't feel pain, because if they could maybe they'd have told BMC's Swiss precision engineers that the top tube of their Cross Machine (&lt;a href="http://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=21220"&gt;over $3,000 for frame and fork&lt;/a&gt;) digs into your shoulder when you carry it. (Carrying your bike is an essential part of cyclocross.) In fact, the latest issue of &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://cxmagazine.com/"&gt;Cyclocross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; magazine says, "it creates a sharp underside for shouldering, quite opposite of the common practice of flattening the tube for comfort on run-ups," and that the "pointy shape was uncomfortable enough to make me consider going back to my early days of 'cross and using a woman's shoulder pad under my jersey." But while the computer couldn't feel the pain, it could tell the engineers that those t-section carbon nanotubes were ever so slightly stiffer than simple round tubes. Also, the computer told them it would cost them a whole lot more money to change the shape of the top tube on the 'cross frame than it would to simply use the same ones they use for the road bikes. And &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;that's&lt;/span&gt; precision you can feel--digging painfully into your collarbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even though I don't particularly care for BMC's bikes, the owner of the one above shouldn't really care. First of all, he's got a track frame, not a 'cross frame. Secondly, anybody can buy a bike, but not everybody can &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;own&lt;/span&gt; a bike. And when you &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;own&lt;/span&gt; your bike, you really don't care what anybody thinks of it. So &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;own&lt;/span&gt; that BMC, and I hope you rock and/or run it for years to come. (I think you "rock" a track bike when it's got risers, but you "run" it when it's got drops.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, the proprietor of &lt;a href="http://zlogblog.com/"&gt;Zlogblog&lt;/a&gt; has sent me the following photos, in which the heretofore mutually-exclusive worlds of unorthodox handlebars and u-locks have collided with enough force to forever change the landscape of fixed-gear cycling as we know it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVFURBOXjI/AAAAAAAAD3w/bprO4reK6cE/s1600-h/u-lock+bars+1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275198753002642994" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVFURBOXjI/AAAAAAAAD3w/bprO4reK6cE/s400/u-lock+bars+1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVFe5Cb-lI/AAAAAAAAD34/0D2rUa0_qBk/s1600-h/u+lock+bars+2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275198935543839314" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVFe5Cb-lI/AAAAAAAAD34/0D2rUa0_qBk/s400/u+lock+bars+2.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That's right, you no longer have to carry your u-lock in your oversized messenger bag, rear pant pocket, or holster. With this revolutionary technique, the lock is now an integral part of your ride! Not only does it afford you additional hand positions, but you don't even have to remove it to lock the bicycle. (Though of course your lock will now only be as effective as your allen bolts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, everybody knows that cutting-edge urban cyclists are now ditching locks altogether. &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/05/bsnyc-interview-great-nyc-commuter-race.html"&gt;Great Commuter Race champion Jamie Favaro&lt;/a&gt; has forwarded me &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arockdontstop/3063635225/"&gt;the following photo&lt;/a&gt;, which proves that disease is the new theft-deterrent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVGaM1Xg1I/AAAAAAAAD4A/GdBu0lxsAf0/s1600-h/if+you+try+to+steal.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275199954470011730" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVGaM1Xg1I/AAAAAAAAD4A/GdBu0lxsAf0/s400/if+you+try+to+steal.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unfortunately, though, this rider made a poor choice of diseases, since everybody also knows gratuitous insensitive AIDS references went out in like 1990 when &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_Row_(heavy_metal_band)"&gt;that idiot from Skid Row rocked that t-shirt&lt;/a&gt;. If you're going to try this, at least use a different disease. My personal choice is botulism, since my own Ironic Orange Julius Bike is generally slathered in spoiled mayonnaise anyway. (Even if the thief is wise to the fact that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayonnaise"&gt;it's only a misconception that spoiled mayonnaise causes food poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, funky mayo is still in itself a sufficient deterrent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if some guy with scary eyes who looks like the dad from "Alf" tries to sell you a bike covered in mayonnaise for $20, you can safely assume it's mine. Even though he's taken it from me, I still &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;own&lt;/span&gt; it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/3666889630905274935/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=3666889630905274935' title='86 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/3666889630905274935'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/3666889630905274935'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/owning-your-bike-all-you-haters-hold.html' title='Owning Your Bike:  All You Haters Hold the Mayo'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STVr7z9y1cI/AAAAAAAAD4I/3ZN0EOuU2Lk/s72-c/change.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>86</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-6048643559398040733</id><published>2008-12-01T09:55:00.009-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-01T15:03:12.111-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='campagnolo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='bicycle marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='road bikes'/><title type='text'>The Party's Over: Derailed by the Economy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STKpnAfQxOI/AAAAAAAAD0Y/46abutIqjlw/s1600-h/bronx+pawn+shop.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274464601215386850" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STKpnAfQxOI/AAAAAAAAD0Y/46abutIqjlw/s400/bronx+pawn+shop.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:x-small;"&gt;(Bronx pawn shop window)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things, as they say, are tough all over. Usually I try to ignore the the problems of the world, choosing instead to focus my concern on the world of cycling, and for the most part I've been successful. (While millions of people must live without food, clothing, or shelter, I find myself worrying more about the fact that thousands of fixed-gears are being ridden without bar tape, brakes, or foot retention.) However, the signs of collapse are everywhere, and even I can no longer ignore them.

It's one thing when people are losing their houses, but it's another when they're losing the very things that make life worth living, like giant purple limousines. As much as I longed to see &lt;a href="http://transalt.org/"&gt;Transportation Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; Executive Director Paul Steely White emerge with his microbrew-swilling entourage from this block-long purple party machine one last time (with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsCXZczTQXo"&gt;appropriate musical accompaniment&lt;/a&gt; of course), even I had to confront the fact that the party may very well be over--at least for the time being. With this awe-inspiring vehicle curbed and bound for auction, where it will most likely be snatched up by the premiere of some faraway post-Soviet republic, there's no question we are entering a new era of austerity and sobriety. For the next few years at least, sweet sixteens, proms, and weddings in the Brooklyn/Queens/Nassau area are about to get a little less magical but a lot more tasteful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the blight has also reached our nation's capital (or the general vicinity anyway), where at least one person has been forced to sell his penny-farthing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STKynSvpu_I/AAAAAAAAD04/jbwTeldfwhs/s1600-h/52_+Penny+Farthing+High+Wheel+Bicycle.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274474501720620018" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 175px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STKynSvpu_I/AAAAAAAAD04/jbwTeldfwhs/s400/52_+Penny+Farthing+High+Wheel+Bicycle.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/bik/931843108.html"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;52" Penny Farthing High Wheel Bicycle - $1300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt; (Frederick, MD)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-24, 6:17AM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the next big thing a 130 years later! Oh the looks you’ll get ridin’ this bad boy! This is the Excelsior model. Extremely unique 52” front wheel and a 16” rear wheel! Shipping is a bear with these bikes, but buying locally will save you big shipping charges. I may even consider delivery. This bike was built in California and retails for $1500 + $300 shipping = $1800. It is in great condition and has even appeared in some local parades. Even looks great as décor! They are soooooooooo fun to ride! I have another one that I ride so I don’t need two….so my wife says. These are the next big thing...real link below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/penny-ante-ordinary-trend-moves-up.html"&gt;http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/penny-ante-ordinary-trend-moves-up.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call eRiC if you’re interested at 301-514-[deleted]...guaranteed to make you smile!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Okay, admittedly the seller appears to be bowing to spousal pressure and not to financial need, yet you've got to admit that it's a sad day indeed when a man must part with his second p-far. (Personally, I think his wife is being unreasonable. Next she'll probably make him sell that third loom. Where does it end?!?)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Given that even I have been forced to confront the fact that things are bleak, you'd think that by now everybody else has as well--but you'd be wrong. I was poking around on the website of a popular mail-order bicycle retailer recently when I stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=26364&amp;amp;subcategory_ID=5116"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274495772223584658" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 378px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLF9ZivuZI/AAAAAAAAD1Y/3_NeT7t0StQ/s400/Campagnolo+Super+Record+11+Rear+Derailleur.jpg" border="0" /&gt;Like many cyclists, I've known for some time now that Campagnolo have both moved to 11-speed and re-introduced the Super Record group. However, like many cyclists, I also didn't really pay attention because I didn't care. For this reason, I was unaware until viewing the aforementioned link of just how shockingly expensive this stuff is. And while the whole group is expensive, for some reason it was the $500 rear derailleur that really brought it all home for me. Sure, the $480 cassette is expensive, but I suppose if you're in the later stages of syphilis or something you can rationalize it by telling yourself it's only like $43 a cog, which is about the same price as a stainless steel singlespeed cog by Chris King--plus you get the spacers free! And sure, the $625 ergo levers are also ridiculously priced, but they're really not &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; much more than other top-end shifters, and if you're in the later stages of syphilis or something you can rationalize it by telling yourself that your hands spend a lot of time on your shifters and so somehow it's worth it. Plus, I went to take a closer look at the Super Record ergos on the &lt;a href="http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/index/home_true.jsp"&gt;Campagnolo&lt;/a&gt; website, and even though they're really ugly something about them was strangely endearing to me:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLFkspBbHI/AAAAAAAAD1A/BSwRZoqEzEU/s1600-h/super+record+ergos.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274495347853454450" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 169px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 253px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLFkspBbHI/AAAAAAAAD1A/BSwRZoqEzEU/s400/super+record+ergos.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I struggled to put my finger on why this was, until I realized something about the cocked inward angle of the tops and the droopy lengths of the lever blades called to mind the visage of an expectant dog with floppy ears:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLFtasVEDI/AAAAAAAAD1I/SZ_ayJsJeUo/s1600-h/dog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274495497654308914" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 298px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 363px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLFtasVEDI/AAAAAAAAD1I/SZ_ayJsJeUo/s400/dog.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Or if you prefer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLF0gu9BRI/AAAAAAAAD1Q/8fpQvs4cUok/s1600-h/Campagnolo+-+dog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274495619535013138" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 144px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 187px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLF0gu9BRI/AAAAAAAAD1Q/8fpQvs4cUok/s400/Campagnolo+-+dog.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yes, I'm proud to say I drew that myself. Freehand!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Still, I could find nothing endearing about that stupid, ugly, overpriced, $500 rear derailleur no matter how hard I tried. Instead, I just sat there smoldering and quietly hating it. It actually bothered me that I hated it so much, so now that I was on the Campagnolo website I decided to read more about the Super Record group in the hopes that understanding it might make me hate it less. Here's what I learned:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLGMe6bnMI/AAAAAAAAD1g/4IQHqLs9yY8/s1600-h/The+official+Campagnolo+web+site+-+Bicycle+Parts+and+Components+Cycling+-+SUPER+RECORD.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274496031363144898" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 187px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLGMe6bnMI/AAAAAAAAD1g/4IQHqLs9yY8/s400/The+official+Campagnolo+web+site+-+Bicycle+Parts+and+Components+Cycling+-+SUPER+RECORD.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hmmm, "non plus ultra," you say? I don't know what that means, but I've heard that phrase used alongside other mind-blowingly expensive things and it sounds desirable. And what's that you say? "Sans pareil?" I freaking &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;hate&lt;/span&gt; pareil! My last road group had pareil and it was &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;totally&lt;/span&gt; making my shifters jam up at crucial moments, so perhaps it is worth the extra money for a group that doesn't have it. I think I'll read on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLGX2y2sbI/AAAAAAAAD1o/VE8fmuN5cY8/s1600-h/Campagnolo+-+SUPER+RECORD-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274496226752377266" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 253px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLGX2y2sbI/AAAAAAAAD1o/VE8fmuN5cY8/s400/Campagnolo+-+SUPER+RECORD-1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Okay, now you're losing me. If Super Record was introduced in 1973, and it's now 2008, how can today be "21 years later"? Wouldn't that be 1994? Also, "umpteenth"? Really? If I'm going to pay all this money to get rid of pareil I expect precision. Using the word "umpteenth" is only slightly better than using the word "gazillion." I'm surprised they actually specify "11 speeds" and don't just say it's got "gobs of gears." This is all disappointing to say the least. And what about that rear derailleur?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLGlAUZFhI/AAAAAAAAD1w/AeNPxh5lXv4/s1600-h/Campagnolo+-+SUPER+RECORDâ„¢+rear+derailleur+11s.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274496452647261714" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 116px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLGlAUZFhI/AAAAAAAAD1w/AeNPxh5lXv4/s400/Campagnolo+-+SUPER+RECORD%E2%84%A2+rear+derailleur+11s.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Okay, it's $500, and all you can say is that it's "completely black" and that it's got "parallelogram geometry"? It's now 2008--or 1994 in Campagnolo time. What derailleur &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;doesn't&lt;/span&gt; have parallelogram geometry? &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/suntour.html"&gt;According to Sheldon Brown, the parallelogram derailleur has been around since like 1964&lt;/a&gt;. That was 44 years ago--or 30 years ago in Campagnolo time. Wait, don't tell me--the shifting on Super Record is indexed too, and it's fully compatible with round wheels that roll on pneumatic tires. Well, if Campagnolo is breaking this much ground, I certainly won't hesitate to break the bank.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ah, wait, I know. It must be light. &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;Really&lt;/span&gt; light. Sure, paying lots of money to shave grams is ridiculous behavior, but then again road cycling in general is ridiculous behavior. And while I certainly don't believe in spending lots of money for ultra-light components, I also get irritated when people condemn the practice by saying things like, "You know, the difference in weight between those two components is the same as a mouthful of liquid from your water bottle," or, "If you want to remove weight, lose it from your body, not your bike." These are bad arguments. I mean, you &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;need&lt;/span&gt; liquid to ride competitively. Why would you shave weight by carrying less of it? And as far as the body thing goes, if you're truly competitive you want both your bike &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; your body to be as light as possible. Still, I do agree that it's important to keep component weight in perspective, and that's why instead of those tired old arguments I use &lt;a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm?wtm_view=&amp;amp;Group_ID=4554"&gt;New York State marijuana law&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLHO-lXhSI/AAAAAAAAD2A/cwTTF3etkzg/s1600-h/norml.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274497173736097058" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 269px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLHO-lXhSI/AAAAAAAAD2A/cwTTF3etkzg/s400/norml.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It just so happens that drug weight penalties are a good yardstick for bike weight penalties. As you can see, being caught with 25 grams of marijuana or less merely results in a civil citation in New York State, and is only punishable by a $100 fine. That's &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;less than half&lt;/span&gt; of what I had to pay when &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/08/this-just-in-bsnyc-nabbed-by-cops.html"&gt;I ran a red light on my bike&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I probably would have been better off being caught with some Wednesday weed instead. So if the police can't even be bothered to arrest you for having 25 grams of marijuana, then by extension it's kind of ridiculous to worry about a 25 gram weight difference in a bicycle component. And as the pot penalties increase, the chart can still be applied to bike weight--I think it's reasonable to consider carrying two unnecessary ounces on your race bike a misdemeanor, and I also feel that lugging ten extra pounds with you on a race bike is indeed a felony. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Given this, it would stand to reason then that the Campagnolo Super Record rear derailleur is astoundingly light, wouldn't it? Well, you'd think so, but it's not. I compared it to &lt;a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/sub_cat.cfm?subcategory_id=5116"&gt;the other rear derailleurs on the popular retailer's site&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out it's not particularly light at all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STL-DLSJ3BI/AAAAAAAAD2g/FjxTDOB5TB0/s1600-h/Rear+Derailleurs+chart-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274557444126268434" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 219px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STL-DLSJ3BI/AAAAAAAAD2g/FjxTDOB5TB0/s400/Rear+Derailleurs+chart-2.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In fact, the cheapest rear derailleur on the page was only 16 grams heavier than the Super Record, which in terms of weight penalty keeps you safely in civil-citation-with-no-jail-time territory:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLHG5CPTnI/AAAAAAAAD14/0AKLd2TvMIo/s1600-h/SRAM+rival+rear+derailleur.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274497034807627378" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 230px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STLHG5CPTnI/AAAAAAAAD14/0AKLd2TvMIo/s400/SRAM+rival+rear+derailleur.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but it's also &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;$421 dollars cheaper&lt;/span&gt;. That should buy you enough marijuana to get you some jail time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Okay, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "I can't use that cheap derailleur with my Campagnolo puppy dog ears." Well, &lt;a href="http://www.velonews.com/article/73404"&gt;even if that's true&lt;/a&gt;, you can of course use a Chorus rear derailleur, stay under the 25 gram number, and save enough money to buy yourself a couple of Rival derailleurs to experiment with. (Or three months in jail if you buy marijuana instead.) You're also thinking, "Some of those cheaper derailleurs aren't 11-speed." Well, so what? Firstly, I'm guessing that in practice the only thing that makes that derailleur 11-speed is that it says "11" on it. Secondly, I have yet to find anybody who feels compelled to go to 11-speed anyway. Sure, people rushed to go to 10-speed, and to 9-speed, and so forth. But when Campagnolo came to the party with 11-speed it was kind of like when you meet an old friend who's still way into building bongs. "Hey, look what I made!" It was pretty cool in freshman year, but now it's just kind of pathetic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But of course, we can't forget ceramic bearings. After all, ceramic bearings are the new gram-shaving, and if you're not using them you might as well be riding through two inches of mud, right? Well, thank goodness for &lt;a href="http://www.competitivecyclist.com/road-bikes/components/ceramic-speed/rear-derailleurs.1832.html"&gt;$200 derailleur pulleys&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STL7VvoZdqI/AAAAAAAAD2Y/nGavrayVTZ8/s1600-h/2009+Ceramic+Speed+Ceramic+Cartridge+Derailleur+Pulleys+-+Competitive+Cyclist.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274554464586004130" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 196px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STL7VvoZdqI/AAAAAAAAD2Y/nGavrayVTZ8/s400/2009+Ceramic+Speed+Ceramic+Cartridge+Derailleur+Pulleys+-+Competitive+Cyclist.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's frightening to me that you can buy a brand-new SRAM Red derailleur &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; put these stupid things in it for the price of a single Campagnolo Super Record derailleur. Unfortunately, though, you will no longer be able to hire the purple party machine to take you to the bike shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my big question is whether the Campagnolo Super Record derailleur is compatible with Modolo Morphos shifters, &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ee4nD4HUkWQ/SPN9rIRQHmI/AAAAAAAABno/7ma6G8M-0vw/s1600-h/cosmic_eye+copy.jpg"&gt;as mandated by the Cosmic Kurt Loder&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STMJTj_dbZI/AAAAAAAAD2w/BotmdEYXVU8/s1600-h/morphos+shifters.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274569820264557970" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 239px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 235px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STMJTj_dbZI/AAAAAAAAD2w/BotmdEYXVU8/s400/morphos+shifters.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well, I'll defer to Lennard Zinn on that one, but I will say that they look less like a puppy dog's ears than they do the horrid maw of a fly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STMJrka-0fI/AAAAAAAAD24/wZXUDXO9Gtk/s1600-h/fly+head.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274570232696852978" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 345px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STMJrka-0fI/AAAAAAAAD24/wZXUDXO9Gtk/s400/fly+head.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or if you prefer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STMI-FAKoAI/AAAAAAAAD2o/1ryIkoKB_AM/s1600-h/morphos+fly.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274569451168768002" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 396px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 310px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/STMI-FAKoAI/AAAAAAAAD2o/1ryIkoKB_AM/s400/morphos+fly.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes, I drew that one freehand too.

And if you love being miserable, you probably also love cyclocross. So if you're a miserable cyclocross-loving New Yorker (or a miserable cyclocross lover with access to New York) you'll be "pleased" to know that there will be &lt;a href="http://statencx.wordpress.com/"&gt;a cyclocross race on Staten Island next Sunday, November 30th&lt;/a&gt;. Shrouded in mystery, Staten Island is a magical place--not only because it is perpetually 1987 there, but also because it manages to make its neighbor New Jersey seem sophisticated. Also, Staten Island is ordinarily an irony-free zone, but if you're the type of person who gets uncomfortable without it I expect the organizers will bring plenty. I understand they've even secured waffle and bacon sponsors, and as everybody knows bacon is currently the ironic meat of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but this very weekend is the &lt;a href="http://www.hamptonvelo.com/"&gt;Whitmore's Landscaping Super Cross Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Southampton, LI. You may recall that this is &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/bringin-it-casanovas-couriers-and.html"&gt;the event at which you can win a Richard Sachs cyclocross bike&lt;/a&gt;. What you may not be aware of is that the promoter &lt;a href="http://velonews.com/article/85018/whitmore-s-promoter-tries-to-quash-rumors"&gt;gets very defensive when people imply that the Hamptons air is too rarified for 'cross&lt;/a&gt;, and even goes so far as to assert that Long Island is "not even an island, even though it’s called Long Island. It’s a peninsula." This struck me as an absurd claim--until I learned that &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E3DB133FF932A15752C1A9629C8B63&amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon=&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;the Supreme Court actually did rule that Long Island is a peninsula back in 1985&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly as mind-bending as that &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRww7OPpfyI/AAAAAAAADsY/3VPusDQK__Y/s1600-h/geared+singlespeed.jpg"&gt;geared singlepeed&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, there's ironic 'cross on Staten Island, as well as UCI 'cross on an ironic peninsula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I now present you with a quiz. As always, study the item, think carefully, and then click on your answer. If you're correct, you'll know if. If you're wrong, you'll see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb53LtgkyX0"&gt;this Columbia Sportswear commercial with a unicycle in it that I saw while watching "The Chocolate News."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ride safe this weekend,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--BSNYC/RTMS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSbHSWAQhdI/AAAAAAAADzA/-Yia7A0h7cI/s1600-h/intersection.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271119531841979858" style="DISPLAY: block;

Of the sites analyzed, the most masculine by a huge margin was Lance Armstrong's Twitter, at 93%. Well, I recently discovered that &lt;a href="http://sonofzonebaby.blogspot.com/"&gt;another cycling-related site&lt;/a&gt; is sitting right on Armstrong's wheel in the masculinity department, coming in at a resounding 89%:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVueuawu9I/AAAAAAAADxg/EaB979uLpmA/s1600-h/sozb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270740413042441170" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 196px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVueuawu9I/AAAAAAAADxg/EaB979uLpmA/s400/sozb.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what kind of e-pheromones Son of Zone Baby is exuding to elicit such a positive result (besides the fact it has "Son" in the title of course), but if you're looking to read something that will put some hair on your chest, go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the blog you're currently reading is holding fast at 52% female, which while not entirely accurate is at least consistent. I for one value consistency over accuracy, which it so happens is the same rationale used by many devotees of friction-shifting. Besides, regardless of whether you're running/rocking male or female reproductive organs, when it comes to being successful the real determining factor is moxie. And like this blog, moxie is gender-neutral. Take &lt;a href="http://video.style.com/?fr_story=2ddd9222ad567185bc50c8db2ebd9cdd16b434d9&amp;amp;rf=bm"&gt;this messenger-versus-model race&lt;/a&gt;, forwarded to me by a reader:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSWX-nuzxBI/AAAAAAAADyA/IY9WqakJZIc/s1600-h/model+challenge.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270786040980030482" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 217px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSWX-nuzxBI/AAAAAAAADyA/IY9WqakJZIc/s400/model+challenge.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a long tradition of pointless, apples-and-oranges, mismatched exhibition races in our culture. Jesse Owens raced against a horse, &lt;a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/?id=2002/oct02/oct24news"&gt;Mario Cipollini raced against a horse&lt;/a&gt; (though rumors he subsequently bedded it are unsubstantiated), the TV show "Top Gear" &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPnVlIaFx-4"&gt;pitted a Ford Mustang against a horse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/?id=2002/oct02/oct24news"&gt;even I raced against a Smart&lt;/a&gt; (but only because no horses were available, probably because the ASPCA got wind of the Mario Cipollini incident). However, I was immediately skeptical about this particular mismatched exhibition race when I heard the messenger, Al Busano, claim that he delivers over a thousand packages a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270734813451527554" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 229px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVpYyUQJYI/AAAAAAAADxY/EdSR95cT804/s400/Model+Challenge_+The+Street+Race+%7C+Fashion+Model,+Designer+%26+Runway+Show+Videos+from+Style.com.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bold claim to say the least. Even if Busano works ten hours a day, seven days a week, he'd need to deliver over 140 packages &lt;em&gt;a day&lt;/em&gt; in order to meet that number. That's 14 packages an hour, or roughly one package every four minutes. Either: 1) Busano is omnipresent; 2) Busano delivers mostly interoffice correspondence; or 3) Busano is inflating his number. In any case, even if he is rounding up by a factor of ten, he should have no trouble beating a fashion model on a skateboard, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVpQDSaByI/AAAAAAAADxI/XtXXQtF7vGw/s1600-h/Model+Challenge_+The+Street+Race++Fashion+Model,+Designer+&amp;amp;+Runway+Show+Videos+from+Style.com-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270734663388366626" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 216px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVpQDSaByI/AAAAAAAADxI/XtXXQtF7vGw/s400/Model+Challenge_+The+Street+Race+%7C+Fashion+Model,+Designer+%26+Runway+Show+Videos+from+Style.com-1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;...even if her "secret weapon" is apparently the ability to employ her legs in conjunction with her labia while riding a skateboard, and even if she's wearing the notoriously arresting Sue Ellen Mishky blazer-with-a-bra-for-a-top combo that made Kramer crash his car into a pole in that "Seinfeld" episode:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVpUBD-aQI/AAAAAAAADxQ/neiARDnF1cg/s1600-h/Model+Challenge_+The+Street+Race++Fashion+Model,+Designer+&amp;amp;+Runway+Show+Videos+from+Style.com-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270734731510442242" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 222px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVpUBD-aQI/AAAAAAAADxQ/neiARDnF1cg/s400/Model+Challenge_+The+Street+Race+%7C+Fashion+Model,+Designer+%26+Runway+Show+Videos+from+Style.com-2.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well, if you were pulling for the mendacious messenger to defeat the skateboarding model rocking a prehensile vagina, I'm sorry to say you were disappointed. Personally, I suspect the contest was rigged, and that the people at Style.com somehow stacked the odds in favor of the model. If they'd really wanted a close race, they'd have made her race against Mario Cipollini, though had they done that there's a good chance the competitors never would have gotten on their respective forms of wheeled conveyance and the video would have taken a decidedly pornographic turn. Or else, they could have used one of the female messengers from &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/nyregion/thecity/16mess.html"&gt;this recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. My personal choice would have been German emigree Carmen Burkhart, described in the article as "a slight, tight-bodied 43-year-old who smokes and drinks only hot coffee for hydration, even in the summer:"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270742632703678514" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 373px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVwf7TPWDI/AAAAAAAADxw/E3mjG1kShWQ/s400/Working+Hard+for+the+Money+-+The+New+York+Times+%3E+N.Y.+_+Region+%3E+Slide+Show+%3E+Slide+6+of+9.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;(Carmen Burkhart: weltschmerz in motion)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a match-up like that, the smart money would clearly be on the wiry dehydrated nicotine-and-caffeine-addled Teuton over the ditz on the skateboard. Not only that, but the video would have been way more entertaining to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But competing in phony races isn't the only thing that takes moxie. It also takes moxie to maintain your bicycle's drivetrain. And since moxie seems to be a non-renewable resource in our culture, &lt;a href="http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/index.php?cl=10730175"&gt;the Great Trek Bicycle Making Company is finally bringing to the mass market a drivetrain that requires no moxie whatsoever&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVvq-yhZCI/AAAAAAAADxo/gteHfmfU7IM/s1600-h/trek+belt+drive.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270741723107124258" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 183px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSVvq-yhZCI/AAAAAAAADxo/gteHfmfU7IM/s400/trek+belt+drive.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carbon fiber belt drive bicycle drivetrain is nothing new--we've already seen it from Spot--but Trek is wisely marketing it to the commuter rather than the racer (though &lt;a href="http://www.velonews.com/article/84860/tech-report-trek-and-travis-brown-take-belt-drive-up-a-notch"&gt;Travis Brown has been running and/or rocking one too&lt;/a&gt;). While I've been critical of Trek in the past, I have to say that I'm not only in favor of the belt drive commuter bicycle, but moreover I feel as though Trek is doing me a personal favor with it. I've &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/ups-and-downs-more-bikes-less-hope.html"&gt;voiced my irritation over the fact that so many commuters are unable to lubricate their drivetrains before&lt;/a&gt;, so a bicycle that will run quietly without lubrication is nothing less than a godsend to me. I can only hope that the lubricant-impaired take to this system &lt;em&gt;en masse &lt;/em&gt;and I never get stuck behind another squeaky, rusty, non-shifting drivetrain ever again. After all, Trek's fellow Wisconsinites Harley Davidson have already successfully shown the world that when convenience and low maintenance are more important than performance a belt drive is the way to go. (They've also convinced an entire generation of dentists and lawyers to ride around on overpriced flatulent motorcycles while wearing leather chaps, but that's something else.) And the rest of us don't even have to give up our chains--apart from the metaphorical chains that bind us to our irritating noisy-biked cousins, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but while killing off the noisy chain the Great Trek Bicycle Making Company may have unwittingly dealt the &lt;em&gt;coup de grâce&lt;/em&gt; to the already-withering colored deep-V trend as well, since &lt;a href="http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/urban/district/district"&gt;the new belt-drive District comes with high-profile rims of orange&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSWItWKRMvI/AAAAAAAADx4/2YhQmQLAbEY/s1600-h/trek+district.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270769251531174642" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 246px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSWItWKRMvI/AAAAAAAADx4/2YhQmQLAbEY/s400/trek+district.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; No way colored deep-Vs can survive this with their street cred intact.

On Monday I pointed out that &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/bsnyc-trendwatch-deep-vs-being-86ed-for.html"&gt;penny-farthings not only trump the fixed-gear in terms of zen-like simplicity, but are also "chick magnets."&lt;/a&gt; Since then, my assertion has been borne out, as photos of modern-day penny-farthings (or "p-fars," if you're the type of person who says "fixie") continue to pour in from around the world: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQ03otmCmI/AAAAAAAADw4/Uf0cCT8uTIk/s1600-h/penny+hipster.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270395594356427362" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQ03otmCmI/AAAAAAAADw4/Uf0cCT8uTIk/s400/penny+hipster.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; From &lt;a href="http://hjulcompaniet.com/"&gt;Hjulcompaniet&lt;/a&gt; in Norway comes an excellent example of what you can expect to replace the "fixter" in the coming months. Note that instead of wearing snug women's trousers, the "p-farster" is wearing loose-fitting bloomers. It's also interesting to note that he's sporting relatively modern-looking eyeglasses. There's a raging debate in the p-far community as to whether these sorts of glasses are acceptable. Proponents point out that over-the-ear eyeglasses have been around for centuries, but purists maintain that they weren't very popular until fairly recently and as such opt for the &lt;a href="http://www.eyeglasseswarehouse.com/images/theodoreroosevelt.jpg"&gt;pince-nez&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270355550345395650" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQQcxJYfcI/AAAAAAAADvg/S7xoWnsCk78/s400/penny-farthing+diagram.jpg" border="0" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Melbourne, Australia comes this fascinating example. Interestingly, this rider eschews period-correctness and has even incorporated modern accessories such as a u-lock and a spoke card (or, given the size of the wheel, a spoke treatise). Also, this photo proves once again that the p-far is a "chick magnet," as there is a blonde woman with bare legs and high heels in close proximity. It's obvious that this photo was taken just after she spotted the p-far and just before she followed the owner into the building, where she probably smiled coyly at him and encouraged him to send a telegram or perhaps even (gasp!) call upon her in person for tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQ0iT2MLFI/AAAAAAAADww/czXgOloxmw4/s1600-h/pennyhaters.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270395227978083410" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQ0iT2MLFI/AAAAAAAADww/czXgOloxmw4/s400/pennyhaters.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We've already seen colored deep-Vs and adhesive letters in the fixed-gear scene, and it would appear that the p-far scene may be following suit. Unfortunately, though, this rider has failed to take advantage of all the space with which his huge front wheel provides him. Instead of simply spacing out the letters, he could have really seized upon the opportunity to employ some flowery Victorian-era prose. If he's reading, I recommend revising this message before making a sepia-toned daguerreotype and submitting it to pennyfarthinggallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while some trend-seekers have abandoned the fixie for the p-far, others have left it for the road bike, and they're taking their fixed-gear habits with them. A reader has pointed out to me a new trend of road bikes equipped with bullhorns, and I must say that this is in line with what I've been seeing on the streets of New York City:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQRrusdGqI/AAAAAAAADvo/uguogkT_xhc/s1600-h/bullhorns+road+bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270356906896857762" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 352px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 265px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQRrusdGqI/AAAAAAAADvo/uguogkT_xhc/s400/bullhorns+road+bike.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've definitely been observing more and more people using bullhorns on their road bikes, and frankly I find it disturbing. Bullhorns became popular on fixed-gear bikes because they allow a hand position similar to that of riding with your hands on your brake hoods. However, once you've got a road bike with actual brake hoods there's no reason to use bullhorns. (Unless you're building up a time trial bike or something, in which case you're about to get sucked into the rabbit hole of compulsively anal behavior and there's no hope for you.) The drop bar with STI levers affords you all the hand positions of the bullhorn, keeps all your controls at your fingertips, and gives you the added bonus of drops when you need them. Then again, urban fixed-gear riders are highly averse to drop bars, and when they do use them it's simply an aesthetic choice. Even those who choose to maintain the stylistic integrity of their "classic" track bikes by using drop bars still often ride with their hands on the tops even when they're out of the saddle. It would follow then that they'd carry their bullhorns over to their road bikes. In fact, with more and more riders coming to other types of cycling via fixed-gears, it may be only a matter of time before the drop bar becomes extinct and bike companies start selling road bikes stock with bullhorns, top-mount brake levers, and bar-end shifters (in addition to the flat-bar road bikes they're already selling of course). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you're not ready to abandon your fixed-gear for the p-far or the bullhorn-equipped road bike? Well, fortunately there's still a place for you. In Japan. The proprietor of a "&lt;a href="http://www.wegotways.com/kinfolk/"&gt;Keirin bar&lt;/a&gt;" in Tokyo has just informed me that I can stop in for a Nama Beer if I'm ever in Nakameguro. According to the description on their website, I can also order a Ginger Mint Mojito if I prefer, and I can drink it beneath a "kaleidoscope of Japanese Keirin Track frames:" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQTKu8LGUI/AAAAAAAADvw/DMLoLK3n32o/s1600-h/about+kinfolk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270358539050359106" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 313px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 209px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQTKu8LGUI/AAAAAAAADvw/DMLoLK3n32o/s400/about+kinfolk.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQTTHgxjDI/AAAAAAAADv4/7TzwpKzQYfo/s1600-h/kinfolk+lounge.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270358683085278258" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 269px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQTTHgxjDI/AAAAAAAADv4/7TzwpKzQYfo/s400/kinfolk+lounge.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's good to know that the Ginger Mint Mojito is a "drink for any occasion," because if I do ever go to Nakameguro you can be sure to find me sucking them down in rapid succession at Kinfolk as I play with my &lt;a href="http://www.pedalmafia.com/pedalid/"&gt;tiny fixed-gear models&lt;/a&gt; beneath a kaleidoscope of Keirin frames. You can also be sure that by last call I'll be passed out in my underpants on the sofa in the background, surrounded by tiny fixed-gear models and smelling strongly of ginger like some tragic parody of Bill Murray in "Lost In Translation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tiny bicycle models, if you're looking for something to add to your own collection look no further than Philadelphia Craislist, where a reader informs me you can purchase &lt;a href="http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/bik/924528537.html"&gt;a "G.I.

JOE BUT IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO ONE. HE COMES COMPLETE WITH A HELMET, MESSENGER BAG, MACHINE GUN AND GOOGLES. HE IS DRESSED IN A COMPLETE CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORM. HIS BOOTS FIT IN THE TOE STRAPS AND THE BACK WHEEL SPINS WHEN THE PEDALS ARE TURNED BY A RUBBERBAND DRIVEN CHAIN. THE FRONT WHEEL ALSO SPINS. THERE IS A KICKSTAND THAT HOLDS HIM UP AND A WATER BOTTLE CAGE BUT NO WATER BOTTLE. THIS SOLDIER IS READY TO FIGHT! THANKS!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between those track bike models and this I may never have to leave the house again--though my play may now become a bit more bellicose. My only reservation is that the quasi-G.I. Joe's bike doesn't come with a water bottle, since I'm not sure where I'd be able to find one. (There may be one in my &lt;a href="http://www.1000barbies.com/042/SUC51112.JPG"&gt;Barbie's Workout Center&lt;/a&gt;, but I'd hate to open the shrink-wrap and break up the set.) Then again, the soldier does Google, so he may be able to find one for himself. Intrigued, I set about trying to determine whether the seller was male or female by running the ad through the &lt;a href="http://genderanalyzer.com/"&gt;Genderanalyzer&lt;/a&gt;, which yielded the following result: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQdSAz7BkI/AAAAAAAADwg/-BcSa--0rQ8/s1600-h/GenderAnalyzer+-+Determine+if+a+homepage+is+written+by+a+man+or+woman.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270369659222951490" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 148px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQdSAz7BkI/AAAAAAAADwg/-BcSa--0rQ8/s400/GenderAnalyzer+-+Determine+if+a+homepage+is+written+by+a+man+or+woman.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I guess I may never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do know, though, is that telecommunications companies are looking out for cyclists.  (Well, not specifically cyclists, but I suppose we benefit by default.) If you're a cyclist, by now you're probably accustomed to avoiding drivers who are far more engrossed in their cellphones than they are in where they're going. Personally, I'm more afraid of a driver holding a cellphone than one holding a Ginger Mint Mojito.  For this reason, I was simulaneously heartened and irritated to see this tiny icon in the corner of a Sprint cellphone advertisement in a respected and highly pretentious magazine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQdqkUiFNI/AAAAAAAADwo/-byVCC8agxE/s1600-h/focus+on+driving.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270370081071830226" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 64px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 66px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQdqkUiFNI/AAAAAAAADwo/-byVCC8agxE/s400/focus+on+driving.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wanting to learn more, I placed the highly pretentious magazine in the recycling bin where it belonged and consulted the same popular search engine the quasi-G.I. Joe uses, where I learned &lt;a href="http://www2.sprint.com/mr/cda_pkDetail.do?id=840"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQbUxehiSI/AAAAAAAADwQ/uTKBsRKddEg/s1600-h/Focus+on+Driving.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270367507623020834" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 381px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQbUxehiSI/AAAAAAAADwQ/uTKBsRKddEg/s400/Focus+on+Driving.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A cellphone company telling teens not to drive distracted is kind of like &lt;a href="http://www.jamuse.com/ViewAsset.aspx?fileID=27855"&gt;Philip Morris telling parents to talk to their kids about smoking&lt;/a&gt;, though I do appreciate the effort.  I also find it entertaining that the program speaks to teens "in their own language, using real-world examples," and I'd love to see the part of the instructional video where they show the kid pulling over safely and coming to a stop before answering that long-awaited callback from his weed dealer.  Hopefully the "Focus on Driving" program speaks more loudly to teens than &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/08/recycled-cycling-whats-happening-to-my.html"&gt;my own PSA&lt;/a&gt;, which while poignant admittedly falls into the generational gap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSRT0nCkdkI/AAAAAAAADxA/xs_2M7nmzAo/s1600-h/BSNYC_PSA.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270429627228386882" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 291px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSRT0nCkdkI/AAAAAAAADxA/xs_2M7nmzAo/s400/BSNYC_PSA.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And cellphones aren't only deadly in the hands of drivers.  We cyclists are equally vulnerable to the cellphone's siren call (or text).  Just a few days ago I witnessed a woman ride through a red light at a major intersection while on her cellphone.  She then ran into the broadside of a yellow cab (which amazingly had been doing nothing illegal or dangerous), at which point she took the phone off her ear and shouted obscenities at the driver before returning it to the side of her head and continuing on her loquacious way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as a New Yorker I suppose I should consider myself lucky, for while I may have to dodge cellphone-wielding drivers and cyclists on my commute a reader correctly points out that &lt;a href="http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2008/09/10/news/top/news01.txt"&gt;I have yet to have a run-in with a bear&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQVXxA83bI/AAAAAAAADwA/q1WqcSFCWyc/s1600-h/Missoulian_+Bear+vs.+bike_+Teacher+riding+to+school+runs+into+bruin+above+Miller+Creek.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270360961968823730" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 158px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQVXxA83bI/AAAAAAAADwA/q1WqcSFCWyc/s400/Missoulian_+Bear+vs.+bike_+Teacher+riding+to+school+runs+into+bruin+above+Miller+Creek.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was glad to see that both rider and bear seem to be OK, and that neither was using a cellphone at the time of the collision (though fortunately the bear had the wherewithal to call for an ambulance).  I was also pleased to see that the rider was on a cyclocross bike and that penny-farthing craze has not yet reached Missoula, which means that while we may see more and more of them in the coming months it should be a good while before the trend moves into its ironic phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/5139397987443137976/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=5139397987443137976' title='112 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/5139397987443137976'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/5139397987443137976'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/penny-ante-ordinary-trend-moves-up.html' title='Penny-Ante: The Ordinary Trend Moves Up a Notch'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSQ03otmCmI/AAAAAAAADw4/Uf0cCT8uTIk/s72-c/penny+hipster.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>112</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-2205056823656953498</id><published>2008-11-18T08:29:00.025-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-18T14:33:12.500-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='worst of craigslist'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cycling'/><title type='text'>Gender Politics: Sex, Bikes, and Relationships</title><content type='html'>As we saw yesterday, the winds of change continue to blow, and it seems like colored deep-V rims may be on their way out. While I'm doubtless not the only person who has been longing for their disappearance, the unfortunate truth is that this could also lead to the demise of &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQcDZZbFMtI/AAAAAAAADeI/G8fKtvCr_mE/s1600-h/fagget+ass+hipsters.jpg"&gt;humorous messages applied to wheels with adhesive letters&lt;/a&gt;. Then again, as long as people continue to use spokes they will continue to express themselves with their wheels. Take &lt;a href="http://fixedgeargallery.com/2008/nov/2/TeamBOC3_aol.htm"&gt;this bike&lt;/a&gt;, for example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLLRKdmxzI/AAAAAAAADu4/LMI_xGxNmYY/s1600-h/obamabike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269998009703647026" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLLRKdmxzI/AAAAAAAADu4/LMI_xGxNmYY/s400/obamabike.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sometimes when the winds of change blow a bunch of debris gets caught in the spokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of change, fashion is not the only thing that is mercurial. It appears that gender too can be a bit of a moving target. A reader informs me that he plugged this very blog into the "&lt;a href="http://www.genderanalyzer.com/"&gt;Genderanalyzer&lt;/a&gt;," and it came back with the result that &lt;a href="http://www.genderanalyzer.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbikesnobnyc.blogspot.com"&gt;I am most likely a female&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLIB5TCJ3I/AAAAAAAADuw/ZumBlNN4KHI/s1600-h/genderizer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269994448862979954" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 273px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLIB5TCJ3I/AAAAAAAADuw/ZumBlNN4KHI/s400/genderizer.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be perfectly honest, I have mixed feelings about this result. On one hand, I find it heartening that I have achieved near gender-neutrality, as I of course take great pains not to be a part of &lt;a href="http://www.derailerbicyclecollective.org/programs.html"&gt;the patriarchy of bike culture and bike shops and to ensure that nobody is exluded due to their gender identity&lt;/a&gt;. Then again, I can't help but find my gender neutrality somewhat disconcerting as well. I think most of us like to think that our genders are readily discernible to others. As such, learning that I'm slightly a woman makes me feel like some combination of the portrait of Dorian Gray and that photograph of Michael J. Fox in "Back to the Future" in which he fades in and out depending on whether he's being successful in making his parents hook up--it's as though my own "parts" are constantly changing depending on which side of the 50% barrier my gender index is on at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued and disgusted by this notion, I decided to test the accuracy of the Genderanalyzer by plugging in the blogs of some other cycling writers of whose genders I'm reasonably certain. First I tried &lt;a href="http://fatcyclist.com/"&gt;Fat Cyclist&lt;/a&gt;, who it turns out &lt;a href="http://genderanalyzer.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffatcyclist.com"&gt;is 62% man&lt;/a&gt;. Though not a landslide, the result is certainly decisive and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up was &lt;a href="http://howtoavoidthebummerlife.com/"&gt;HTATBL&lt;/a&gt;, and it may come as a surprise to its author Stevil Kinevil that he is (according to the Genderanalyzer) &lt;a href="http://genderanalyzer.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhowtoavoidthebummerlife.com"&gt;a whopping 75% female&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure what led the Genderanalyzer to its incorrect conclusion, but I'm sure Stevil will be pleased to know that he can always print out this result, have it laminated, and use it to gain access to Super Power Inclusion Night at the Derailer Bicycle Collective in Denver, CO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up was Jim at &lt;a href="http://unholyrouleur-jim.blogspot.com/"&gt;Unholy Rouleur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://genderanalyzer.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Funholyrouleur-jim.blogspot.com%2F"&gt;who was correctly diagnosed to be a male&lt;/a&gt;. (He came in at 67%.) I'm not sure why the Genderanalyzer didn't simply check his profile, since the fact that he's named Jim should have upped the odds considerably, but in any case it was correct so I suppose that's all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I sent the Genderanalyzer over to unretired professional cyclist, cancer activist, &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8FxwzoMCI/AAAAAAAADjQ/Mdx0oRFI6vQ/s1600-h/la+in+smock.jpg"&gt;fashion icon&lt;/a&gt;, and budding social networking enthusiast &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lancearmstrong"&gt;Lance Armstrong's Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The Genderanalyzer had little doubt as to Armstrong's gender, and it &lt;a href="http://genderanalyzer.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Flancearmstrong"&gt;pronounced him to be a male with a probability of 93%&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I'm sure that this overwhelming result will only lead his detractors to accuse him of using testosterone, and I'm also sure the USADA testers are kicking down his door and demanding that he urinate in a cup as you read this. If you live in the Austin area you've probably seen Armstrong's USADA "urine detail," but if you haven't I can tell you that they shadow him in a Plymouth Reliant and they look uncannily like Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez in the 1987 film "Stakeout:"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLzD33iD3I/AAAAAAAADvY/Wd2DmAvNKiw/s1600-h/stakeout.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270041761838927730" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 285px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLzD33iD3I/AAAAAAAADvY/Wd2DmAvNKiw/s400/stakeout.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Just imagine the person attached to that leg slipping on a Nike cycling shoe instead of a red pump and you've got the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it comes to gender and stalking, nobody is in a better position to stalk people of the opposite sex than &lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mis/920784366.html"&gt;a bike messenger&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLSh8Wny7I/AAAAAAAADvQ/Cr-6_zJ2ryg/s1600-h/to+the+girl+in+the+architecture+office+-+m4w-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270005994555427762" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 119px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLSh8Wny7I/AAAAAAAADvQ/Cr-6_zJ2ryg/s400/to+the+girl+in+the+architecture+office+-+m4w-1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to the girl in the architecture office&lt;/strong&gt; - m4w - 26 (everywhere)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-15, 8:01PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are every beautiful girl in every architecture office, at your desk by the door, with your dignified "we love modernism even though we know it's so over" style and your glasses. I am the bike messenger, one of the smart ones too stubborn to get a real job, the architecture school dropout, who is in your office for 15 seconds at a time, who you smile at, who you offer water, who you ask if it's still raining out. I never have time to chat, but maybe after work sometime we can wax nostalgic about saarinen and kahn and talk about the houses we someday want to build for ourselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can't always tell people's gender from their writing, you can usually tell right away whether or not they're smart. Still, this particular person felt the need to come right out and say it. And if you're still not sure, he's also dropped some names. (As a smart person myself, neither reference was lost on me, and I know both Saarinen and Kahn as notorious "Star Trek" villains.) Furthermore, not content to tout his own intellectual superiority, he's also gone ahead and disparaged other messengers as well as the vocation of messengering by suggesting that it is not a "real job." I suppose what he really means to say is that he's a person of privilege, and that as a person of privilege he has elected as a form of self-expression to do a job that other less privileged people must simply do in order to survive. Moreover, he's also saying that those who are messengers by necessity rather than choice are stupid--or at least not as smart as he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this, it's no surprise then that so many messengers are poorly compensated and receive no benefits. After all, it's a lifestyle choice, not a real job, right? So why would "smart" people who messenger instead of getting "real jobs" bother to demand better treatment when all they really require is an excuse to ride around the city on weekdays and lord their superiority over non-messengers at alleycats? Sure, this attitude doesn't work out so well for their many co-workers who actually &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to messenger, but then again those people ride crappy bikes and speak different languages and don't dress well and are totally unsexy. They're the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/keep-it-simple-stupid-go-fixie.html"&gt;lumpen-proletariat&lt;/a&gt;. Who would want to have anything to do with them? Certainly not beautiful girls who work in architecture offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, I wish our smart and stubborn bike messenger luck. I hope he does get together with a beautiful architect, and that together they build a glass house on a hill from which they can gaze bemusedly upon the lumpen-proletariat below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lumpen-proletariat is not the only distasteful group of people out there testing the patience of the sophisticated urban cyclist. &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/no-getting-around-it-cycling-and.html"&gt;There's also the Hasidim&lt;/a&gt;. And I wouldn't expect this rivalry to end anytime soon, for it seems the "hipsters" may already have taken to actively baiting their pious minivan-driving adversaries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLSGrDRUgI/AAAAAAAADvI/6-c2RFhPFAA/s1600-h/you+ride+a+converted+track+bike...+-+w4m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270005526054392322" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 68px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLSGrDRUgI/AAAAAAAADvI/6-c2RFhPFAA/s400/you+ride+a+converted+track+bike...+-+w4m.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;you ride a converted track bike... - w4m - 25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-12, 1:50PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...black with straight handlebars. you dodged the minivans in south williamsburg beautifully- i am a scandal, a reason for the outcry of bike lane indecency in my neighborhood. wanna be part of the problem?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one who longs to see a peaceful coexistence along the Great Hipster Silk Route, I was dismayed to read this. Certainly intentionally scandalizing your neighbors is no way to live in harmony with them. My only hope is that this is an isolated incident. Perhaps this particular woman is simply a Semitic exhibitionist who derives a perverse thrill from being watched by Hasidim, and she's hoping that the guy with the conversion and the straight handlebar shares her proclivities. Assuming this is the case and they do connect, they can then place another Craigslist ad seeking a &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyan"&gt;minyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to observe their lovemaking. And maybe--just maybe-- such a fetish will allow the "hipsters" and the Hasidim live happily together after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hope that things have gotten better over in London. A reader recently forwarded me this article from his archives, which despite being a year or so old is still relevant today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLDZ3X4EbI/AAAAAAAADuo/uYzoPE10T68/s1600-h/dickhead.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269989363105141170" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSLDZ3X4EbI/AAAAAAAADuo/uYzoPE10T68/s400/dickhead.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're anything like me, you're simultaneously shocked that a cyclist could be capable of such brutality and dismayed that there's no video of what doubtless must have been a highly entertaining and comical interaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, you may recall that not too long ago &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/shades-of-marketing-art-of-salesmanship.html"&gt;I was somewhat critical of a marketing video for the Oso Bike&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I'm pleased to report that Oso Bike owner Shane Stock has just informed me he's produced a &lt;a href="http://www.osobike.com/VIDEO.html"&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FBaVIuTlgIE&amp;amp;color1=" width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" color2="0xcfcfcf&amp;amp;hl=" fs="1" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure you'll agree that, with its high-energy techno soundtrack, Stock has finally managed to capture the spirit and excitement of his famous backyard Bacchanalia.

Regardless of whether you're a roadie, mountain biker, singlespeeder, fixed-gear freestyler, triathlete, randonneur, commuter, BMXer, or one of the many types of "freak cyclists" (recumbent riders, triathletes, etc.), always remember that your discipline is subject to the whims of fashion, and to fall out of step with fashion is to miss the very point of cycling itself. So before you lube your chain, top off your tires, and make sure your bolts are torqued properly, you should always make sure your bike is not violating whatever style code is applicable to the sort of riding you do before you head out on your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I feel it is my duty to alert you to the fact that one of cycling's most visible trends--&lt;a href="http://fixedgeargallery.com/2008/nov/2/JayDougrey.htm"&gt;the bubblegum-hued deep-V rim trend&lt;/a&gt;--may at last be waning. It turns out that no less an authority than aggregator-slash-arbiter of fixed-gear freestyle chic, Prolly, &lt;a href="http://prollyisnotprobably.com/2008/11/back_to_basics.php"&gt;has abandoned his own deep-Vs for the "greener" (or more accurately, blacker) pastures of disc-specific 29er rims&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, he's even gone so far as to express hope that "more and more people will see this and begin to rock* lighter, more durable wheels and not just focus on color-matching their rims to their grips."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;(Note: "Rock" means "use;" if you're a competitive cyclist, substitute "run" for "rock." Never use the word "use" or "ride" with regard to bicycle componentry--unless your typical cycling outfit includes a reflective velcro pant cuff retainer and a helmet mirror--and always observe the proper "rock/run" distinction depending on the type of cycling you do. If you're uncertain, generally speaking if you "session" then you "rock" a certain piece of equipment; if you race, then you "run" it.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud Prolly's decision to embrace function over form and to rock what works best for him. However, the implications of his call for the rest of fixed-geardom to follow are serious and far-reaching and I can't help feeling it was a bit irresponsible of Prolly to announce such a change without putting a contingency plan in place. I don't want to cause a panic, but I would strongly recommend that if you are rocking (or, less likely, running) colored deep-V rims that you remove them from your bike immediately and consign them to a closet until we know for sure where this is going. If they are in fact going out of style then it will be at least a few years before your colored deep-V rims can be rocked again ironically. (Something can be rocked ironically once the last person who has been rocking it sincerely has finally stopped rocking it, which is why it is vital to closely monitor remote corners of the midwest for trend fallout. Premature Ironic Rockage--or PIR--can be very dangerous, as sincerity and irony can be toxic if allowed to mix.) Remember, this is not a recall--it is simply a "wheel advisory," like &lt;a href="http://velonews.com/article/84580/shimano-issues-wheel-advisory"&gt;Shimano recently issued because of their poorly-designed spoke plugs&lt;/a&gt;. (If you are in possession of that particular wheel, I recommend either rocking or running rim tape depending on your riding style.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for other forms of fashionable fixed-gear wheels, it's difficult to say what this means. The Hed 3 remains popular (particularly when &lt;a href="http://velospace.org/node/11130"&gt;it costs more than the rest of the bike on which it is being rocked&lt;/a&gt;), though the rise of the 29er disc rim in the fixed-gear freestyle realm may mean that the Hed 3 is only rocked on special occasions. Say, for example, your evening will not involve sessioning but it will involve a leisurely ride to a trendy bar in order to take in the premier of a new fixed-gear movie. In such a case the Hed 3 might be appropriate and thus could become the fixed-gear equivalent of putting on a bow tie. Even so, if you ride a fixed-gear and you don't already own a Hed 3 I would advise against purchasing one for the time being. Actually, I'd advise agaist purchasing any deep-section rim right now. So if you're in the midst of some kind of piecemeal upgrade like &lt;a href="http://fixedgeargallery.com/2008/nov/2/XanderSpohn.htm"&gt;the rider below&lt;/a&gt;, who's already got the long-valve tube but is evidently still saving up for the deep-dish wheel to go with it, I would keep your money in escrow. (Though you may allow your bike to continue engaging in auto-fellatio.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGFVQPFXEI/AAAAAAAADuY/1zycqykexzs/s1600-h/licking+self.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269639639182171202" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 342px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGFVQPFXEI/AAAAAAAADuY/1zycqykexzs/s400/licking+self.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as aerospokes go, I maintain that they've already gone from sincere to ironic, as you can see &lt;a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2517561732_2af5762906.jpg?v=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Moreover, here in New York City the "&lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/07/rack-and-opinion-future-of-bike-parking.html"&gt;almost-spoke&lt;/a&gt;" design has actually &lt;a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/hoop-wins-bike-rack-design-contest/?hp"&gt;won the Department of Transportation's CityRacks Design competition&lt;/a&gt;, which means we'll soon be seeing almost-spokes all over town:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGFz2oMH1I/AAAAAAAADug/XCs1XteIBgA/s1600-h/â€˜Hoopâ€™+Wins+Bike-Rack+Design+Contest+-+City+Room+Blog+-+NYTimes.com.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269640164884094802" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 322px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGFz2oMH1I/AAAAAAAADug/XCs1XteIBgA/s400/%E2%80%98Hoop%E2%80%99+Wins+Bike-Rack+Design+Contest+-+City+Room+Blog+-+NYTimes.com.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Note that the DOT is calling it the "Hoop," though this is clearly a thinly-veiled attempt to get around Aerospoke's trademark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less clear is whether knuckle tattoos have moved from sincere to ironic. One thing's for sure, though: they're still in style. A reader recently forwarded me this moving image:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGAXidDcQI/AAAAAAAADuQ/aw-Jxr_Wp0U/s1600-h/love+tits.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269634180874203394" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGAXidDcQI/AAAAAAAADuQ/aw-Jxr_Wp0U/s400/love+tits.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If this is a man, then these hands obviously belong to a fixed-gear rider, since as we all know &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ83VMf73I/AAAAAAAADmo/50s99nUdEUw/s1600-h/gearsareforqueers.jpg"&gt;gears are for queers&lt;/a&gt;. (Or for anyone &lt;a href="http://www.derailerbicyclecollective.org/programs.html"&gt;who is excluded by the patriarchy of bike culture and bike shops because of their gender identity&lt;/a&gt;.) Then again, this may not say "Love Tits," since the little ladies' room symbol isn't necessarily standing in for an "I." It could be an "A," and the tattoo could say "Love Tats." It could also be an "O," which would mean that the wearer either loves Tater Tots or simply loves tots, as in toddlers. If it's the latter, that is disturbing for a whole other set of reasons. I don't know what kind of bikes the people who love tots ride, but I do know tot-lovers are not treated very well in prison. It could also be that the wearer is a woman, and she's simply expressing her exclusion by the patriarchy of bike culture and bike shops because of her gender identity. But whatever the case, it's safe to say that knuckle tattoos are still hotter than a freshly-microwaved tater tot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to trends, probably the only thing hotter than a knuckle tattoo is a penny-farthing. When it comes to "keeping it real," the penny-farthing makes the fixed-gear look as obnoxiously high-tech as a 22-speed crabon fiber wonder bike. &lt;a href="http://kwallblog.blogspot.com/"&gt;Erik K&lt;/a&gt; sent me this photo, and while I was pleased to see that the rider was not rocking a colored deep-V I was also dismayed that the bike wasn't locked up well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGARrSNQHI/AAAAAAAADuI/dKZc2Nq_ieA/s1600-h/pennyfarthing+a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269634080165412978" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGARrSNQHI/AAAAAAAADuI/dKZc2Nq_ieA/s400/pennyfarthing+a.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you ride a bike as hot as this you simply cannot leave it &lt;del&gt;unlocked&lt;/del&gt; poorly locked and unattended. Not only do you run the risk of having your bike stolen by someone who looks like &lt;a href="http://ecoworldly.com/files/2008/03/handlebar-moustache1.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but you'll also have to put old-timey "Wanted" posters all over town since the sorts of people who ride penny-farthings don't use Craigslist. (Too high-tech.) And if you're still in doubt that penny-farthings are desireable, here's a second photo which proves they're indeed chick magnets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGAMZ-bR_I/AAAAAAAADuA/VAxSFz-E4TM/s1600-h/pennyfarthing.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269633989619697650" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 282px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SSGAMZ-bR_I/AAAAAAAADuA/VAxSFz-E4TM/s400/pennyfarthing.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Oh, yes. Gears may be for queers, but diamond frames, two wheels of equal size, and non-direct drive transmissions are for nellies and confirmed bachelors.

As always, study the question carefully and choose your answer.  If you're right you'll see the item or some other confirmation that you're correct.  If you're wrong, you'll see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcT5bT7dyeM"&gt;part I of the episode of "Family Ties" in which Alex P. Keaton gets addicted to speed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note that, as usual, this quiz contains a melange of material, some of which I came across myself and some of which was forwarded by readers.  I just want to take this opportunity to thank the many readers who send me links and photos.  Please know that, while I'm not always able to respond, I'm always grateful to receive it and I consider myself very fortunate to receive so much email, even when it is somewhat disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, thanks for reading, and ride safe this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--BSNYC/RTMS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SR19lxbb-EI/AAAAAAAADtI/fBvCJvfZAP4/s1600-h/I_m+a+polarizing+figure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268505226970396738" style="DISPLAY: block;

And weirdness is like an annoying song or a word you never heard before, because once you become aware of it you suddenly realize it's everywhere. Take for example the latest wheel from mail-order retailer Performance, forwarded to me by a reader:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRwwU_OPSII/AAAAAAAADsQ/r49F3eB_hkc/s1600-h/Performance_Haters.png"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268138801243310210" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 362px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRwwU_OPSII/AAAAAAAADsQ/r49F3eB_hkc/s400/Performance_Haters.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I must admit I was taken in by this clever fabrication, and only realized it wasn't real when I tried to place an order for one to put on my Ironic Orange Julius Bike. While you might think that makes me gullible, keep in mind Performance have already &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/09/no-money-mo-problems-involuntary.html"&gt;referenced this blog in the past&lt;/a&gt;, so a &lt;em&gt;prêt-à-rouler&lt;/em&gt; AYHSMB wheel is really not so far outside the velodrome of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're looking for weird &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; real, look no further than this mind-bendingly freakish geared singlespeed cyclocross bike, photographed by a reader at the &lt;a href="http://sscxwc.com/"&gt;SSCXWC this past weekend&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRww7OPpfyI/AAAAAAAADsY/3VPusDQK__Y/s1600-h/geared+singlespeed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268139458110783266" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRww7OPpfyI/AAAAAAAADsY/3VPusDQK__Y/s400/geared+singlespeed.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, a bicycle with dual 39-tooth chainrings up front and eight 16-tooth cogs in the rear may seem pointless. But upon further reflection, it becomes apparent that this bicycle is not so much about functionality as it is about challenging the very definition of a singlespeed. Is a bicycle that shifts still a singlespeed? After all, there is only one possible gear ratio. Then again, does this bicycle offer the rider an advantage that the traditional singlespeed (or even the dinglespeed) does not--that being the ability to continue on in the event of a damaged cog or chainring without dismounting? Is this advantage cancelled out by the fact that damage to the derailleur could render the bike unrideable? Most importantly, what does this bicycle say about the world we live in? I put forth that it says a great deal about fate and the illusion of choice. If one believes in fate, then certainly one believes that regardless of what choices we make the end result will be the same. Are we not all shifting and shifting our whole lives yet never out-shifting inevitability? The fatalist would probably argue that we are. Whether you love or hate this bike may say less about your definition of a singlespeed than it does about your views on predestination and free will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After viewing and pondering this photo I then visited &lt;a href="http://www.swobo.com/htatbl/archives/2008/11/i_have_been_to_the_mountain_1.html"&gt;HTATBL&lt;/a&gt;. I can't say with certainty whether I did so by fate or free will, but I can say I learned from the photo at the bottom of the page that the Predestination Bike belongs to none other than Chris DiStefano of Chris King as he is pictured with it. He confirmed that the bike shifts across the entire range front and rear, but he would neither confirm nor deny that Chris King is planning to bring a geared singlespeed drivetrain to market. (Though in fairness to him that was probably because I didn't ask him.) In any case, &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natearm/3023113649/"&gt;here's a closer look&lt;/a&gt; if you'd like to meditate on it further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this isn't the only perplexing bike out there. Not by a long shot. It appears that there's &lt;a href="http://denver.craigslist.org/bik/915704391.html"&gt;a one-man operation in Denver that specializes in freak bikes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixie/Single Speed conversions, frames and complete bikes for sale. - $100&lt;/strong&gt; (Hardsole5280)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-11, 11:46PM MST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*High quality single speed and fixed gear conversions *I can build anything from a sturdy polished turd to a fully blinged out race machine, as with anything the sky is the limit.

I have all the correct tools to do conversions properly, several years under my belt as a bike tech at a few diffrent shops and I take my time to do the work right. I stand behind my work and will always tune up one of my bikes as long as you can bring it to me. On that note, I can do tune ups on all bikes, but my rates are no less then that of a reputable shop, and I am all for people supporting their local shop. I do however like to wrench on vintage hi end stuff, and have seen most everything out there.&lt;br /&gt;Need advice building your own bike?

If you're going to make an impractical mechanical choice, I feel that choice should at least serve some higher purpose. It should strive to provoke thought, challenge people's preconceptions, or allude to some greater truth. These on the other hand seem to have been done simply to prove they can be done. They're irreverent at best, and ostentatious and dangerous at worst. And both have been done already anyway. But some mechanics can raise the freak bike to an art form. Their medium is the workaround, and their &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2007/10/fixedgeargalleryof-dogged-determination.html"&gt;art is a symphony of kludges that can be heartrending to behold&lt;/a&gt;. Or at least &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-am-highly-specialized-right-tool-for.html"&gt;highly entertaining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's this, spotted in Tucson:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRxcNNIY6cI/AAAAAAAADsw/AkwWU8q7Ra0/s1600-h/moto-spinergy.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268187046049540546" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRxcNNIY6cI/AAAAAAAADsw/AkwWU8q7Ra0/s400/moto-spinergy.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I generally discount a bicycle once a motor has been applied to it, I feel this one is noteworthy in that it employs a Spinergy Rev-X. Even though that engine probably puts out less horesepower than an electric pencil sharpener, I'd still be frightened to send any horespower to a wheel as brittle as the Spinergy. Then again, judging from the right side, it looks like the bicycle can also be operated in regular pedal mode. (Unless that gear is simply there to kickstart the engine.) In any case, I'm sure you could at least raise the wheel off the ground and use it to cut meat, so congratulations to the builder on what is surely the world's first offroad deli slicer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, contradicitons can be cacophonous or mellifluous, and here's &lt;a href="http://fixedgeargallery.com/2008/nov/2/TroyToews.htm"&gt;an example from the fixedgeargallery of the former&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRw4e9HryhI/AAAAAAAADso/lFNulmqbpEw/s1600-h/one+less+car.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268147768570661394" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRw4e9HryhI/AAAAAAAADso/lFNulmqbpEw/s400/one+less+car.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I should be clear that I have nothing against people who own both bicycles and cars. It's the 21st century after all, and sometimes you just need a car. Sure, some people choose to &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/02/haulin-ass-and-some-furniture-moving-by.html"&gt;move by bike&lt;/a&gt;, or to transport their wives to the hospital in bicycle cargo trailers when they go into labor, but the fact remains that sometimes it is OK to drive. (Though I don't understand why Papa John's uses cars to deliver pizzas in Brooklyn--nor why anyone in Brooklyn would order from Papa John's.) However, I can't stress enough that car ownership automatically disqualifies you from having a "One Less Car" sticker on your bicycle. Period. We've &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/06/this-just-in-one-less-car-in-la.html"&gt;seen this sort of thing before&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, I suppose this person think's it's OK since when he's on his bike he's not driving his car at the moment, thus freeing up some space on the road. But that's like wearing a straight-edge t-shirt and taking it off when you get high. Or maybe he was contemplating buying a Lancer Evo in addition to the car he already has, but decided to use the down payment on the Jamis instead, so he figured the sticker was acceptable. But it's just not. A theoretical car that might have been is simply not an actual car. The sticker makes even less sense since it's pretty obvious from his choice of vehicle that he enjoys cars and driving. Self-hating car drivers at odds with their own automobile ownership drive things like Priuses; they don't drive rally-inspired sports cars like the Subaru WRX. And whatever they drive, they don't use it as a prop when they submit their bicycle to an online gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps I should go back to gazing into the eight-speed singlespeed Cassette of Predestination.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/5084253281753023213/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=5084253281753023213' title='122 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/5084253281753023213'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/5084253281753023213'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/contradictions-contemplating-mysteries.html' title='Contradictions: Contemplating the Mysteries of Cycling'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRwwU_OPSII/AAAAAAAADsQ/r49F3eB_hkc/s72-c/Performance_Haters.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>122</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-2460243757108159384</id><published>2008-11-12T09:00:00.025-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-08T18:49:31.334-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='commuting by bicycle'/><title type='text'>The Indignity of Commuting by Bicycle: Weirdness</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr7cT_xU0I/AAAAAAAADsI/DkGzT34pkMA/s1600-h/pining.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267799177985872706" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr7cT_xU0I/AAAAAAAADsI/DkGzT34pkMA/s400/pining.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all long for something. I think it's safe to say that, no matter how free from petty concerns some of us may be, each one of us has some deeper desire that compels us forward. Gandhi longed for a free India; Levi longed to ride (until &lt;a href="http://www.letleviride.com/"&gt;his site was taken down&lt;/a&gt;); and the owner of the "&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/R_5tFHW0prI/AAAAAAAAB-4/YWb6ZKvtFTY/s1600-h/haters-1.jpg"&gt;All You Haters Suck My Balls&lt;/a&gt;" wheel longs for all you haters to suck his balls. Even inanimate objects can long for other inanimate objects, as you can see from the above photo which depicts a Schwinn longing for a Vespa. I'm sure the Schwinn's owner also longs to move from one dandyish mode of urban transport to another. If you've ever purchased a new bike you know that moment of excitement and anticipation when you move your saddlebag from your old bike to the new one. I imagine the Schwinn-to-Vespa transfer would be similar, except instead of a saddlebag you'd move a loaf of French bread or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too long for something, and that is a world without stupid behavior. And recently, I made an important discovery, which is that while you can't change the world you can change your own perception of it. Certainly I can't eradicate stupidity from the Earth (if only because that would also involve eradicating myself), but I can keep myself from getting angry about that stupidity. This realization in turn brought me to a revelation: Stupidity minus Anger equals Weirdness. In other words, when I observe something inexplicable and get angry about it, I've observed something stupid. But when I observe something inexplicable and don't get angry, I've simply observed something weird. And weirdness is much easier to live with than stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take for example this taxi, which stopped abruptly in front of me in the bike lane this morning in order to pick up a fare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr6WmdMk3I/AAAAAAAADrw/1pHWa7xWUdk/s1600-h/minivan+cab+1.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267797980350288754" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr6WmdMk3I/AAAAAAAADrw/1pHWa7xWUdk/s400/minivan+cab+1.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I failed to capture the fare before she disappeared into the taxi, but I will say she was blonde and she had probably been waiting for a minivan taxi for some time, as it's one of the few hailable vehicles in the city that could have accommodated her girth. While you'll note that there is some room left in the bike lane for me to pass, there's also a truck directly in front of the taxi. However, instead of getting angry, squeezing through, and verbally attacking the driver, I chose to simply stop and observe. Sure enough, what might have otherwise stricken me as stupid (a taxi stopping directly in front of me to pick up a fare almost as large as itself) simply appeared weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr6tTOdKiI/AAAAAAAADr4/M-cywxc8xlI/s1600-h/minivan+cab+2.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267798370325178914" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr6tTOdKiI/AAAAAAAADr4/M-cywxc8xlI/s400/minivan+cab+2.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second shot I took as I passed reveals the extent of the weirdness, since as you can see there was plenty of room for the taxi driver to let me pass and then pull up alongside the curb. (Sure, he would have been blocking a fire hydrant, but even if a fire were to suddenly break out would the city really be worse off for the loss of a restaurant called "Nooch?") Weird, then, that he would instead speed past me and suddenly stop, as if his large fare might suddenly flee like a frightened mammal of the plains. In fact, when he stopped for her the urgency with which he did so made me think he was going to leap out of the taxi and apprehend her with a net. In any case, he didn't seem to mind my photographing him, and he even waved to me as he drove off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr69K6T33I/AAAAAAAADsA/zoJjCcAJOOI/s1600-h/minivan+cab+3.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267798642971107186" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRr69K6T33I/AAAAAAAADsA/zoJjCcAJOOI/s400/minivan+cab+3.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a freaking weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was other weirdness as well. These days, aggressive urban riding is in vogue, and I attribute this to the spate of fixed-gear movies featuring people riding in traffic (such as &lt;a href="http://www.mashsf.com/videos.php"&gt;MASH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/from-bsnyc-culture-desk-bsnyc-attends.html"&gt;Macaframa&lt;/a&gt;, and the upcoming &lt;a href="http://empirebegins.com/"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;). It is now &lt;em&gt;de rigeur&lt;/em&gt; to weave heedlessly through traffic, and apparently it is a forfeiture of your masculinity to stop at a red light under any circumstances. (Though apparently you can salvage a bit of it by at least doing a trackstand at the light.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while many of these riders have the look down they don't have the ability to match. Lately, I've been getting stuck behind riders who have misjudged the distance between cars and been forced to stop. (It's a sad sight, really--like watching a cat get its head caught in a shoe or something.) I've also been finding myself literally being circled at red lights, since the people who can't trackstand just ride around and around instead. (Imagine being circled by a shark, but the shark's riding a Pista, wearing a u-lock holster, and looks mildly afraid instead of coolly detached.) And just this morning, I was riding behind either a messenger or some approximation of a messenger whose riding style had all the trappings of the urban daredevil--except for the speed. He couldn't have been going more than a few miles an hour, but he weaved unecessarily between cars and even skitched off a barely-moving van for a few moments. I would have gladly let him ride away from me, but it would have impossible to do so without stopping altogether. After he let go of the van, he swung his arm around and around exactly like Pete Townshend banging out a power chord (I'm not sure if this was to warn me of his turn or to rub my nose in the fact that he had just performed the world's slowest skitch) and headed west on an eastbound street. It was like watching someone clear a hopscotch course and then give you the finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to weirdness, nobody outdoes the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/OpinionatedCyclist"&gt;Opinionated Cyclist&lt;/a&gt;. A polarizing figure in the cycling world, the OC has recently taken to talking almost exclusively about me. To be completely honest, I find this very disappointing as I feel it is a tremendous waste of his prodigious talent. However, I also acknowledge he does have some legitimate concerns: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRrhqddBHPI/AAAAAAAADrQ/1oLR0MU9AtA/s1600-h/Bikesnob+-+irresponsible+journalism+AT+BEST.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267770833740307698" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 340px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRrhqddBHPI/AAAAAAAADrQ/1oLR0MU9AtA/s400/Bikesnob+-+irresponsible+journalism+AT+BEST.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now I'm not a journalist (&lt;a href="http://i35.tinypic.com/2enuyb8.gif"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a journalist), nor do I believe in patrolling comments, but I will go on record as saying that there's no evidence of which I'm aware that the OC has ever harmed a sex worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRrhxGSM4CI/AAAAAAAADrY/Vx3WD8mKtOI/s1600-h/Bikesnob+-+irresponsible+journalism+AT+BEST-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267770947780010018" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 338px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRrhxGSM4CI/AAAAAAAADrY/Vx3WD8mKtOI/s400/Bikesnob+-+irresponsible+journalism+AT+BEST-1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That said, in the spirit of the principles on which this great nation was founded (chief among those principles being the right of every American to purchase &lt;a href="http://www.gazebodepot.com/"&gt;quality pre-built gazebos at discount prices&lt;/a&gt;) I refuse to censor comments.

Better yet, instead of calling Jim (a.k.a. the &lt;a href="http://unholyrouleur-jim.blogspot.com/"&gt;Unholy Rouleur&lt;/a&gt;) "dumb," simply apply the "Stupidity minus Anger equals Weirdness" formula. If you don't get angry at Jim's comments you'll realize his claims are simply weird. And weird can even be funny. (If you're the sort of person who finds dead prostitute jokes funny, that is.

I on the other hand am searching for a one-inch threaded disc-compatible fork and some sense in the fixed-gear world, and so far I've been unable to find either one. Though I rarely venture beyond my local Craigslist, a reader recently forwarded me &lt;a href="http://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/bik/909177661.html"&gt;this listing&lt;/a&gt; from Boston, which I felt was noteworthy in its utter wrongheadedness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmWL0CFLeI/AAAAAAAADq4/AYaZ8XqW9xI/s1600-h/Fixed+Gear_Single+Speed+Road+Bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267406368876604898" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 162px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmWL0CFLeI/AAAAAAAADq4/AYaZ8XqW9xI/s400/Fixed+Gear_Single+Speed+Road+Bike.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Gear/Single Speed Road Bike - $360&lt;/strong&gt; (Framingham)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: sale-[deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-07, 5:32AM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fifteen new bikes, closeouts from 2008, at about 35% off list. Average price is $360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some winter-beater single speed/fixies, with all new components, for $190.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sizes cover riders from 5 fto 1 to 6 ft 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E-mail for info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tiny shop is helping to make Boston the fixed-gear capitol of America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Thoreau or Gandhi, we don't need Shimano's rotten, over-priced technology !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't need yuppies in spandex clown drag, riding high-end carbon bikes, to impress their suburban neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't need the WalMart lumpen-proletariat, riding their department-store junk, with those useless shocks and break-apart shifters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are cerebral Bostonians - Harvard, MIT, BU, BC, Northeastern, Wentworth, Berklee, MCA, UMass, Simmons, etc. We won't buy in to the bicycle industry's crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it Simple, Stupid. GO FIXIE !&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I had no idea Boston was working so hard to become America's fixed-gear capital, though I suppose it does make sense, since they do already have &lt;a href="http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?a=b&amp;amp;minisite=10029&amp;amp;spid=32823&amp;amp;language=US"&gt;their own Langster&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the city has realized that they're losing out on tourist dollars since so many people travel to places like Portland, San Francisco, and New York City to observe the latest fashions and visit their &lt;a href="http://www.chariandconyc.com/?id=home"&gt;ultra-chic fixed-gear boutiques&lt;/a&gt;. Then again, I'm not sure how many dollars we're talking about since the average fixed-gear tourist probably crashes on someone's couch, brings his own instant noodles, and spends about $27 during a week-long stay. But in these trying economic times every cent counts. And of course right now Boston's only attraction is the &lt;a href="http://www.cheersboston.com/pub/"&gt;real-life Cheers bar&lt;/a&gt;, and as exciting as that may be an entire generation of potential tourists is coming of age that knows nothing of Sam, Diane, Frasier, the Coach, Woody, Norm, Cliff the Mailman, and their poignantly funny antics. So I guess they're trying to pump up the "fixed-gear capitol" thing in order to invest in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad then goes on to evoke Thoreau and Gandhi, and this is where I start to get angry. First of all, Henry David Thoreau died in 1862, almost 60 years before Shimano was even founded. And while Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi lived until 1948 and could theoretically have had access to Shimano componentry, his feelings towards the company would not have been based on their technology; rather, they would have been complicated by the fact that, while Japan was a potential threat to India, Gandhi did not want to support Britain in the war effort unless India was granted total independence. His aversion was to choosing sides, not choosing gears. Really, Gandhi probably would have chosen to manufacture his own homespun bicycle components, and who's to say they wouldn't have included derailleurs? (Or that they wouldn't have come in four castes: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vayshia, and Sudra?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate fact is, neither Thoreau nor Gandhi lived to see Shimano innovations such as Hyperglide®, SLR® braking, and of course S.T.I.® shifting. I'm reasonably confident that if Thoreau and Gandhi were not only alive today but were also competitive cyclists that they would at least consider using Shimano components. (I'm also confident they would be the world's slowest but most interesting two-man time trial team.) Yes, I realize both men prized simplicity, but even a bike with a multi-speed drivetrain is extremely simple. The point isn't whether Thoreau would have ridden a singlespeed or a geared bike around Walden; it's that he probably would have chosen a bicycle over a four-wheeled ATV. Also, Shimano's "rotten, over-priced technology" does include track components and singlespeed freewheels and cogs, so I'm not really sure why they're being singled out here. If you really want to find "rotten, over-priced technology" you need to venture outside of the bicycle industry altogether. Have you tried to buy a razor lately?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having besmirched the memories of two great thinkers, the poster then moves on to both "yuppies in spandex clown drag" and the "WalMart lumpen-proletariat." Firstly, I'm not sure why "spandex clown drag" is any worse than the capri-pants-and-boat-shoes Audrey Hepburn-type drag that many fixed-gear riders choose to wear. Sure, they both look pretty silly, but at least the clown drag is moisture-wicking. More disturbing is the disdain for the "WalMart lumpen-proletariat." Notice the poster hates not only the bicycles but the riders themselves. Indeed, how dare they not be able to afford better bicycles? I'm surprised he didn't call their bikes "un-Carl Farbman-like." I'm also suprised he didn't call the riders themselves "Untermensch" because that's what he seems to be getting at here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, he is a "cerebral Bostonian" (he says "we" but I'm assuming it's the royal "we") with degrees from at least ten institutions of higher learning: "Harvard, MIT, BU, BC, Northeastern, Wentworth, Berklee, MCA, UMass, Simmons, etc." And as a cerebral Bostonian, he's refrained from the decidedly lumpen-proletariat and un-Carl Farbman-like "gears are for queers," and opted instead for the vastly more eloquent "Keep it Simple, Stupid. GO FIXIE!" This just goes to prove that there are few things more dangerous than a priveleged and immature person with an expensive education. It's like a novice rider on a 300lb motorcycle with a 1000cc engine: too much power and no ability to control it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, though, Boston is taking this "fixed-gear capitol" thing seriously. Another reader recently sent me this photo, which also appears to have been taken in Boston:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmW5M1IobI/AAAAAAAADrA/QByD7BaBHCg/s1600-h/gorilla+bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267407148627304882" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmW5M1IobI/AAAAAAAADrA/QByD7BaBHCg/s400/gorilla+bike.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yes, this rider is clearly adhering to the "keep it simple, stupid" philosophy. Instead of using a sensible frame, he's compensating for an extremely low front end by using a quill stem so tall it would make Grant Petersen blush. This is like kneeling on a stepladder, or turning the heat up instead of closing the window, or quieting your creaky bottom bracket by turning up your iPod. There's nothing simple about that. The rider also seems to have abandoned "rotten, over-priced technology" (such as brakes and bar tape) in favor of the much more sound and reasonably-priced Aerospoke technology. Best of all, there's a top tube pad, though considering the frame's geometry it would probably offer more crotchal protection on the stem. (There's certainly enough room for it anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Boston truly wants to become the fixed-gear capital, they're going to have to watch out for competition from overseas, where bike-mangling has been raised to &lt;a href="http://www.pedalmafia.com/bikecheck493.html"&gt;the level of an artform&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmUHgSvdiI/AAAAAAAADqA/-RdGv76aIaU/s1600-h/softride+fixie.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267404095835043362" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 342px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmUHgSvdiI/AAAAAAAADqA/-RdGv76aIaU/s400/softride+fixie.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it seems that the people at Pedal Mafia have also finally solved the problem of having to ride your fixed-gear.

But if they are real, they're dangerous. (And not only because 20- and 30-somethings are liable to place them in their mouths and choke on them.) Sure, at first it will just be a few fixters whiling away those snowy days by playing with their fixed-gear models at the bar. But then, when the ice melts and the trees start blooming, they'll find they've become so absorbed in trading and collecting that they've forgotten all about their full-sized bikes and how hard it can be to ride them. And it will only be a matter of time before they start incorporating &lt;a href="http://costumzee.com/view/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bratz.JPG"&gt;Bratz&lt;/a&gt; into their play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, though, I have no interest in playing with models of bicycles. I'd much rather ride the real thing. Unless they come out with fixed-gear tub toys, that is. Between that and my &lt;a href="http://www.wildelectronics.com.au/Bubble_Bath_Maker-p-16318.html"&gt;bubble bath machine&lt;/a&gt; I may never leave the lavatory again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/1036363761744356874/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=1036363761744356874' title='117 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/1036363761744356874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/1036363761744356874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/keep-it-simple-stupid-go-fixie.html' title='Keep It &lt;del&gt;Simple&lt;/del&gt;, Stupid: Go Fixie!'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRmWL0CFLeI/AAAAAAAADq4/AYaZ8XqW9xI/s72-c/Fixed+Gear_Single+Speed+Road+Bike.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>117</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-947969491889300569</id><published>2008-11-10T08:55:00.027-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-12T08:16:50.304-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='bike porn'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='bike theft'/><title type='text'>Letting it All Hang Out: Naked Riders, Vulnerable Bikes</title><content type='html'>As it grows colder (at least in the parts of the country that count), increasing numbers of cyclists will begin moving their training indoors. Personally, I'm against training. In fact, I feel that if you're against doping in cycling then you should be against training too. Some riders have access to more and better training, which in turn forces their competitors to attempt to match that training in order to level the field. In turn, the former riders seek out increasingly esoteric training methods to reclaim their advantage. The result is a cycle as vicious as it is dorky, and as anybody who's spent any time around bike racers knows, training (like drugs) can take a horrible toll on a person. Sure, training is much less likely to kill you than drugs are, but in large doses it is almost guaranteed to make you incredibly boring and unpleasant to be around. If I want to have fun, I'll ride my bike. But if I want to spend a lot of time around people who constantly monitor their bodies with electronics, can't drink alcohol, and go to bed early, I'll volunteer my time at a hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still insist on training, you can at least minimize the risks by sticking with more old-fashioned techniques. And few techniques are more old-fashioned than riding the rollers naked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRg9t7-eJQI/AAAAAAAADn4/pL8Hij-iQF4/s1600-h/naked+trainer+sepia.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267027623612916994" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 301px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRg9t7-eJQI/AAAAAAAADn4/pL8Hij-iQF4/s400/naked+trainer+sepia.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Please note that I've made this image safe for work by applying a t-shirt and a pair of cycling shorts.

Naked roller riding in front of a mirror has a number of advantages, chief among them being that it keeps you cool and it allows you to monitor both your technique and your body art. However, if you do plan to train &lt;em&gt;sans chamois&lt;/em&gt; you might want to consider staying both comfortable and sanitary by using a saddle cover. Also, think about getting a relevant set of knuckle tattoos for additional motivation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="middle"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.knuckletattoos.com/?utm_source=tattoogun&amp;amp;utm_medium=viral"&gt;&lt;img title="KnuckleTattoos.com" height="200" alt="SPINNUDE" src="http://www.knuckletattoos.com/gunCache/t_SPINNUDE.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;Get your own knuckles at &lt;a href="http://www.knuckletattoos.com/gun?utm_source=tattoogun&amp;amp;utm_medium=viral"&gt;the knuckle tattoo gun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might even consider applying the tattoo thusly so that it's legible in the mirror:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhm-FnOQEI/AAAAAAAADpo/RhdfyjXzp5Q/s1600-h/reverse+knuckle+tattoo.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267072981054406722" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 204px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhm-FnOQEI/AAAAAAAADpo/RhdfyjXzp5Q/s400/reverse+knuckle+tattoo.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the winter wears on and you inevitably grow tired of the sight of your own naked and tattoed body, consider getting a &lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bik/912549999.html"&gt;top tube-mounted mahogany iPod dock&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhByoq2OlI/AAAAAAAADoI/o60dLA306Ws/s1600-h/iphone+holder.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267032102376192594" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 128px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhByoq2OlI/AAAAAAAADoI/o60dLA306Ws/s400/iphone+holder.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ipod dock for bicycle (bk)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-09, 9:28PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;impress your pals with this handmade mahogany ipod touch dock. it has a cush inside and removable clip to securely hold your tunes. one of a kind. make me an offer or trade. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing classier and more impressive to pals than riding the rollers naked while staring at yourself in the mirror is riding the rollers naked while staring at yourself in the mirror and simultaneously entertaining yourself with a state-of-the-art handheld device ensconced in mahogany. Though I must say that the mahogany iPhone dock is the ugliest thing I've seen on a top tube since visiting the eminently unsafe-for-work &lt;a href="http://teabagsontoptubes.wordpress.com/"&gt;Teabags on Top Tubes&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the good people behind that site can get hold of one of these for testing (or &lt;em&gt;testi&lt;/em&gt;-ing). I understand the seller is also working on a Zune-compatible model which will be carved from a hunk of cheddar cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And stupid wooden boxes aren't the only thing you'll find on Craigslist. There's also been a tremendous surge of media interest on the subject of bike theft. In addition to &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQvFPBlaI/AAAAAAAADnQ/s-zRzsHTijU/s1600-h/EVER+HAD+YOUR+BIKE+STOLEN?.jpg"&gt;the call for stories we saw last week&lt;/a&gt;, here's &lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bik/910014600.html"&gt;a freelance journalist who wants to hear your tales of woe&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhCjUP0cPI/AAAAAAAADoQ/eclpR-gWFvo/s1600-h/HAVE+YOU+HAD+YOUR+BIKE+STOLEN?+I+WANT+TO+HEAR+ALL+ABOUT+IT..jpg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267032938707710194" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 80px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhCjUP0cPI/AAAAAAAADoQ/eclpR-gWFvo/s400/HAVE+YOU+HAD+YOUR+BIKE+STOLEN%3F+I+WANT+TO+HEAR+ALL+ABOUT+IT..jpg.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAVE YOU HAD YOUR BIKE STOLEN? I WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT. (NYC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Reply to: [deleted]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-07, 5:42PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi There,&lt;br /&gt;I am a freelance journalist and avid cyclist. I have had my bike stolen from me twice and let me tell you, it was a shocking and most vile experience. I have noticed more and more NYers rolling around the city and I am reluctant to rejoin their ranks because I was burned. Biking still remains an easy, efficient, pro-green and healthy-(if you don't get hit) mode of travel. The city is slowly doing their part to smooth out pot holes, create new bike lanes and some of them are even protected, but what are they doing about these bike thieves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of this ring true to you, or if you have a story to share, please send me an email.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reader Daddo pointed out in Friday's comments, the typical bike theft account generally consists of little more than "I came out of the Starbucks and turned left and it was gone!" However, I must admit that I am compelled by this journalist's claim that his own experiences with theft were "shocking and most vile." This indicates to me that there's a lot more to his story than a brief errand and a pair of bolt cutters, and I suspect that he may have been separated from his bicycle in a truly sordid manner. A reader recently informed me that &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bike-sexual&amp;amp;defid=3446841"&gt;the term bike-sexual has been inducted into the Urban Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps this journalist had infiltrated some kind of bike-sexual cult for a story by pretending to be one of them, only to be discovered and kept barely alive in a deep hole for months like in "Silence of the Lambs" while the bike-sexuals made perverse love with his bicycle and ultimately absconded with it. I can only hope he saw that other Craigslist ad and answered it, because if nothing else his story would surely make for compelling TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can speak with more certainty to his question about what New York City is doing about bike thieves. The answer, of course, is "nothing." Though in fairness to the city, I'd much rather they focus on stuff like potholes and bike lanes. Of all the problems cyclists in New York City face, theft is the one thing over which you have some measure of control in that you can actually make it difficult for someone to take your bike from you. Unfortunately, many people in New York and across the country still lock their bikes very poorly, and I continue to receive pictures from readers of low-hanging fruit. Here are just a few cautionary examples I've received recently:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRheFYlXGsI/AAAAAAAADpg/mbXl1R_EnT0/s1600-h/cleveland+lockup.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267063210801306306" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRheFYlXGsI/AAAAAAAADpg/mbXl1R_EnT0/s400/cleveland+lockup.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Seen on Fixedgeargallery, &lt;a href="http://www.fixedgeargallery.com/2008/nov/1/GregTerepkaPhotography.htm"&gt;this bike&lt;/a&gt; is secured using the cunning lock-over-the-bars technique. While looping something over something else might keep a rowboat from floating away, it's not going to keep your bike from getting stolen. Although in the rider's defense, I suppose working the lock past those incredibly dorky aero extensions might cost the thief a few more seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhDS1qO0KI/AAAAAAAADoY/tiWyImG67-I/s1600-h/handcuffed+bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267033755130712226" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 320px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhDS1qO0KI/AAAAAAAADoY/tiWyImG67-I/s400/handcuffed+bike.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a bike in Charottesville, VA locked up by the quick-release front wheel with a pair of novelty handcuffs. The only thing that might delay a thief here is deciding which is easier to open: the skewer or the handcuffs. Note the Bontrager vibration-damping bar plugs, which will ensure the thief's getaway is free from fatigue-inducing road buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhDixq_4VI/AAAAAAAADog/tkFHH0k3rl0/s1600-h/unlocked+lock.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267034028938092882" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhDixq_4VI/AAAAAAAADog/tkFHH0k3rl0/s400/unlocked+lock.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a drunk on his wedding night, this rider in Oakland, CA seems to have attempted to get it in but ultimately just given up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhEBOF7EoI/AAAAAAAADoo/W9DQAdsvU-s/s1600-h/water+pipe.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267034551963292290" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhEBOF7EoI/AAAAAAAADoo/W9DQAdsvU-s/s400/water+pipe.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Theft frequency varies from city to city, and locking jobs that are sufficient in one city can be insufficient in another. This bicycle was spotted in New York, NY and as such is completely indefensible. Even if the thief chooses not to saw through that electrical conduit for fear of electrocuting himself, both wheels are there for the taking. (Then again, they are Rolfs, which may be enough to render them inherently theftproof.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRh7CU8Gt_I/AAAAAAAADp4/6vAgUFqtdYk/s1600-h/canyon+lands.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267095044120557554" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRh7CU8Gt_I/AAAAAAAADp4/6vAgUFqtdYk/s400/canyon+lands.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But while even a New York thief might be able to resist a pair of Rolfs, you'd think no thief anywhere could possible resist a completely unsecured Full Force Canyon Lands with a u-lock dangling from the handlebars like a Euro pro's earring (as photographed by the proprietor of the &lt;a href="http://metalinquisition.blogspot.com/"&gt;Metal Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; blog). Yet amazingly, it remains. Perhaps that's because this is one of the few bicycles for which a pair of Rolfs could actually be considered an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhEu7eqjbI/AAAAAAAADo4/vfwf7PtrzIU/s1600-h/BikeLockOnHandleBars.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267035337240776114" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhEu7eqjbI/AAAAAAAADo4/vfwf7PtrzIU/s400/BikeLockOnHandleBars.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bike in Austin, TX (via the proprietor of &lt;a href="http://austinbikeblog.org/"&gt;austinbikeblog.org&lt;/a&gt;) remains as well. Perhaps New York is even worse than I thought and a lock hanging from the handlebars really is enough to keep your bike from getting stolen in the rest of the country. Kind of like putting a napkin on top of your drink when you step away from the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhHsb8cNjI/AAAAAAAADpA/X7UOtFGkHPU/s1600-h/madone+denver.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267038592950875698" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 320px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhHsb8cNjI/AAAAAAAADpA/X7UOtFGkHPU/s400/madone+denver.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that's why nobody's taken a pair of nail clippers and 20 seconds in order to liberate this flimsily-locked Madone in Denver, CO...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhIX1m6djI/AAAAAAAADpI/X-C_Vi7OTYQ/s1600-h/locked+to+each-other.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267039338574280242" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhIX1m6djI/AAAAAAAADpI/X-C_Vi7OTYQ/s400/locked+to+each-other.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ...or simply separated these two bikes in San Francisco, CA and dragged them away. Then again, I suppose this presents a conundrum to many San Franciscans, and it's not immediately apparent to them that the bikes are not actually attached to the pole. They're like a pair of Chinese linking rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhEaVzS8FI/AAAAAAAADow/iBkVRAUO8qc/s1600-h/mountain+pista.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267034983529377874" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 320px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhEaVzS8FI/AAAAAAAADow/iBkVRAUO8qc/s400/mountain+pista.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in its way, this image is the most vexing of all. Not because of the way it is locked, but because it may very well be photographic evidence of the only Bianchi Pista in the world to be equipped with a suspension fork. You'd think no lock on Earth would be strong enough to secure a technological marvel such as this. And it should come as no surprise that this bicycle was spotted at M.I.T., that school where all the smart people go. It clearly belongs to some mathematical genius like that guy from "A Beautiful Mind," and from the looks of it he's just moving into his paranoid and delusional stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of freaky bikes and doping, it seems that &lt;a href="http://velonews.com/article/84944/heras-wants-second-chance"&gt;Roberto Heras is having a hard time finding a team despite having served his suspension&lt;/a&gt;. Frankly, this is shocking to me, since a reader recently brought to my attention &lt;a href="http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/bike-blenheim-palace-a-big-success-18806"&gt;that Heras finished second in the 3rd Brompton World Championship&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhJRsKI3mI/AAAAAAAADpQ/XnrHfu4an1s/s1600-h/heras+brompton.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267040332470083170" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRhJRsKI3mI/AAAAAAAADpQ/XnrHfu4an1s/s400/heras+brompton.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional cycling is truly in a shambles when professional teams are not leaping to sign the runner-up in a folding bike race. I suppose it's only a matter of time before Michael Ball slithers out of his hole in order to claim him. In the meantime, Heras better get out of those clothes and onto the rollers if he's going to win next year's race. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/947969491889300569/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=947969491889300569' title='110 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/947969491889300569'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/947969491889300569'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/letting-it-all-hang-out-naked-riders.html' title='Letting it All Hang Out: Naked Riders, Vulnerable Bikes'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRg9t7-eJQI/AAAAAAAADn4/pL8Hij-iQF4/s72-c/naked+trainer+sepia.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>110</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-5555127261349700525</id><published>2008-11-07T09:28:00.026-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-07T13:59:31.130-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='singlespeed'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chris king'/><title type='text'>No Hope, No Pants: the CKHCI and the SSCXWC</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;I don't like to end the week on a negative note. Unfortunately though, I have no choice, because I believe in honesty before diplomacy. And the honest truth is that things are really, really bad. As you may remember, when I &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/no-getting-around-it-cycling-and.html"&gt;first started tracking the Chris King Headset Composite Index on October 27th, it was at 89.79&lt;/a&gt;. Just over a week later, on November 4th (Election Day here in the United States), it was at 67:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQqoLF7oI/AAAAAAAADnI/tz_V53lU46s/s1600-h/ckhci-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265922557571624578" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 161px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQqoLF7oI/AAAAAAAADnI/tz_V53lU46s/s400/ckhci-1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That's a 22.79 point drop in the CKHCI. If you've got an old box of tires and tubes lying around, I highly recommend boiling them, as the resulting broth is both high in nutrients and surprisingly tasty. It's also what you'll be subsisting on when society comes to a grinding halt and we all start living a real-life version of Cormac McCarthy's "The Road," except with bicycles instead of shopping carts. Actually, it will probably be more like a combination of "The Road" and "&lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/anywhere-anytime-cycling-and-mobility.html"&gt;Red Dawn&lt;/a&gt;," with elements of the "Mad Max" movies thrown in for good measure. It also goes without saying that many of us will resort to cannibalism, not only for sustenance but also to keep our bicycles working. Think bar tape made from human flesh, lubricants of blood, and drivechains of bone. Yes, I know it's horrible to contemplate, but we're not going to survive if we can't face the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if numbers and graphic imagery won't convince you, perhaps Poorly-Rendered Graphing Technology (PRGT) will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRlRlDfCMI/AAAAAAAADnY/PjNIg1PjTjA/s1600-h/ckhci+a.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265945216981862594" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 223px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRlRlDfCMI/AAAAAAAADnY/PjNIg1PjTjA/s400/ckhci+a.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, to put it another way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRn7KVTb3I/AAAAAAAADng/EEri1Mztr1Y/s1600-h/ckhci+b.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265948130386603890" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 226px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRn7KVTb3I/AAAAAAAADng/EEri1Mztr1Y/s400/ckhci+b.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What's more, these aren't freakish 1 1/4" headsets, like we saw &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQr82doevzI/AAAAAAAADgg/cefRa35jH6w/s1600-h/ckhci.jpg"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;.  These are 1 1/8" ones, and they're in good condition, too.  The one that went for $51 is "still butttttterrrrr smooth," according to the seller.  Sure, it may have had "a very light, faint perfect circle line" from installation,  but it was also in a Moots frame, which should count for something.  (After all, they have "&lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/dizzying-heights-popping-road-bike.html"&gt;meticulous Moots welds&lt;/a&gt;.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the only thing wrong with the $60 one (besides one "minor abrasion") was that it was missing the Chris King top cap.  Now, we all know that Chris King is famous for their precision and tight tolerances, which is why they charge &lt;a href="http://chrisking.com/parts/spacers"&gt;$30 for their headset spacers&lt;/a&gt;.  (Just try going back to normal spacers after using the Kings.  You might as well use the cardboard cylinder from a roll of toilet paper.)  So it would stand to reason that their top caps also set headset preload with a degree of accuracy no other top cap can approach.  Still, the seller has compensated for this by supplying two--&lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;--non-Chris King top caps, one of which even espouses a non-homophibic affinity for singlespeed bicycles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQko_cGqI/AAAAAAAADnA/tfsQjDlejk0/s1600-h/ck.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265922454711966370" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 163px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQko_cGqI/AAAAAAAADnA/tfsQjDlejk0/s400/ck.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Alas, the only conclusion I can draw from this is that we're all doomed.  Cyclists everywhere are no doubt pounding the Chris King headsets out of their frames and liquidating them before the bottom drops out completely.  In the meantime, they're almost certainly replacing them with cheaper headsets, which probably means the price of cheap headses will increase.  So as the price of King headsets drops and the price of "inferior" headsets goes up, we will see the dreaded "headset price inversion scenario," which I'm pretty sure is also what caused the rampant inflation in Weimar Germany in the 1920s.  And as we all know, things didn't go so well after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of singlespeed-specific top caps (never, ever use a singlespeed-specific top cap on a geared bicycle by the way), this weekend will see the running of the &lt;a href="http://sscxwc.com/"&gt;Single Speed Cyclocross World Championships&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not even going to bother mentioning where the SSCXWC is being held since it should be obvious.  But if you still need help, let's just say it's someplace moist and bike-friendly.  (And don't mean Mario Cipollini's crotchal region, though I hear they may hold it there next year.)  And if there are two things singlespeeders love, it's ironic world championships and gender-bending.  Here's the winner of last year's men's race, Barry Wicks, wearing the SSCXWC "golden speedo" (otherwise known as the &lt;em&gt;hamac de banane d'or&lt;/em&gt;) at the regular non-cyclocross-specific SSWC in Napa, CA this past August:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRSDAp4aB6I/AAAAAAAADno/vnuc3Tk3Rgc/s1600-h/wicks.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRSDAp4aB6I/AAAAAAAADno/vnuc3Tk3Rgc/s400/wicks.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265977911568631714" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We truly live in a, well, golden age of irony when a professional cyclist can wear the disgustingly revealing bikini he won at one ironic world championship while competing in another.  And while wearing a golden speedo isn't necessarily crossdressing, I do think it's noteworthy that so many competitive male cyclists will seize upon even the slightest opportunity to wear women's clothing.  Apart from the SSWC, in which a sizable portion of the male competitors wore skirts, there are also such things as the &lt;a href="http://cxmagazine.com/cross-dressing-training-series"&gt;Urban Outlaw Cyclocross Dress Series&lt;/a&gt;.  Frankly, I don't have a good explanation for this behavior, nor for why it's especially popular on the West Coast.  I suppose it's some combination of being unable to resist the "cross" double entendre, deeply repressed desires bubbling to the surface in the pressure cooker of competition, and wanting to sneak into &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ9VMJpEYI/AAAAAAAADmw/r2gyjdotO-o/s1600-h/time_s+up+detail.jpg"&gt;restricted bicycle repair clinics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In any event, those of us stuck on the East Coast must find more prosaic ways to entertain ourselves, since we're too busy dealing with the harsh realities of life to frolic in the mud while wearing women's underpants.  (Instead, we toil in the mud while wearing skinsuits.)  So if you live on the serious side of the country and you don't have the time or inclination to participate in one of the unironic cyclocross races happening in your area, you can at least &lt;a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tfr/904849107.html"&gt;share the misery of having your bicycle stolen with a television production company&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQvFPBlaI/AAAAAAAADnQ/s-zRzsHTijU/s1600-h/EVER+HAD+YOUR+BIKE+STOLEN?.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265922634092221858" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 129px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRRQvFPBlaI/AAAAAAAADnQ/s-zRzsHTijU/s400/EVER+HAD+YOUR+BIKE+STOLEN%3F.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;EVER HAD YOUR BIKE STOLEN?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt; (Downtown)&lt;br /&gt;Reply to: job-904849107@craigslist.org [?]&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2008-11-03, 9:06PM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a great story to tell about a stolen bike, we want to hear it!

So if you've got a good story to tell, send us a few sentences describing what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to include your name, phone number, and email – and send us a picture of yourself if you've got one. Also let us know when you are available this Friday and Saturday (the more options you give us, the better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be shooting downtown this Friday (11/7) and Saturday (11/8), probably around Union Square or Tompkins Square Park. It will only take twenty minutes or so to film you telling your story. If you ended up getting your bike back, bring it so you can show it off! Or bring a new one if you have one.

In actual practice though I have never seen a disabled person--or in fact any person--either board or disembark from an Access-a-Ride bus. This is because it is nearly impossible to get within 50 yards of an Access-a-Ride bus without losing your life as they are driven by Berserkers and are more dangerous than a thousand cabbies. It's like the MTA freebased a bus and put the driver on a mescaline IV drip. Recently I was almost hit by one making an illegal u-turn and the driver yelled at &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's no wonder that I was so happy to see one finally being interdicted by the authorities. Of course, I'm sure the officers didn't actually summons the driver or place him under arrest. They probably just chided him and explained that he really shouldn't pass school buses on the right when they're discharging children, especially if he needs to go onto the sidewalk in order to do it. Still, it's an encouraging sign. (Though I confess I was hoping the officer would &lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2008/10/24/cops_accused_of_sodomizing_brooklyn.php"&gt;reach for his radio&lt;/a&gt;--and not to call for backup.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you don't have to drive an Access-a-Ride bus to be a raging idiot. Just this very morning, as I traveled along treacherous streets strewn with wet autumn leaves, I got stuck behind a Volkswagen driving in the bike lane. Now, I should admit that I'm prejudiced against Nissans and Volkswagens. I'm not sure why that is. Perhaps it's because in New York Nissans seem always to be driven by the kinds of people who customize them with those idiotic retina-searing blue xenon headlights and hang CDs from their rear-view mirrors, and Volkswagens seem to appeal to the sorts of people who only buy products that are promoted by clever ad campaigns and don't know how to operate a fuel pump themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now ordinarily I might have said something nasty to the driver, or even gone so far as to close the car's foldable side-view mirror to allow myself to pass. (For some reason, this always renders people apoplectic, despite the fact that their mirrors are designed to close and it seems much better for both of us than smashing into it because they cut me off.) Instead, despite my prejudice--or perhaps because of it--I resolved to be polite. At the next light I approached the driver and nicely told her that she had been driving in the bike lane for the last three blocks. She was wearing a leather jacket that was a few sizes too tight, she had aggressively ironed and highlighted hair with lots of product in it (the highlights matched the jacket), and she had lots of skin care product and make-up smeared upon herself as well, giving her entire person the appearance of having been dipped in lacquer. Had I poured a bottle of water on her, it almost certainly would have beaded as though she had been Scotch-guarded. "Thank you for telling me," she replied nicely. And that, I thought, was that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally though, when the light changed she stayed in the bike lane, this time following me. At the next light I turned around to find she was still there, and I gave her a sarcastic "thumbs up," which she sarcastically returned (her moisturized thumb left a greasy smudge on her windshield), and then we just sat there glowering at each-other until the light changed again. Resolved not to lapse into anger and resigned to the fact that any further action on my part would be futile, I simply went on my way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, there's a water table of anger in the city, and it's often very high. If the encounter had devolved into an altercation, she would have probably just cut off or honked angrily at the next cyclist she came across. Our fight would have been like a heavy rain, an overflow of anger would have been the result, and it almost certainly would have flooded some other peoples' basements as well. Then again, she was an idiot, and she probably just cut off or honked angrily at the next cyclist she came across anyway. And I certainly cut off a few Nissans and Volkswagens on purpose after encountering her. So maybe it doesn't matter. After all, she doesn't have to worry about flooding, since she is completely waterproofed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, cyclists and motorists both have a lot of anger. And as we've seen, increasing numbers of cyclists are choosing to vent their anger on their rims. This bicycle was recently spotted in San Francisco by a reader:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ4Ulu-TII/AAAAAAAADmQ/2Iv2BlPOonc/s1600-h/f+you.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265403209471380610" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ4Ulu-TII/AAAAAAAADmQ/2Iv2BlPOonc/s400/f+you.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If the beloved &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/R_5tFHW0prI/AAAAAAAAB-4/YWb6ZKvtFTY/s1600-h/haters-1.jpg"&gt;AYHSMB&lt;/a&gt; rim was a Shakespearean sonnet, this "Fuck You" rim is at best a dirty limerick. The beauty of the AYHSMB rim is that, while it's certainly angry and not a little bit vulgar, its anger and vulgarity is channeled towards a specific group of people: haters. You can overlook the vulgarity because it connects with its target so accurately. It leaves the bystander staring with admiration rather than feeling besmirched himself. On the other hand, the "Fuck You" rim is like a nail bomb in that it offends indiscriminately. "Fuck who?" "You." That's it. It insults the innocent as well as the guilty. Even small children and the elderly are liable to be wounded by its schrapnel. It's an ugly act of terrorism as opposed to an eloquent exhortation to ball sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there's &lt;a href="http://velospace.org/node/14817"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, forwarded by another reader:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ49v-xhCI/AAAAAAAADmY/US6w17EY1a0/s1600-h/fckyocouch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265403916596642850" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ49v-xhCI/AAAAAAAADmY/US6w17EY1a0/s400/fckyocouch.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This "F*ck Yo Couch" downtube message is obviously an homage to &lt;a href="http://www.pp2g.tv/vYnt6YXQ_.aspx"&gt;the famous "Chappelle's Show" skit&lt;/a&gt;, though it's even more compelling if one considers it outside of that context. It then becomes a bold expression of independence, in that the owner has probably been living on a friend or relative's couch for years while saving the money to build up his bike. And now that the bike is finished, he can finally move on and seek his own couch. Perhaps he can even dare to dream and start pricing futons. (In the furniture heirarchy, a futon is higher than just a couch, though it is lower than having both a couch and a bed.) The "F*ck Yo Couch" message is offensive, true, but the owner has shown restraint by censoring the "F*ck." Also, it's less an insult than it is an expression of exuberance, since he's finally free from his host's draconian couch-related rules, such as not to eat potato chips on it, not to spill bong water on it, and to surrender the remote and vacate the couch when his host's girlfriend wants to watch "Gossip Girl."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, though, not all frame-borne messages are this eloquent. Recently--on the fixedgeargallery no less--I was dismayed to see &lt;a href="http://www.fixedgeargallery.com/2008/oct/2/GayleLutz.htm"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ83VMf73I/AAAAAAAADmo/50s99nUdEUw/s1600-h/gearsareforqueers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265408204373749618" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ83VMf73I/AAAAAAAADmo/50s99nUdEUw/s400/gearsareforqueers.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is not the first time we've seen &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/down-with-gears-or-down-with-gears.html"&gt;anti-gearism&lt;/a&gt;, nor is it the first time we've seen &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQcDZZbFMtI/AAAAAAAADeI/G8fKtvCr_mE/s1600-h/fagget+ass+hipsters.jpg"&gt;fixed-gear homophobia&lt;/a&gt; (though I did attempt to &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/mallrats-where-trends-go-to-die.html"&gt;debunk the homophobia&lt;/a&gt;). Frankly, it's upsetting to see that the segment of the cycling world that presents itself as the most countercultural so often adopts the most reactionary views. Then again, we are talking about fixed-gear riders, so it is possible this is meant ironically. Perhaps the orange axle monster is a form of puncuation. It could be that just like "!" means the sentence is an exclamation and "?" means the sentence is a question, a rubber orange monster means the sentence is ironic. Language is evolving, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that's evolving is brake lever placement. A reader recently forwarded me this photo of a downtube-mounted brake lever (or a "DTMBL"), spotted in Davis, CA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ3vPiBfXI/AAAAAAAADmI/pLDcRnB5fhU/s1600-h/dtmbl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265402567856323954" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ3vPiBfXI/AAAAAAAADmI/pLDcRnB5fhU/s400/dtmbl.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've seen the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/03/fixedgeargalleryof-ttmbls.html"&gt;TTMBL&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2007/11/velospace-keeping-hopelessness-alive.html"&gt;SPMBL&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008_08_01_archive.html"&gt;FMBL&lt;/a&gt;, but this is definitely something new. It appears that this lever has been mounted to the water bottle boss. I have to admit I'm impressed, because it's rare you see such a sublime combination of ingenuity and stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when it comes to cycling and intolerance, there is hope. Recently, I traveled along the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/no-getting-around-it-cycling-and.html"&gt;Great Hipster Silk Route&lt;/a&gt; to the dreaded neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn for a social engagement. (Nobody wants to socialize with me, but people do want to socialize with other people who are close to me, so sometimes I'm accidentally included.) I fastened my bike to a pole, and when I came out this was taped to it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ8prSGbXI/AAAAAAAADmg/2XUEqii7OIc/s1600-h/time"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265407969784655218" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 310px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ8prSGbXI/AAAAAAAADmg/2XUEqii7OIc/s400/time%27s+up.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Actually, that's not true. It was taped to the bike belonging to the person I was with. In fact, they hit every bike in the neighborhood but mine. (Like its owner, I guess the IOJB screams "Do Not Touch!") This event in particular caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ9VMJpEYI/AAAAAAAADmw/r2gyjdotO-o/s1600-h/time_s+up+detail.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265408717341921666" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 391px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ9VMJpEYI/AAAAAAAADmw/r2gyjdotO-o/s400/time_s+up+detail.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;While adding "trans" seems inclusive at first glance, upon further consideration I think it's unnecessary. If they're truly inclusive, then surely they consider transsexual women to be women, and so it's implicit that transsexual women are invited. Then again, maybe they mean that the class is open to women (both genetic and transsexual) as well as to female-to-male transsexuals. In other words, anybody but plain old genetic men, who as we all know hate the twin evils of gears and gays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, all I know is I can't go, and that political correctness is just as confusing as homophobic slogans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/1917139314378613632/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=1917139314378613632' title='94 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/1917139314378613632'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/1917139314378613632'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/indignity-of-commuting-by-bicycle-anger.html' title='The Indignity of Commuting by Bicycle: Anger and Intolerance'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRJ20EhYu1I/AAAAAAAADmA/JLkzQ_kIIa8/s72-c/access-a-ride+busted.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>94</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4213956784784062266.post-5351724801285122405</id><published>2008-11-05T09:12:00.026-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-05T14:05:35.720-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='commuting by bicycle'/><title type='text'>From the BSNYC Culture Desk (Part II): Free DVDs!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;As the world watched an historic election unfold, a different scenario played itself out in the alternate reality that is this blog:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGrfmG4G_I/AAAAAAAADlY/BjbJP9c3qxg/s1600-h/poll.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177998666505202" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 230px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 245px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGrfmG4G_I/AAAAAAAADlY/BjbJP9c3qxg/s400/poll.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as of this morning, with 90% of precincts reporting it looks like Ralph Nader and his running-mate, the Swiffer® WetJet® All-In-One Power Mop, have taken a narrow victory:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRHBANJLoCI/AAAAAAAADlo/t01Ta0VZfZ8/s1600-h/nader+swiffer.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265201648645152802" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 194px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRHBANJLoCI/AAAAAAAADlo/t01Ta0VZfZ8/s400/nader+swiffer.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Nader could not deliver a victory speech, as he was on the set of a new buddy comedy called "Click It or Ticket" in which he co-stars with Martin Lawrence. (And I'm not going to spoil it by telling you which one will be wearing the fat suit.) But if you saw the speech I'm sure you'll agree the Swiffer was eloquent enough for the both of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRHAD4vL8UI/AAAAAAAADlg/KZ3GrjpXOPQ/s1600-h/swiffer+speech.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265200612375261506" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 369px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 261px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRHAD4vL8UI/AAAAAAAADlg/KZ3GrjpXOPQ/s400/swiffer+speech.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's truly inspiring when you consider that we are one botched stunt away (Nader always performs his own stunts) from being governed by a household appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, I recently received an email from a real live publicist, who informed me that the New York City PBS affiliate WNET would be showing back-to-back episodes of the series "&lt;a href="http://www.e2-series.com/"&gt;e2&lt;/a&gt;" on November 6th. One of these episodes, "Paris: Vélo Liberté," is narrated by Brad Pitt and is about the Vélib bike-sharing program, and apparently screener copies were available on request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't know about you, but when I hear the words "Brad Pitt" and "PBS" used together, I pay attention. And when I also hear "bikes" and "free DVD" I know I've just stumbled onto something big. Not only that, but I'm very interested in bike-sharing, since I am the inventor of the "&lt;a href="http://kwallblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/take-pista-leave-pista.html"&gt;Take a Pista, Leave a Pista&lt;/a&gt;" program. So naturally I requested the DVD, which I watched with interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I have two requirements when watching anything that has to do with France. Firstly, I need to see the Eiffel Tower immediately. Secondly, there had better be baguettes. So I'm pleased to report that not only did the episode open with this tantalizing "up the skirt" shot of everybody's favorite antenna:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGrTf6UtcI/AAAAAAAADlI/cbakdYgAqUQ/s1600-h/e2+title.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177790844810690" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 226px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGrTf6UtcI/AAAAAAAADlI/cbakdYgAqUQ/s400/e2+title.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there was also a baguette in a bicycle basket:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGrND0hSiI/AAAAAAAADlA/UztS5Ga5fpI/s1600-h/avec+baguette+a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177680225061410" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 222px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGrND0hSiI/AAAAAAAADlA/UztS5Ga5fpI/s400/avec+baguette+a.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As well as &lt;em&gt;sur la table&lt;/em&gt; in a spartan kitchen and accompanied by olive oil and wine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGq9W1SelI/AAAAAAAADk4/mQnyETLMN3s/s1600-h/baguette.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177410450651730" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 222px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGq9W1SelI/AAAAAAAADk4/mQnyETLMN3s/s400/baguette.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sufficiently convinced that I was watching something authentic and authoritative, I allowed myself to pay more attention. With the help of city officials and people involved in the Vélib program, Brad Pitt explained that Paris has recently begun taking away space from cars and giving it to other forms of transit, and that the plan is to cut traffic 40% by 2020. Obviously, Vélib is a part of this, and it's become the largest and most successful bike-sharing program in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGq4Fz4X2I/AAAAAAAADkw/tfeSRSstwr8/s1600-h/velib+station.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177319981997922" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 226px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGq4Fz4X2I/AAAAAAAADkw/tfeSRSstwr8/s400/velib+station.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the way it works is that you pay a modest subscription fee, and you can then use the bikes free for the first half-hour.  This is to encourage the kinds of short trips Parisians tend to make, such as going to the market to purchase baguettes and cigarettes, picking up their corduroy sports jackets from the dry cleaners, and cheating on their spouses or life partners.  Once you go past a half hour, you're charged, and the charge increases exponentially.  While this is a good thing in that it keeps Vélib turnover high, I would imagine it has also taken a bit of the passion out of aldulterous liaisons since visiting lovers are no doubt reluctant to go past the half-hour mark.  Here we see what very well could be a frugal sex partner rushing to the nearest Vélib station after a truncated rendez-vous:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqyigbVqI/AAAAAAAADko/4J4S1RnAR0c/s1600-h/velib+rider.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177224605816482" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 222px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqyigbVqI/AAAAAAAADko/4J4S1RnAR0c/s400/velib+rider.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And efficient copulating followed by quick riding isn't always enough to save you money.  Apparently the fine for running a light in Paris is €90 (which even at the falling exchange rate is still almost $4,000):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqs9fk2JI/AAAAAAAADkg/ssYyTLFNTl8/s1600-h/ticket.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265177128770787474" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 225px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqs9fk2JI/AAAAAAAADkg/ssYyTLFNTl8/s400/ticket.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bikes themselves, it seems the program's architects faced a significant challenge in convincing people that riding a bicycle is not a symbol of lowered social status, and that the Vélib is not their "grandpa's bicycle."  At the same time, they also had to design something durable that could be ridden by a variety of people day after day.  Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/366337/ride-the-bitchcruiser-bike-but-wear-protection-nsfw"&gt;their original design&lt;/a&gt; was already taken, hence the appearance of the Vélib as it is now.  Of course, it may seem ironic that the host country of the world's most famous bicycle race has to persuade its citizens that they won't look foolish on a bicycle.  Then again, when it comes to the Tour the French have mostly been pack fodder since like 1985.  Also, road cycling isn't always pretty--even in Paris:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqnaUooAI/AAAAAAAADkY/yJaXfIv3OJo/s1600-h/roadie.jpg"&gt;&lt;img

{parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqhnIjNvI/AAAAAAAADkQ/aVtsWFXn0u8/s1600-h/bikes.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265176933790070514" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 224px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt=""

and not the rider.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that one of the few problems with the Vélib program is that people generally don't return bicycles to stations that are situated on hills, since Parisians only want to ride down hills and not up them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqbjDXowI/AAAAAAAADkI/V0F8NT3GL8Y/s1600-h/hills.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265176829615383298" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 221px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqbjDXowI/AAAAAAAADkI/V0F8NT3GL8Y/s400/hills.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that the hilltop stations need to be replenished via truck.  I found this interesting in that this innate aversion to climbing might very well explain why the French perform so poorly at the Tour.  To address this problem, Vélib planners will soon start giving riders who return their bikes to hill stations 15 free minutes.  Not only will this serve as an incentive to climb, but over time it will probably also restore the French to Tour greatness thanks to these frugality-inspired hill repeats.  Beyond that, the better climbers will almost certainly use their 15 free minutes for their sexual liaisons, which means that these liaisons will be more likely to result in pregnancy, which in turn means that the next generation of French people will probably be great climbers.  So I would expect a long streak of French Tour wins starting in around 2030.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you're wondering how these bikes are maintained, at least some of them are serviced on a bike shop barge that travels up and down the Seine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqWuQ_ShI/AAAAAAAADkA/gUF08yCOF1M/s1600-h/floating+bike+shop.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265176746725952018" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that a floating bike shop is a "brilliant idea not to be missed," and it's also a great argument for having a full-blown bike-sharing program here in New York City.  After all, we New Yorkers are an island people (mostly) and there's water everywhere.  I often fantasize about being a seafaring bike shop proprietor, complete with a tri-corner hat, eye patch, and a parrot who repeats my &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;bon mots&lt;/span&gt;.   In fact, most of the &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/no-getting-around-it-cycling-and.html"&gt;Great Hipster Silk Route&lt;/a&gt; travels along the East River.  I smell something, and that smell is opportunity (with a hint of low tide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it would appear that Parisians are making great strides in reclaiming their streets from excessive motor vehicle traffic.  Unfortunately, one of those strides apparently includes something called "Friday Night Fever," which is kind of like Critical Mass on rollerblades:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqPg9u6wI/AAAAAAAADj4/GYmORFI7wPA/s1600-h/friday+night+fever.jpg"&gt;&lt;img

becoming big pick-up spots:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SRGqHkXHWuI/AAAAAAAADjw/w3vtqKnz2JI/s1600-h/pickup+scene-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265176486369254114" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disinclined to believe this, since it was Brad Pitt who was making this claim, and while a woman at a Vélib station might enjoy being hit on by a movie star she'd probably just hit a regular person with her baguette.  But then they interviewed some goofy French comedian who corroborated Pitt's claim, so there you go.  Just remember, though, that while the first half-hour is free some of those STDs can last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, it was pretty interesting and since PBS is free you might as well check it out tomorrow night.  (It's on at 9:30PM, at least here in New York.)  And while we don't have a full-blown bike-sharing program here in New York we are getting more protected bike lanes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a

with strong drink, don my voting smock, and undertake the long and difficult journey to my polling place.  As such, I will return tomorrow with regular updates.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I strongly believe nobody should be disenfranchised (even if they're from some other country) so if you're unable to vote for President because you're a non-US citizen, under 18 years old, a convicted felon, or any combination thereof, you can still experience the thrill of voting by using my Virtual Election Simulator below.  And it's even better than the real thing, because not only can you mix and match candidates, but you can also vote as many times as you want:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;embed allowscriptaccess="never" saveembedtags="true"

of people emailed me photos of unretired professional cyclist, cancer activist, &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/01/apoca-watch-update-retirees-on-tall.html"&gt;tall bike enthusiast&lt;/a&gt;, and reformed marathon runner Lance Armstrong at the Tour de Gruene. The Tour de Gruene is a time trial in Gruene, Texas, which also (according to its &lt;a href="http://www.tourdegruene.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) features "oompah bands, lederhosen, and abundant Bavarian food and drink." Armstrong is a noted fan of oompah music (he has been known to sit in occasionally with an Austin band called the Oompah-Loompas), and he's also riddent the Tour de Gruene in the past, so it was no surprise to find him there. The big question on everybody's lips, though, was of course: "Will Armstrong wear lederhosen this time?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one was hopeful, so I was excited to see the photos. Here we see Armstrong emerging tentatively from his car, checking for photographers. (Apart from the nutjob with the camcorder in the grassy knoll and the person who took the actual photo, the coast appears to be clear:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8GxZXbglI/AAAAAAAADjo/NigZm-QOCLU/s1600-h/la+1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264433935111914066" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8GxZXbglI/AAAAAAAADjo/NigZm-QOCLU/s400/la+1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(Photo by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:c_jacobs2609@yahoo.com"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Chrissie Rosetta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we see him outside of the vehicle, but still hiding behind the door. At this point I was sure he was wearing lederhosen but that he was still feeling a bit self-conscious about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Gt7MMy9I/AAAAAAAADjg/VRw1JQJqTvE/s1600-h/la+2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264433875472141266" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Gt7MMy9I/AAAAAAAADjg/VRw1JQJqTvE/s400/la+2.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(Photo by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:c_jacobs2609@yahoo.com"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Chrissie Rosetta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, though, Armstrong (emboldened by the distant sounds of his beloved oompah music perhaps) summoned the courage to show himself. Unfortunately, though, he wasn't wearing lederhosen at all. He was just wearing some crappy t-shirt:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Gp7gD5gI/AAAAAAAADjY/23cQQuVibPg/s1600-h/la+3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264433806835967490" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Gp7gD5gI/AAAAAAAADjY/23cQQuVibPg/s400/la+3.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(Photo by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:c_jacobs2609@yahoo.com"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Chrissie Rosetta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only possible explanation for Armstrong's clothing choice is that it was laundry day, and when he opened his t-shirt drawer all that was left was this one and his old &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SE0v0dzMVaI/AAAAAAAACbU/TRlaZnQvFcg/s1600-h/letle+viride.jpg"&gt;Letle Viride&lt;/a&gt; World Tour '89 raglan tee with the hole dangerously close to the nipple area. Also, judging from the sunglasses and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=6764&amp;amp;l=5257a&amp;amp;id=1430148431"&gt;the rest of the photos&lt;/a&gt;, which show Armstrong hanging with Steve Hed, I wouldn't be surprised if they were both coming straight off an all-nighter at &lt;a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/shades-of-marketing-art-of-salesmanship.html"&gt;Shane Stock's house&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, he only had a few moments to collect himself before&lt;a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/about_us/express-news/slideshows/Lance_Armstrong_Tour_de_Gruene.html?c=y&amp;amp;page=10"&gt; the autograph hounds came&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8FxwzoMCI/AAAAAAAADjQ/Mdx0oRFI6vQ/s1600-h/la+in+smock.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264432841892573218" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 266px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8FxwzoMCI/AAAAAAAADjQ/Mdx0oRFI6vQ/s400/la+in+smock.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidetally, Armstrong did win both the ITT and the TTT, though with regard to his ITT victory &lt;a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2008/nov08/nov03news"&gt;he said he was only "moderately pleased" and that he "wasn't ecstatic."&lt;/a&gt; I like to think that the shirt confered upon him the power to find something negative in a positive situation. After all, that is how I approach my own endeavors. When life gives some people lemons, they make lemonade, but when life gives me delicious ripe oranges I squeeze the citric acid out of them and pour it into my eyes. Though I will say I was pleased to see Armstrong racing his bike this weekend instead of running the New York City marathon. Even if he didn't race in lederhosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of disappointment, last night was the New York City premiere of &lt;a href="http://www.macaframaproductions.com/"&gt;Macaframa&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to attend. If you don't know what Macaframa means, I can't help you, because I still don't know. All I know is it's a highly stylized movie in which people in subtly different outfits ride their fixed-gear bicycles around San Francisco to musical accompaniment. I'd been seeing snippets from this movie for many months now, so when I learned it would be shown in my own hometown I figured it was my responsibility to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to a place called Arlo and Esme on East. 1st Street in Mahattan, which &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/arlo_and_esme_coffee_by_day_co.html"&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/arlo_and_esme_coffee_by_day_co.html"&gt; says offers "coffee by day and coffee cocktails at night."&lt;/a&gt; Personally, I like my cocktails without any coffee, and I like them day or night, so I was already concerned. The &lt;a href="http://www.bikeblognyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/macaframanyc.jpg"&gt;flyer for the event&lt;/a&gt; had said "first come first serve," so I did my best to get there late in hopes that I might be turned away. My hopes were bolstered by the fact that the entire block was encrusted with fixed-gear bicycles like barnacles on a jetty:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Bp0AAcAI/AAAAAAAADhg/6oqv6RQkfdg/s1600-h/bikes+on+1st+a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264428307264335874" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Bp0AAcAI/AAAAAAAADhg/6oqv6RQkfdg/s400/bikes+on+1st+a.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closer I got to the venue, the more severe the bicycle-clumping became:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8B5ORg1fI/AAAAAAAADhw/8eda4c6NHsQ/s1600-h/bike+pile.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264428572015121906" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 208px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8B5ORg1fI/AAAAAAAADhw/8eda4c6NHsQ/s400/bike+pile.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In urban fixed-gear terminology, this is what's known as a "bike carbuncle:"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Bv5i_egI/AAAAAAAADho/_Ivr9TZ4LQQ/s1600-h/bike+pile+a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264428411832465922" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8Bv5i_egI/AAAAAAAADho/_Ivr9TZ4LQQ/s400/bike+pile+a.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my horror, they were even hanging from the trees:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8CDPJgxqI/AAAAAAAADh4/aEfLfMzB0SI/s1600-h/bikes+in+tree.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264428744048690850" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8CDPJgxqI/AAAAAAAADh4/aEfLfMzB0SI/s400/bikes+in+tree.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, despite the fact that the venue was obviously going to be packed, I was granted access. (A bouncer duly checked my driver's license, which I have cunningly amended to fool people into thinking I'm actually over 21.) I made my way downstairs just as the film began and took my place at the back of the crowd, where I hoped not to attract any attention. (In an attempt at disguising myself, I was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and I hadn't showered since participating in a cyclocross race the day before):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8CceZTwoI/AAAAAAAADiA/SHiG8Gumnbc/s1600-h/crowd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264429177638208130" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8CceZTwoI/AAAAAAAADiA/SHiG8Gumnbc/s400/crowd.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the poor vantage point, I could see enough to determine that this was no ordinary fixed-gear movie. Indeed, it was actually an ordinary fixed-gear movie with a much higher quotient of 60s and 70s rock music than I had expected. And while "Venus in Furs" by the Velvet Underground isn't exactly the sort of music you'd expect to accompany aggressive urban fixed-gear riding, it did work with the San Francisco gingerbread-house backdrop, as well as with the frequent shots of clouds and waving alfalfa fields or whatever they were. Bemused, I sought a slightly better vantage point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8ClRKBu3I/AAAAAAAADiI/UYtZPfTFegY/s1600-h/stage+right.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264429328703273842" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8ClRKBu3I/AAAAAAAADiI/UYtZPfTFegY/s400/stage+right.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, I could see pretty well from here, but despite this, I began to grow a bit bored. Firstly, while some might find watching people ride down steep San Francisco hills on brakeless fixed-gear bikes thrilling, I find it kind of ridiculous. The frantic spinning coupled with the upright position (short stems are the new long stems) of most of the riders makes high-speed riding look comical--it's like watching old-timey baseball footage. Secondly, while I'm not particularly impressed by most fixed-gear trick riding, I'm completely sick of &lt;a href="http://hkfixed.blogspot.com/2007/09/leg-over-bar.html"&gt;those goofy elephant trunk leg-over-the-bar skids&lt;/a&gt;, and this movie has them in abundance. They're like the PBR of fixed-gear freestyling and it's growing tiresome. Of course, in other respects the fixed-gear culture has moved on. It turns out my dirty-person-wearing-a-hoodie costume was thoroughly out of date, as the new look appears to be flat-brim caps and puffy coats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8C2sxhdAI/AAAAAAAADiQ/QGmx2rv0vqs/s1600-h/streetwear.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264429628174464002" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8C2sxhdAI/AAAAAAAADiQ/QGmx2rv0vqs/s400/streetwear.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah yes, ideal riding apparel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I decided I was going to need help getting through the film, so I sought assistance in the form of alcohol. Fortunately, the bar was right behind me, and there was no line since everyone else was riveted by the film.

I then returned to my place and promptly drank it in about three gulps.

A new rider would be introduced, then he'd spin really fast down a really steep hill, then a song would kick in and he'd dodge some cars, pull some skids, do some wheelies, or jump over some things. When it comes to the technical aspects of moviemaking, I'm fairly ignorant, though I will say that to me the movie did look very professional. Actually, it was kind of like watching a commercial for California tourism in that it was pretty but otherwise fairly uneventful. As it drew to a close, I realized that for all the music and outfits and Golden Gate Bridge shots it would also be interesting to see a movie like this that gives the viewer a little insight into who these riders are. Then again, I suppose that's asking too much, since this sort of thing is essentially soft-core bike porn. Also, the place was packed, and everyone else seemed to really enjoy it, since they were pretty much watching themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8EQkJnkeI/AAAAAAAADi4/biw4L2bUroQ/s1600-h/mingling.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264431172047835618" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 300px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8EQkJnkeI/AAAAAAAADi4/biw4L2bUroQ/s400/mingling.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the movie, I swiftly moved through the crowd since I wanted to go home and watch "Little Britain," and I was among the first people to the vast bicycle parking lot that E. 1st St. had become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8EbpuQl6I/AAAAAAAADjA/C7T9dnboQeA/s1600-h/after+show.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264431362522257314" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8EbpuQl6I/AAAAAAAADjA/C7T9dnboQeA/s400/after+show.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ironic Orange Julius Bike was easy to find, since it was the only one with brakes and without expensive anodized hubs. (My hubs are cheap and badly oxidized and basically look like rotting apple cores.) Most of the other bikes only looked crappy at a glance but were in fact very expensive. Except for this one, with the requisite Obama spoke card:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8ElcuOtlI/AAAAAAAADjI/seXl2EAjrIk/s1600-h/obama+spoke+card.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264431530831165010" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8ElcuOtlI/AAAAAAAADjI/seXl2EAjrIk/s400/obama+spoke+card.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until last night, I was still undecided with regard to the Presidential election, but that spoke card may have clinched my vote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, if you like watching people ride fixed-gear bikes you'll most likely enjoy Macaframa. I'm probably not the target audience, but they seem to have done a good job. You'll also probably enjoy the upcoming "&lt;a href="http://empirebegins.com/"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;," which involves none other than Prolly and is already &lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2008/10/29/bike_1.php"&gt;getting lots of attention&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to all these movies fixed-gear cyclists are fast cementing their reputation as urban daredevils. Ultimately, I'm sure we'll see a feature-length, mainstream film. It will probably be just like "Quicksilver," except none of the characters will be messengers.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/feeds/8654745638929708977/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4213956784784062266&amp;postID=8654745638929708977' title='107 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/8654745638929708977'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4213956784784062266/posts/default/8654745638929708977'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/11/from-bsnyc-culture-desk-bsnyc-attends.html' title='From the BSNYC Culture Desk: BSNYC Attends a Movie Premiere'/><author><name>BikeSnobNYC</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11256142855437740163</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SQ8GxZXbglI/AAAAAAAADjo/NigZm-QOCLU/s72-c/la+1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>107</thr:total></entry></feed>
