Don’t take Motrin, take a meeting. When you learn to use a non-schwing carrier correctly, you won’t be in pain.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few days, there were &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Motrinmoms"&gt;Tweets&lt;/a&gt; aplenty.  Blogger Katja Presnal created a YouTube &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhR-y1N6R8Q&amp;eurl=http://www.skimbacolifestyle.com/"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; featuring anti-Motrin commentary.  The most active citizen journalists begin contacting mainstream media outlets about the story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 17, just two days after the first negative blog commentary, Kathy Widmer, VP of Marketing for McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, apologized and announced that the company was pulling the &lt;a href="http://jnjbtw.com/?p=362"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his recent article on “Motrin-Gate” in  &lt;a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=132787"&gt;Ad Age&lt;/a&gt;, Jack Neff thinks it’s all a tempest in a teapot.  He writes:  “J&amp;J might have been a tad hasty in pulling down its ad. In doing so, it bowed to a vocal flash mob that represents a tiny fraction of moms, and Twitter, which itself attracts about 0.15% of the world's internet users each day … about 1.1 million people in the U.S. And despite a storm of media attention, the ad — together with a YouTube video put together by a mommy blogger on the controversy — received less exposure than one 30-second spot on a cable news network.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take issue with Neff’s position.  It’s typical — and a bit arrogant — of the advertising industry to equate the impact of a relatively small percentage of the social media audience to advertising equivalencies (and hence importance), thereby minimizing the impact of irritating the mommy blogger community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I credit J&amp;J for its apology, because that’s what seemed to have helped manage the crisis; in fact, things quieted down after Widmer’s apology was communicated throughout the online community.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the Don Imus fracas in April last year?  Initially, no one noticed his tasteless comments about the Rutgers’ women’s basketball team … until the &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200704040011"&gt;Media Matters&lt;/a&gt; blog picked up on it and forwarded video to a group of mainstream media, who ran with the story.  It cost Imus his job (though he’s now back to being gainfully employed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our tips for crisis communications in the media generally involve addressing a faux pas sooner rather than later, as we would judge the potential impact of the negative response based on the risk to the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Motrin" rel="tag"&gt;Montrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Twitter" rel="tag"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Motrin+Mommy+ad" rel="tag"&gt;Motrin Mommy ad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social+media" rel="tag"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/MagicCitySlingers" rel="tag"&gt;MagicCitySlingers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Katja+Presnal" rel="tag"&gt;Katja Presnal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Kathy Widmer." rel="tag"&gt;Kathy Widmer&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Jack+Neff" rel="tag"&gt;Jack Neff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/crisis+communications" rel="tag"&gt;crisis communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/public+relations" rel="tag"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/153850359829181369/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=153850359829181369&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/153850359829181369'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/153850359829181369'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2008/12/twitter-moms-take-on-motrin.shtml' title='Twitter Moms Take on Motrin'/><author><name>Online Fluency</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04545873630637500039</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-7790260373043959620</id><published>2008-11-03T10:38:00.012-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-03T13:49:11.018-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dangerous Ideas about PR?</title><content type='html'>By Robbin Goodman, Makovsky + Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I attended The Council of Public Relations Firms'  &lt;a href="http://prfirms.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Calendar.eventDetail&amp;eventId=27&amp;node"&gt;Critical Issues Forum&lt;/a&gt; on “The Most Dangerous Ideas about the Future of Public Relations.”  I agreed with the substance, if not the tone, of marketing blogger BL Ochman's &lt;a href="http://www.whatsnextblog.com/archives/2008/10/pr_industry_leaders_put_their_feet_in_their_mouths_at_critical_issues_forum.asp"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on this conference, concerning  statements made by a couple of senior executives from large PR agencies.  “Some pretty dangerous ideas came out of the mouths of people who really should know better,” she said.  She and I were both surprised by a comment from a senior public relations pro that our job is about “stealing,” rather than “creating, new ideas about using new media today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was even more struck by obervations made by  &lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/david-f-d-alessandro"&gt;David D'Alessandro&lt;/a&gt;, former CEO of John Hancock Financial Services, who gave the keynote address.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D'Alessandro cited statistics from  &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/444/news-media"&gt;Pew Research&lt;/a&gt; that show that the percentage of people who reported "reading a newspaper yesterday" fell from 40 percent in 2006 to 34 percent in 2008 (for print only, those numbers fell from 32 to 27 percent, respectively for those years).   He pointed out that one of the biggest casualties of the shrinking media is the exit of veteran reporters who know their beats and issues in-depth.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For the record, Pew contends that the television news audience, by contrast, has generally remained stable since 2006, and the proportion regularly watching cable news in particular has increased, from 34% to 39% from 2006-08.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard reality is that the heyday of print media - so vividly illustrated last week by the end of the daily &lt;em&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1029/p25s01-usgn.html"&gt;print edition&lt;/a&gt; and major cutbacks at &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29mag.html?_r=3&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin"&gt;Time Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/business/media/27paper.html?ref=business"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star-Ledger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Newark) - is rapidly fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;News audiences are seeking their information online … a fact verified by a recent report by the &lt;a href="http://www.naa.org/PressCenter/SearchPressReleases/2008/Online-Newspaper-Viewership.aspx"&gt;Newspaper Association of America&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that in the fourth quarter of 2007, 39 percent of all active Web users visited newspaper Web sites, with visits averaging 44 minutes a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this should be news to PR practitioners, although many companies outside of the consumer and technology sectors remain skeptical about new media.  Despite the troubles of print media, people are more interested in news than ever before.  While 85 percent of the population read print newspapers back in 1986, today 83 percent are using search engines to find news rather than patronize a news brand (we couldn't find the citation and D’Alessandro didn't supply it in the talk).  Even when a traditional newspaper scoops a story today, within hours the social media have grabbed it and are running with it. Thus, the role of traditional media today in PR campaigns isn't going to completely disappear, it's going to shift - in becoming a feeder of "free content" to the new media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+Council+of+Public+Relations+Firms'+Critical+Issues+Forum" rel="tag"&gt;The Council of Public Relations Firms' Critical Issues Forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/BL+Ochman" rel="tag"&gt;BL Ochman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/David+D'Alessandro" rel="tag"&gt;David D'Alessandro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Pew+Research" rel="tag"&gt;Pew Research&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Newspaper+Association+of+America" rel="tag"&gt;Newspaper Association of America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Christian+Science+Monitor" rel="tag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Time+Inc." rel="tag"&gt;Time Inc.&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Star-Ledger" rel="tag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star-Ledger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/public+relations" rel="tag"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/7790260373043959620/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=7790260373043959620&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/7790260373043959620'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/7790260373043959620'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2008/11/dangerous-ideas-about-pr.shtml' title='Dangerous Ideas about PR?'/><author><name>Online Fluency</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04545873630637500039</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-5596500150495553887</id><published>2008-07-21T13:02:00.010-04:00</published><updated>2008-07-21T13:26:16.567-04:00</updated><title type='text'>Seniors’ Online Behavior Mirroring Teens</title><content type='html'>By Robbin Goodman, Makovsky + Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BBC recently reported the death of the world’s oldest blogger – Australian &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7505029.stm"&gt;Olive Riley&lt;/a&gt;, age 108. You can find photos and remembrances of Olive at &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutolive.com.au/"&gt;http://www.allaboutolive.com.au/&lt;/a&gt; as well as her &lt;a href="http://www.worldsoldestblogger.blogspot.com"&gt;blog entries&lt;/a&gt;. Most of her fan base was in the U.S. and reportedly she received a great deal  of attention because of U.S. blogger &lt;a href="http://www.komando.com/"&gt;Kim Komando&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who think blogging and social networks are only for the 20- and 30-somethings, a &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcenter.org/pdf/CDF-AARP_Press_Release_Final.pdf"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from Jeff Cole’s Center for the Digital Future at the USC Annenberg School for Communication, states that “Internet users 50+ are rapidly closing the digital divide with booming online activity,” and that the community involvement of this age group even exceeds that of teenagers, at least in some categories. The study found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users 50+ are online news junkies.&lt;/strong&gt; 42% of those 50+ check the Internet for news daily or several times a day, compared to 18% of users under 20.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They love their online communities.&lt;/strong&gt; Those 50+ report extensive involvement in their communities: 58% log in to their online community daily or several times a day, compared to 47% of those under 20 years of age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A significant number have increased their social activism.&lt;/strong&gt; Participation in online communities has increased social activism for 30% of members 50 and older, compared to 29% who are under the age of 20. (Presidential candidates take note!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They’re maintaining social relationships online.&lt;/strong&gt; Among users under 50 years of age, 46% said the internet is important or very important in maintaining their social relationships – identical to those over 70. Over 70!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;However, IMs and video downloads are still the territory of young users – only 9 percent of users 50+ said IM was important or very important, compared to 48% of those under 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, while seniors represent a lucrative market, two-thirds of consumers aged 50-69 researched their online purchase in stores first, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1006416"&gt;Center for the Digital Future&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/seniors" rel="tag"&gt;seniors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Olive+Riley" rel="tag"&gt;Olive Riley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/world's+oldest+blogger" rel="tag"&gt;world's oldest blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Kim+Komando" rel="tag"&gt;Kim Komando&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Jeff+Cole" rel="tag"&gt;Jeff Cole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Center+for+the+Digital+Future" rel="tag"&gt;Center for the Digital Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/USC+Annenberg+School" rel="tag"&gt;USC Annenberg School&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/internet+users" rel="tag"&gt;internet users&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/5596500150495553887/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=5596500150495553887&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/5596500150495553887'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/5596500150495553887'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2008/07/seniors-online-behavior-mirroring-teens.shtml' title='Seniors’ Online Behavior Mirroring Teens'/><author><name>Online Fluency</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04545873630637500039</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-5705618753718909255</id><published>2008-04-16T09:54:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2008-04-16T10:08:01.904-04:00</updated><title type='text'>All the News That’s Fit to Print … According to?</title><content type='html'>By Robbin Goodman, Makovsky + Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story didn’t make it to the mainstream media, but &lt;a href="http://www.whatsnextblog.com/archives/2008/04/what_constitutes_news_now_that_everyone_can_be_a_reporter.asp"&gt;B.L. Ochman’s blog&lt;/a&gt; asks the right question: What constitutes news now that everyone is a reporter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She cites how &lt;a href="http://www.tonykatz.com/?p=109"&gt;Tony Katz&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tonykatz"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;social networking site&lt;/a&gt; that lets its users stay connected with colleagues, friends and family in real-time — to provide an &lt;a href="http://1timstreet.blogspot.com/2008/04/twiiterer-sends-news-of-potential-bomb.html"&gt;eyewitness account&lt;/a&gt;, that unrolled a bit like the frames of a film, about how a man who claimed he had a detonator in his pocket was taken off a &lt;a href="http://www.usairways.com/awa/"&gt;US Airways&lt;/a&gt; flight… while he, a passenger on the plane, sat observing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read the details on BL’s and Tony’s blogs. The long and short of it is that the gentleman was quickly escorted off the plane without incident and the airline received glowing praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives new meaning to “If a tree falls in a forest….” Except for a handful of bloggers who reported it, at the time of this writing no mainstream media appeared to have picked up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fascinating account complements a recent study on the &lt;a href="http://www.stateofthenewsmedia.org/2008/chapter%20pdfs/PEJ2008-Overview.pdf?cat=9&amp;amp;media=1"&gt;State of the News Media&lt;/a&gt; by Pew Research, which has done landmark work on the role of the Internet and social media in people’s lives. The study suggests that the trend toward user-created content for news appears more limited, including on “citizen” blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pew study reported that the agenda of the traditional news media continues to narrow, not broaden, based on an audit of topics of coverage, according to the study. While it would appear that online news content could provide new opportunities to aggregate more sources, online platforms are limited by what the originating sources are providing. (In other words, citizens aren’t doing original reporting in the context of mainstream media [MSM] sites which focus on a narrow band of news. Although clearly some of them ARE reporting it elsewhere.) All the news that’s fit to print is clearly a function of who’s trying to report it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lest we be too critical of the MSM, Pew also reports that the (traditional) newsroom has seemed to adapt very well to the new media environment. The laggard in news operations now is the business side of the organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/B.L.+Ochman" rel="tag"&gt;B.L.

Or Survival of the Fittest?</title><content type='html'>By Robbin Goodman, Makovsky + Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=125141"&gt;“Media Work Force Sinks to 15-Year Low,”&lt;/a&gt; (subscription required) screamed the Ad Age headline.  Reporter Bradley Johnson went on to describe how one in four media jobs has disappeared since the peak of newspaper employment in 1990.  Loss of subscribers and ad dollars, and competition for readers’ attention with a wide range of media, including digital properties, have all contributed to the slump.  Over the past year alone, 16,900 newspaper staff have been cut (nearly five percent) … while, interestingly, employment in marketing consultancies is up nearly 11 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question the implicit assumption that there is an inverse relationship between the number of staff positions on newspapers and the growth of marketing services agencies. It’s more complicated than that.  Ad agencies aren’t growing.  They’re slimming down and consolidating.  I’m certain many of those who are leaving the world of conventional advertising are, in fact, starting their own marketing services agencies or joining other, smaller independent firms.  Another factor that wasn’t explored in the article is the degree to which corporations are choosing to use external experts, rather than staff up internally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that marketing consulting is growing because, increasingly, print ads aren’t working as well as they used to, and marketers are interested in trying new things. The fact that the “mix” of marketing services is increasing is because of that experimentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies conducted by &lt;a href="http://www.boozallen.com/home"&gt;Booz Allen Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, a client of our firm, in partnership with the &lt;a href="http://www.ana.net/"&gt;Association of National Advertisers&lt;/a&gt; have shown that world class marketers are increasingly dismayed by the ad agency community’s slowness to come to grips with this shift in spending.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/HD_Marketing_2010.pdf"&gt;“HD Marketing 2010:  Sharpening the Conversation,”&lt;/a&gt;, more than 90 percent of marketers surveyed say they plan to increase their digital spending. However, only 24 percent of the survey respondents think their organizations are digitally savvy. Almost 60 percent of participants believe creative, creative and media capabilities should be rebundled …but not by traditional full-service agencies.  In fact, media partnerships — with both media companies and media agencies — are becoming more important than traditional full-service agency partnerships to twice as many marketers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With respect to the decline in newspaper editorial jobs, actually, a good study that needs to be done is an examination of trends in the utilization of freelance journalists by newspapers.  While it’s clear newspapers are indeed eliminating headcount … it seems that newspapers such as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are using a higher percentage of freelance journalists in recent years than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the increased number of articles that are appearing online only (and the Wall Street Journal is a good example of this), there are many more opportunities for freelancers to byline articles.  The Saturday and Sunday New York Times business sections have a significant amount of freelance-written content.  Many of the Journal’s features, such as Career Journal, feature many freelance written stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line?  I don’t see this as the decimation of the fourth estate.  It’s just a matter of adaptation and the survival of the fittest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/media" rel="tag"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Ad+Age" rel="tag"&gt;Ad Age&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Bradley+Johnson" rel="tag"&gt;Bradley Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/marketing+consultancies" rel="tag"&gt;marketing consultancies&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ad+agencies" rel="tag"&gt;ad agencies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Booz+Allen+Hamilton" rel="tag"&gt;Booz Allen Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Association+of+National+Advertisers" rel="tag"&gt;Association of National Advertisers&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/newspapers" rel="tag"&gt;newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/freelancers" rel="tag"&gt;freelancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/4955230869755991004/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=4955230869755991004&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/4955230869755991004'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/4955230869755991004'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2008/02/apocalypse-now-or-survival-of-fittest.shtml' title='Apocalypse Now?

(In case you were wondering, the previous smallest known copy of the Bible measured 1.1 x 1.3 x 0.4 inches, weighing 0.4 ounces and containing 1,514 pages, according to &lt;a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/default.aspx"&gt;Guinness World Record&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we live in a world where we've all gotten rather blasé about breathtaking technology achievements. I still remember writing articles and press releases on manual typewriters, and the days before there was FedEx and email, never mind Blackberrys and instant messaging. It was in 1965 that Intel's  &lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/bios/moore.htm"&gt;Gordon E. Moore&lt;/a&gt; stated what came to be known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law"&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt; - the number of transistors that can be inexpensively placed on an integrated circuit is increasing exponentially, to paraphrase, doubling price-performance of semiconductors approximately every two years - and along with that, processing speed and power. Moore's Law, over 40 years old now, was said to continue to be alive and well at the end of 2007, although improved hardware performance is not always equated with innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first computers, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC"&gt;ENIAC&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1946, cost $500,000 and was designed and built to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army's &lt;a href="http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.htm"&gt;Ballistic Research Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.  It weighed 30 tons. We all have just as much or more computing power on our laptops and PDAs and &lt;a href="http://wii.com"&gt;Wiis&lt;/a&gt; for just a few hundred bucks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That said, in spite of the difficulties of achieving &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/dec2007/id20071219_302022.htm?chan=search"&gt;true innovation&lt;/a&gt; these days, optimism and advancing technology go hand in hand. May they continue to flourish in the New Year and with them, humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/technology" rel="tag"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Technion+Institute" rel="tag"&gt;Techion Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Guinness+World+Record" rel="tag"&gt;Guinness World Record&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Intel" rel="tag"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Moore's+Law" rel="tag"&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ENIAC" rel="tag"&gt;ENIAC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Ballistic+Research+Laboratory" rel="tag"&gt;Ballistic Research Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Wiis" rel="tag"&gt;Wiis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/innovation" rel="tag"&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/6878381676024384874/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=6878381676024384874&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/6878381676024384874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/6878381676024384874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2008/01/where-worlds-collide.shtml' title='Where Worlds Collide'/><author><name>Online Fluency</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04545873630637500039</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-2146157451228964589</id><published>2007-11-30T11:25:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-04T17:46:55.139-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Time For a Facelift?</title><content type='html'>By Tim Kane, Makovsky + Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to work for one of the legends of the advertising business, a woman known for her incredible talent, her great wisdom and her extraordinarily ageless beauty. Long past the time when a woman is expected to settle into a more matronly mien, Nina was still turning cranky captains of industry into tongue-tied schoolboys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, this was a subject of great discussion around the agency. How did she manage it? Had she been nipped and tucked? “Of course she’s had work done,” a competitor once sneered. “It’s just that … you can’t tell where.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got up the nerve to ask her, Nina didn’t hesitate. “I had a little lift,” she admitted. “When I was in my thirties.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your &lt;em&gt;thirties?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, you have to get the work done before anybody notices you need it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, she’s wise as well as beautiful. And I was reminded of that wisdom today, as Makovsky + Company officially celebrated the launch of the newly revamped &lt;a href="http://www.makovsky.com"&gt;www.makovsky.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Because the time to give your website a facelift is not when it starts to look a little long in the tooth, or when your customers and your constituents start having trouble with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, our original website was perfectly fine. Nobody was complaining about it. But the site did have a few wrinkles: It wasn’t as client-focused as it could’ve been. It wasn’t as easy to update and navigate as it should’ve been. It needed less copy in some places, and better copy in others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, long before anyone started clamoring for changes, we redesigned the site.  We made the navigation more intuitive, and the content richer and deeper. We added new content management software. We gave it a look and feel that was a more artful expression of our identity, and a more accurate reflection of our brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina’s already visited. “I love your new site,” she wrote. “And your picture looks exactly like Russell Crowe.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, she’s still beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think her eyesight is starting to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/website+redesign" rel="tag"&gt;website+redesign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facelift" rel="tag"&gt;facelift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/public+relations" rel="tag"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/2146157451228964589/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=2146157451228964589&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/2146157451228964589'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/2146157451228964589'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/11/time-for-facelift.shtml' title='Time For a Facelift?'/><author><name>Online Fluency</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04545873630637500039</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-5214700566156216353</id><published>2007-11-06T13:17:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-06T14:04:04.184-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Come. Stay. Speak. Three Ways to Make Your Site More Sociable</title><content type='html'>By Tim Kane, Makovsky + Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you've been eyeing this new social media trend, taking in all the buzz, and you're starting to wonder if it's time to get your company into the game. Maybe a new website, or an addition to your existing one. Maybe a blog, maybe a forum, maybe some kind of knowledge sharing vehicle ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short answer is, yes, absolutely. There are a lot of potential advantages, and really only one obstacle. It's not mastering the technology, which is getting simpler all the time. And it's not the cost, which comes down a bit more every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, your biggest issue is making sure your social site is, well ... sociable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded of this last Sunday, when I took my dog, Oscar, to the New Castle Bulldog Club's very first Bulldog Social. The idea was terrific, at least on paper: Some twenty families and their bullies would gather in a beautiful field in a beautiful park on a beautiful day, take off the leashes, and hilarity would ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's pretty much how it worked - for the first five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a brief interlude of mutual sphincter sniffing, the dogs took off. Some charged into the woods, some chased after other, non-bulldog dogs (one little Wheaton terrier in particular will never be the same), while Oscar -- always the loner -- set out to systematically mark every tree, bush, rock, twig and slow-moving squirrel in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried to call them back, but the dogs weren't buying it. As we stood in the now-empty field, wondering what to do next, one tearful little boy summed up the whole problem. "But don't they understand?" he sniffed. "We did this for them!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the kind of behavior you see with new social sites. People may come, they may sniff around -- but they don't contribute. Even though you've specifically designed the site around their interests and their issues, they still don't seem to be interested in participating in the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be very mystifying and frustrating - we did this for them! - but fortunately, there are some steps you can take, some features you can design into your site that will help keep potential members from wandering off into the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it helps to understand why people contribute to online communities. In his 1999 study, "The Economics of Online Cooperation: Gifts and Public Goods in Cyberspace," Peter Kollok outlined three fundamental motivations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Anticipated reciprocity: You contribute something when you expect to get something in return.&lt;br /&gt;2. Increased recognition: You contribute if it will increase your personal prestige, or build your reputation.&lt;br /&gt;3. Sense of efficacy: You contribute when you believe it will have an impact on the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To jumpstart the process of participation in your website, you need to incorporate features and functions that build off these basic drivers. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Measure contributions (increased recognition). Like eBay and its star system, sites that count and display the number of contributions tend to have a more active and committed membership. And when those contributions count towards increasing levels of recognition (yellow stars vs blue stars, "New Member" vs "Heavyweight Member") the effect is magnified.&lt;br /&gt;* Encourage responses (anticipated reciprocity). Adding a rate-and-respond feature to each posting not only gives contributors an immediate quid pro quo, it also gives newer, and more timid, members of the community a low risk opportunity to begin making their own contributions.&lt;br /&gt;* Trust the members (sense of efficacy). Sites aimed at a younger or a broader audience may need an active administrator pre-vetting the content. But for most business sites, where the audience is made up of professionals with a higher level of maturity, allowing a greater degree of freedom will spark a greater degree of participation. Key word filtering and peer moderation will still be important, but other than that, why not let them post whatever's on their mind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, most people will tell you that when designing a website, content is king. But in an online community, content is driven by contributions. So your first concern must be to construct a website that actively encourages and consistently rewards participation by its members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the next Bulldog Social, I'll be there -- with a pocket full of Pupperoni.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/5214700566156216353/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=5214700566156216353&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/5214700566156216353'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/5214700566156216353'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/11/come-stay-speak.shtml' title='Come.

While it may sound biased for me to be telling you that it was well received, it is safe to say that it was evident from the turnout, and the questions that were asked, that more corporate communications professionals are concerned with the issue of Internet crisis communications and asking questions about how to engage. When we began to take questions, it was like a force was unleashed, particularly around issues concerning "separating the wheat from the chaff" - whether all negative comments or "attacks" in the blogosphere deserve a response, and how to approach it - and the special situation faced by health care communicators, who need to be cognizant of regulatory issues around reporting adverse events. In the audience were PR executives from numerous large corporations, from Toyota to Lockheed and Simplot. Over the next couple of weeks I will share some of the information that was presented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social+Media" rel="tag"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/crisist+management" rel="tag"&gt;crisis management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/PRSA+International+Conference" rel="tag"&gt;PRSA International Conference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/corporate+communications" rel="tag"&gt;corporate communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/public+relations" rel="tag"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/8043317941256800917/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=8043317941256800917&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/8043317941256800917'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/8043317941256800917'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/10/social-media-crisis-management.shtml' title='Social Media + Crisis Management'/><author><name>Online Fluency</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04545873630637500039</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-6985915651900353911</id><published>2007-08-27T15:12:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-08-27T19:09:09.852-04:00</updated><title type='text'>Mind the [Generation] Gap!</title><content type='html'>If you have kids — or nieces and nephews in their tweens, teens and early 20s — you’re probably already well aware of the digital generation gap.  We email; they SMS.  We’re shocked to see how much information about us is available online; they happily bare their souls on their blogs and MySpace pages.  We socialize IRL (that’s “in real life,” for those of you over the age of 25); they network virtually … and enthusiastically.  We read news; they use social networks and instant messaging to disseminate news.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the difference between the generations may be narrowing … at least in some areas.  Social networking is no longer entirely confined to kids.  Last year, the &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15147500/"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reported that half of MySpace users are 35 or older. Only 30% are under the age of 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The online research firm &lt;a href="http://blog.compete.com/topics/social-web/page/6/"&gt;Compete&lt;/a&gt; reports that two out of every three people online visited a social networking site last June. And according to Jeff Cole, director of the USC-Annenberg &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcenter.org/pdf/2007-Digital-Future-Report-Press-Release-112906.pdf"&gt;2007 Digital Future Project&lt;/a&gt;, 43% of Internet users who are members of online communities say that they “feel as strongly” about their virtual community as they do about their real-world communities. Nearly three out of five (56.6%) log into their community at least once a day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are the implications of these shifts for those of us in communications?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find out, the &lt;a href="http://www.prsa.org/"&gt;Public Relations Society of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dj.com/"&gt;Dow Jones &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt; conducted &lt;a href="http://media.prsa.org/press_kits.cfm?presskit_id=7"&gt;“Wired for Change,”&lt;/a&gt; a survey of PR professionals and students that explores their attitudes, usage and expectations of technology in shaping current and future communication practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the more interesting findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Both groups believe that the technology-driven channels that provide the best opportunities for the practice of public relations are online news websites, blogs and social networking sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generally, students have a more positive view of new communications tools than professionals, especially professional networking web sites, internet TV, blogs, social networking sites, satellite TV, internet radio, chat rooms and video phones. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A majority of all PR professionals believe their organizations lag in broader communication technology use, with only 20% saying they are “ahead of the trend.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the majority of PR professionals and students think that print publications are more credible sources than various new media, younger internet users are just not reading print, preferring social networks and instant messaging for news.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;While communicators at all levels of experience, including students, strongly believe that technology has positively impacted the practice of PR, they also think that the new social media — including blogs and social networking sites — present critical credibility and ethical challenges. A majority of survey respondents acknowledge that, because they are “unregulated,” the new social media enable the potential for reputational harm and for rumors to spread quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;PRSA hopes to repeat the survey later this year to assess evolving trends in the new and next media and determine how opinions of public relations professionals and students have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digital+generation+gap" rel="tag"&gt;digital generation gap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/MySpace" rel="tag"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social+networking" rel="tag"&gt;social networking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social+media" rel="tag"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Jeff+Cole" rel="tag"&gt;Jeff Cole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/USC Annenberg" rel="tag"&gt;USC+Annenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/2007+Digital+Future+Project" rel="tag"&gt;2007 Digital Future Project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/PRSA" rel="tag"&gt;PRSA&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Dow+Jones+Company" rel="tag"&gt;Dow Jones &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/communications" rel="tag"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/public+relations" rel="tag"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/6985915651900353911/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=6985915651900353911&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/6985915651900353911'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/6985915651900353911'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/08/mind-generation-gap.shtml' title='Mind the [Generation] Gap!'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-1791001257158364756</id><published>2007-07-09T14:44:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-07-09T17:23:49.904-04:00</updated><title type='text'>Living on Glass Microscope Slides</title><content type='html'>If you missed &lt;a href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/"&gt;Tom Friedman’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; column last week, headlined &lt;a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/opinion/27friedman.html"&gt;The Whole World is Watching&lt;/a&gt;, you indeed missed a treat. Inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.lrn.com/about_lrn/leadership/executives"&gt;Dov Seidman’s&lt;/a&gt; new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Anything-Means-Everything-Business/dp/0471751227/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-3757254-6729728?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1183340030&amp;sr=8-1"&gt;“How,”&lt;/a&gt; which is now on my reading list, Friedman notes “We’re all public figures now,” and “ ‘how’ you live your life and ‘how’ you conduct your business matters more than ever, because so many people can now see into what you do and tell so many other people about it on their own without any editor.” He goes on to quote Seidman: “We do not live in glass houses (houses have walls); we live on glass microscope slides…visible and exposed to all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with apologies to &lt;a href="http://www.annielennox.co.uk/"&gt;Annie Lennox&lt;/a&gt;, many people are living on “broken” glass microscope slides. There has been so much written about how, for example, in the work world, many young people have stubbed their toes in their job searches by not being cognizant of their online reputations. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, for instance has written about how the reputation of small businesses is increasingly being affected by the growth of &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118227481154340741-search.html?KEYWORDS=online+reputation&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month"&gt;online consumer reviews&lt;/a&gt; and how &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118279116847747277-search.html?KEYWORDS=online+reputation&amp;amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month"&gt;prospective students are turning to bloggers’ rankings of law schools as an alternative to the dominant rankings published by &lt;em&gt;U.S. News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;itself earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28pubed.html?ex=1183608000&amp;en=dffe1f8873eebfa3&amp;amp;ei=5070"&gt;the managing editor came under fire &lt;/a&gt;because a number of freelancers had not disclosed potential conflicts concerning issues they then reported on … information that may have been readily available online if anyone looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that almost every problem ignited by the march of technology inspires a solution. As Andrew Lavallee reported in &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118169502070033315-3PzMHMIbLz_n4N_IOACv2SSbVlQ_20070712.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, reputation management services going by names like &lt;a href="http://www.reputationdefender.com/"&gt;ReputationDefender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.defendmyname.com/"&gt;DefendMyName&lt;/a&gt;, are charging fees to expunge or downplay offensive blog mentions, embarrassing photos or critical mentions of names on the Web. One of the firms interviewed for the article charges $30 for each item that the user wants to try to correct or remove. It starts by sending polite email requests on behalf of its clients to web-site owners, and then escalates by contacting a site’s ISP about the problem. There have been some successes, such as for an identity-theft victim who had personal information published on a blog, and a medical student that discussed his own clinical depression on a public newsgroup. But these service providers have also seen their best efforts backfire and generate even more negative online dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which gets us back to Tom Friedman’s point. The best way to minimize the risks associated with internet-enabled transparency is to assume that the whole world is watching and always — always! — strive to do the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Tom+Friedman" rel="tag"&gt;Tom Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Dov+Seidman" rel="tag"&gt;Dov Seidman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Annie+Lennox" rel="tag"&gt;Annie Lennox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/online+reputation" rel="tag"&gt;online reputation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Andrew+Lavallee" rel="tag"&gt;Andrew Lavallee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/reputation+management+services" rel="tag"&gt;reputation management services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ReputationDefender" rel="tag"&gt;ReputationDefender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/DefendMyName" rel="tag"&gt;DefendMyName&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/1791001257158364756/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=1791001257158364756&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/1791001257158364756'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/1791001257158364756'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/07/living-on-glass-microscope-slides.shtml' title='Living on Glass Microscope Slides'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-5464994610103341368</id><published>2007-06-12T18:01:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-06-14T20:02:33.265-04:00</updated><title type='text'>A Healthy Debate</title><content type='html'>The blogger &lt;a href="http://www.whatsnextblog.com/archives/2007/06/prominence_of_blogs_in_pet_food_recall_reporting_demonstrates_why_mainstrea.asp"&gt;BL Ochman &lt;/a&gt;last week applauded &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-06-04-pet-blog-centerpiece_N.htm"&gt;'s Elizabeth Weise’s report &lt;/a&gt;on how bloggers drove the momentum behind the recent pet food/melamine recall. The mainstream media (MSM) hadn’t seized the story, said Ochman, though 56% of U.S. households own pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.petconnection.com/"&gt;Pet Connection&lt;/a&gt; blog was one of the heroes; it live-blogged and ran transcripts of the FDA press conference on the recall – reports that didn’t get to MSM websites or print outlets. The five Pet Connection bloggers - Dr. Marty Becker, Gina Spadafori, Christie Keith and Susan and Dr. Rolan - clearly applied standards of good reporting and also created an online database where pet owners could log the symptoms of their pets, treatment and outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the MSM didn’t feel the urgency of the pet food story right away, but as someone who adopted a dog from rescue at the time the story finally erupted, I am thankful that the story came to light, so I could keep Oliver well-fed … with product deemed safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/robbingoodman/OliverPicture/photo#5075598845655182866"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/robbingoodman/RnAmQimo7hI/AAAAAAAAAAw/vv5hI3ytBbI/s400/Oliver.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How cute is Oliver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of health, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/business/bio-carr.html"&gt;David Carr&lt;/a&gt;, the media reporter for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, complained in a rather &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/11carr.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;blog-like print column&lt;/a&gt; today that he found “everything, except insight” among bloggers and digital news sources on the questions raised about &lt;a href="http://www.avandia.com/"&gt;Avandia&lt;/a&gt;, a drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes. A &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa072761"&gt;published study&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/heartcenter/pub/staff/biography.asp?staffid=1185&amp;name=&amp;amp;amp;keyword1=&amp;Keyword2=&amp;amp;specialty=&amp;cnt="&gt;Dr. Steven Nissen&lt;/a&gt;, a noted cardiologist who also &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/286/8/954?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=vioxx+topol&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;blew the whistle&lt;/a&gt; on Vioxx, found that an analysis of previous studies revealed Avandia actually increased heart attack risk by 43% and called its use “a virtual public health emergency.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carr, who noted he uses Avandia himself, said that the polarized online discourse on the matter was confusing to him. “When it comes to meta-analysis on breaking issues, the Web seems better suited to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Hilton"&gt;Paris Hilton&lt;/a&gt; than patient safety,” he wrote.

Only 8 of 1,502 respondents correctly answered all 23 questions that asked them to identify public figures such as the Vice President of the U.S. and the governor of their state, and whether Congress passed legislation to increase the minimum wage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The survey respondents deemed most informed were more likely to be viewers of what the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;(subscription required) called "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/business/media/16pew.html "&gt;fake news programs&lt;/a&gt;" -- "&lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;"  and "&lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;" -- followed by the Web sites of major newspapers. Next on the list: "&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/"&gt;News Hour with Jim Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;" and then "&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,265873,00.html "&gt;The O’Reilly Factor&lt;/a&gt;" which tied with &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;;  and then &lt;a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html "&gt;Rush Limbaugh’s &lt;/a&gt;radio program (none of which were termed "fake").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 4 in 10 of all surveyed regularly use at least one type of Internet news source, either news pages of major search engines such as Google or Yahoo, websites of television news organizations, or websites of major national newspapers. About one in ten read blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does anyone listen to radio? When Don Imus uttered his now infamous remarks April 4 on &lt;a href="http://www.wfan.com/"&gt;WFAN&lt;/a&gt; radio, relatively few people were actually listening, according to the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117641076468168180-search.html?KEYWORDS=imus+%22media+matters%22&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/a&gt; (subscription required). It was 6:14 a.m. EST. But a blogger for &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200704040011"&gt;Media Matters for America &lt;/a&gt;was watching the MSNBC simulcast of the show, and posted a video clip of the comment. Media Matters sent an email to several hundred reporters, and while the post received numerous comments, the next day top news outlets did not mention the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t until about 36 hours after the comment was made when it proverbially hit the fan – or was it the WFAN? -- as MSNBC executives fielded complaints from viewers and employees who had seen the remark on the Media Matters site. Then everyone began paying attention. The &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;'s blog, &lt;a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/runninscared/archives/2007/04/imus_silenced.php"&gt;Running Scared&lt;/a&gt;, sums it up: "None of Imus' eminent guests, who included many of the nation's most prominent journalists and politicians, apparently ever thought the show's racist hijinks were worthy of mention."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it's just not real until we see it on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Pew+Research" rel="tag"&gt;Pew Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+Daily+Show" rel="tag"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+Colbert+Report" rel="tag"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+Wall+Street+Journal" rel="tag"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/NPR" rel="tag"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+New+York+Times" rel="tag"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/WFAN" rel="tag"&gt;WFAN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/MSNBC" rel="tag"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Media+Matters" rel="tag"&gt;Media Matters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Imus" rel="tag"&gt;Imus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+Village+Voice" rel="tag"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/8783345529466043785/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=8783345529466043785&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/8783345529466043785'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/8783345529466043785'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/04/is-anyone-paying-attention.shtml' title='Is Anyone Paying Attention?'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-117354997802548320</id><published>2007-03-10T12:55:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-03-10T13:12:12.973-05:00</updated><title type='text'>New Meaning (or is it “No Meaning?”) to Too Much Information</title><content type='html'>Yet another &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?1004659&amp;src=article1_newsltr "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; concludes we have more information available than ever, but getting the right information at the right time is getting harder all the time. The &lt;a href="http://www.idc.com/  "&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt;  study, commissioned by &lt;a href="http://www.emc.com/"&gt;EMC&lt;/a&gt;, who probably never met an exabyte it didn’t like, said the amount of information created and replicated in 2007 (255 exabytes) will be greater, for the first time, than available storage capacity (246 exabytes). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To truly appreciate this, consider that an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte  "&gt;exabyte&lt;/a&gt; is equal to one billion billion, or one quintillion, bytes … or  1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. (Need a cup of coffee …?)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to EMC, hard drives aren’t about to melt down from this overabundance of data – &lt;em&gt;although we may &lt;/em&gt;– because some data get deleted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these exabytes though are taking a different kind of toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://careers3.accenture.com/Careers/Global/AboutAccenture/CareersNews/0701_info_obtained_useless "&gt;Accenture&lt;/a&gt; surveyed over 1,000 middle managers at U.S. and U.K. large companies on receiving information necessary to their jobs:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle managers spend more than a quarter of their time searching for information they need for their jobs – and when they do find it, it is often wrong.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A majority (59%) acknowledged missing information that might be valuable almost every day because it exists elsewhere in the company and just cannot be found.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another sizeable chunk (36%) said there is so much information available that it takes a long time to actually find the right piece of data. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, middle managers are looking for a needle in an exabyte. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/eMarketer" rel="tag"&gt;eMarketer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/EMC" rel="tag"&gt;EMC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/IDC" rel="tag"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/information+overload" rel="tag"&gt;information overload &lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/117354997802548320/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=117354997802548320&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/117354997802548320'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/117354997802548320'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/03/new-meaning-or-is-it-no-meaning-to-too.shtml' title='New Meaning (or is it “No Meaning?”) to Too Much Information'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-117154896466211041</id><published>2007-02-15T09:06:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-02-17T17:37:11.370-05:00</updated><title type='text'>"Getting It" – 12-Year-Old Outshines the Pros on Driving Blog Traffic</title><content type='html'>You are missing a treat if you don’t visit &lt;a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/02/13/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-blog-the-advice-of-a-12-year-old/"&gt;Problogger&lt;/a&gt;,  where 12-year-old &lt;a href="http://www.techzi.net/"&gt;David Wilkinson    &lt;/a&gt;wrote  an articulate guest column on driving traffic to your blog.  I agreed with one of the 80+ people who commented on the post, Gary Ruplinger, who said: "This makes me feel really old when I’m getting advice from someone who’s half my age … Written a heck of a lot better than most adults who claim to have passed college English courses (and better than some writers I’ve hired who’ve claimed to have a masters degree in English)."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson reviews the basics ("start by building quality content for somebody to see"), then emphasizes the "three Cs: community, communication and consideration [to your audience]" as well as the importance of search optimization.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a "well, duh" that the teenage, pre-teen and 20-something generations are far more immersed in social media and that public relations directors need to pay attention to them … and structure campaigns to respond to the different media consumption habits of multiple audiences. The lesson: listen or be an obsolete counselor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To that point, the ad agency community has been under fire for not "getting" the age of digital communications fast enough. To its credit, &lt;a href="http://www.ogilvy.com/press/showpress.php?ID=3861"&gt;Ogilvy &amp; Mather&lt;/a&gt;   is really trying, having aligned with the blog search engine &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt; to try to help clients find their way. The initiative, as reported by &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117140352264107656.html?mod=mm_main_promo_left"&gt;Brian Steinberg &lt;/a&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; (subscription required), is aimed at reaching those who spend time creating content rather than watching or reading content produced by someone else. I doubt that this is going to solve the inherent conflict between advertising and blogging, but perhaps some people's horizons will be expanded. Maybe they should listen to the 12-year-old instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steinberg interviewed &lt;a href="http://atomicbomb.typepad.com/"&gt;Peter Hirshberg&lt;/a&gt; of Technorati who aptly calls on marketing organizations of all types to "have somebody on board whose job is to listen, to converse with and ensure the company is engaging with its customers, whether they are on blogs, &lt;a href="http://myspace.com/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, whatever….  The new 24-year-old person you will hire, you will be amazed by the knowledge they bring to the table." He observes "the most interesting action in the blogosphere is really the hundreds of topic areas where communities coalesce and people are having conversations," and "the blog isn’t going away, because it really does give the audiences a voice."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags:  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Problogger" rel="tag"&gt;Problogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Ogilvy" rel="tag"&gt;Ogilvy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Technorati" rel="tag"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/The+Wall+Street+Journal" rel="tag"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/MySpace" rel="tag"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/YouTube" rel="tag"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/117154896466211041/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=117154896466211041&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/117154896466211041'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/117154896466211041'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/02/getting-it-12-year-old-outshines-pros.shtml' title='&quot;Getting It&quot; – 12-Year-Old Outshines the Pros on Driving Blog Traffic'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-117070693739517103</id><published>2007-02-05T15:14:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-02-05T15:39:22.276-05:00</updated><title type='text'>How Do You Multitask? Let Me Count the Ways</title><content type='html'>Not that long ago I wrote about how media and technology had turned the 24-hour day into the &lt;a href="http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2006/11/43-hour-day.shtml"&gt;43-hour day&lt;/a&gt;.  Jumping on the bandwagon, &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?1004515&amp;src=article1_newsltr"&gt; eMarketer&lt;/a&gt; just declared in a new report that our virtual day is actually like 36 hours when all media consumption is considered.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new wrinkle of the eMarketer report is its specificity about the nature of our multitasking ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, two-thirds of the total U.S. adult population -- 100 million -- watched TV while they were online last year.  Ninety million listened to the radio while online.  More than 50 million read magazines while online (hmm… that doesn’t make sense unless you go online to read the magazine… unless we’ve sprouted an extra eye somewhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, people are not dropping one form of media in favor of another, according to senior analyst &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/AboutUs.aspx?page=Bios"&gt;Debra Aho Williamson &lt;/a&gt;, the author of the report.  "Full engagement is no longer a realistic expectation," she said.  (&lt;em&gt;What did she say…?)  &lt;/em&gt;And everybody is multitasking -- although kids are multitasking more. The dichotomy between generations on media consumption is growing, said Jeff Cole, of the &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcenter.org/"&gt;Center for the Digital Future, &lt;/a&gt;which has perhaps the longest longitudinal study on the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what’s a marketer to do? It bears stating the obvious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand how your audience is consuming information.  Take the time to get the facts, with online research and by seeking out information through live conversations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has always been true that the more channels you utilize to get in front of your target audiences, the more successful you will be.  It’s even truer today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are seeking to reach across the generations, it is critical to tailor your campaigns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measure.  The online component has made it increasingly easier to understand what’s working … and what’s not, so you can fine-tune your campaigns on the fly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags:  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/eMarketer" rel="tag"&gt;eMarketer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/multitasking" rel="tag"&gt;multitasking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Center+for+the+Digital+Future" rel="tag"&gt;Center for the Digital Future&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/117070693739517103/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=117070693739517103&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/117070693739517103'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/117070693739517103'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/02/how-do-you-multitask-let-me-count-ways.shtml' title='How Do You Multitask?

In the October 5th, 2006 issue of &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/em&gt;(not available online), Steve Knopper recounted in "Dylan’s Chart-Topping Strategy" how social media like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.itunes.com"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; were factors in spreading the word on Dylan’s new album, &lt;a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/moderntimes/news/main.html"&gt;Modern Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build-up began with a pre-release iTunes commercial along with an offer to buy Dylan’s entire catalogue for $199, including 42 rare tracks. His team then produced a home-movie style video for one cut, "When the Deal Goes Down," featuring Scarlet Johansson and premiering on AOL, where the video was watched 100,000 times on the first day and then &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNv02iE_9rU"&gt;posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, getting 15,000 more views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan also started a &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/9649029"&gt;MySpace page&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/em&gt;said that "Mr. Tambourine Man" had been played more than 700,000 times -- reaching scores of new young fans. &lt;a href="http://www.xmradio.com/bobdylan/"&gt;His new XM satellite radio show &lt;/a&gt;– also a new medium -- is drawing 1.7 million listeners a week.  And Dylan’s old recordings are moving.  Oh, and Starbucks also sold 227,000 copies of Dylan rarity CDs as exclusives, as well as 13,500 copies of the new album.  (The Starbucks deal also coincided with the premiere of Martin Scorsese’s documentary film about Dylan's life:  "No Direction Home: Bob Dylan.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sum result is that not only did Modern Times sell 193,000 copies in the first week, 20,000 of them digital, Dylan’s older recordings also received a boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty cool.  But most important, pretty smart marketing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags:  &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Rolling+Stone" rel="tag"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/corporate+blogging" rel="tag"&gt;corporate blogging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/youtube" rel="tag"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/iTunes" rel="tag"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social+networking" rel="tag"&gt;social networking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/myspace" rel="tag"&gt;My Space&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/XM+Radio" rel="tag"&gt;XM Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Starbucks" rel="tag"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/116897472523234449/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=116897472523234449&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116897472523234449'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116897472523234449'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2007/01/social-media-gives-new-meaning-to.shtml' title='Social Media Gives New Meaning to Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-116654893798060850</id><published>2006-12-19T12:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T16:16:04.173-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Tipping Point for Online Journalism?</title><content type='html'>The task of determining precisely who is a journalist is getting murkier. Mainstream media (MSM) are looking more like social media in their online editions. Teens are using texting to make or break movies on their opening weekends. Corporations are becoming publishers by encouraging employees to blog.  Public relations firms are pitching influential bloggers for exclusive stories. And the jobs of marketing and communications strategists get tougher as we sort through our influentials and how best to reach them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s my theory though that, with a few exceptions (predominantly in the technology and consumer marketing sectors), most public relations professionals are still conducting media relations much the way they always did.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sign of the times, in a recent RFP, a sales prospect from a London-based technology firm whose targets are chief marketing officers asked, "Has the shift online in U.S. media meant that most of your work is online?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We responded that there is no question that the importance of online media in the U.S. is accelerating, a trend more pronounced in the consumer category than the business category, although the latter is changing fast.  The &lt;a href="http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2006/12/whither-goest-yesterdays-news_04.shtml"&gt;recent announcement &lt;/a&gt;by the Wall Street Journal surrounding the roles of its print and online editions will give more impetus to that shift in the business press.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, a majority of business-to-business clients, particularly in industries such as financial services, professional services, health and investor relations, still say that their companies’ senior management value MSM over online media and prefer to be seen there.  It’s time to reconsider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s our job as communicators to be strong and knowledgeable in both print and online modalities and to help our clients and peers to understand the coming trends.  In a recently released report, &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcenter.org/"&gt;Surveying the Digital Future – The World Internet Project&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Southern California Annenberg School found that today’s 25- to 54-year-olds are far more likely to read offline newspapers and magazines, while those aged 12-24 prefer to read publications online.  The 12-24s who get their news online often find consumer-generated media and MSM-generated sources just as trustworthy (although they apparently become more discriminating as they get older). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you doubt the blending of social networking and journalism, check out &lt;a href="http://www.digg.com/"&gt;digg.com &lt;/a&gt;, a user-driven social content site in which readers play editor and decide the value of a news story.  The stories that get the most "Diggs" make the front page; alternatively users can "bury" stories that they don’t like, as well as post comments.  The stories can come from anywhere and users don’t always differentiate whether the story is journalistically sourced or from elsewhere. As &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/Digg+continues+to+battle+phony+stories/2100-1025_3-6144652.html?tag=nefd.lede"&gt;CNET reported &lt;/a&gt;, from time to time users plant phony stories and the site tries to crack down on such instances when discovered – just as &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm?POE=click-refer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has experienced &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10796_3-6033082.html"&gt;more than once&lt;/a&gt;.

This past summer, as reported by &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/08/21/8383639/index.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, the program — which adapts a wiki approach to the patent-approval process — has been endorsed by a growing list of companies (e.g., Microsoft, Red Hat). Using a collaborative platform, select outside experts share their observations and comments during the patent-review process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patent applications have tripled in the last two decades, but examiners have only 20 hours on average to review and research applications, a reason why so many questionable patents are being granted for ideas that aren’t new. In her &lt;a href="http://cairns.typepad.com/peertopatent/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nyls.edu/pages/591.asp"&gt;Professor Beth Noveck &lt;/a&gt;, Director of the Institute for Information Law &amp; Policy at New York Law School, proposed the wiki approach to peer review of patent applications, and the idea is taking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not surprising that IBM helped move the idea forward, as for 13 consecutive years it has received &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/"&gt;more patents than any other company in the world&lt;/a&gt;. In September, in fact, IBM formalized a &lt;a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/20325.wss "&gt;corporate policy &lt;/a&gt;stating patent applications should be available for public examination and issued a report, &lt;a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/www_innovate.nsf/pages/world.gio.ip.html"&gt;Building a New IP Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This effort though doesn’t just stand to benefit IBM. A start-up, Out-of-the-Box Computing, became the smallest company to allow some of its published patent applications to be peer reviewed this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great news and a step forward in demonstrating the credibility and value of community to corporations. The &lt;a href="http://www.makovsky.com/mak/corporatebloggingsurvey/Makovsky2006StateOfCorporateBloggingSurvey.pdf"&gt;2006 Makovsky State of Corporate Blogging study&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by Harris Interactive, reported that only 5% of Fortune 1000 senior executives believe "to a great extent" that corporate blogging is growing in credibility as a communications medium for corporations; 27% believed it was growing in credibility to a "moderate" extent, and 62% said "somewhat or not or not all." While the study, sponsored by my employer, didn’t specifically ask about online communities, it wouldn’t have been surprising to have received a similar response on the credibility of corporate social networks. We’ll ask next year and I invite your suggestions for questions to pose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/patent+approval" rel="tag"&gt;patent approval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/IBM" rel="tag"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/patent+review" rel="tag"&gt;patent review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Fortune+Magazine" rel="tag"&gt;Fortune Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Beth+Noveck" rel="tag"&gt;Beth Noveck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/patent+wiki" rel="tag"&gt;patent wiki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wiki" rel="tag"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/116585706337852332/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=116585706337852332&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116585706337852332'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116585706337852332'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2006/12/patently-good-idea.shtml' title='A Patently Good Idea'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-116525858102156784</id><published>2006-12-04T13:47:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T16:15:00.203-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Whither Goest “Yesterday’s News?”</title><content type='html'>You may have heard earlier this year about the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s &lt;/em&gt;plans to shrink the size of the print edition in Jan. of 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;(subscription required) revealed its plans in a &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116518991569939506.html?mod=hps_us_inside_ "&gt;Letter from the Publisher L. Gordon Crovitz&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt; (subscription required) &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/business/media/04journal.html?ref=business "&gt;also gave its interpretation&lt;/a&gt;.  The impact of the change transcends mere size reduction and extends to the nature of what will be reported in the print edition versus what will go online. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this development — combined with the &lt;em&gt;New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;announced intent to shrink its size from 13.5 inches to 12 inches in August 2007 — will be major ammunition for corporate communications directors to finally persuade senior management that online media are important and they should participate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beyond that, these changes are undoubtedly going to further change the competitive dynamic within traditional and social media. With a smaller news hole, and "yesterday’s news" relegated to snippets, the spotlight will shine more on bloggers and social networks.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the highlights of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s changes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. In paring the size of the paper by 3 inches, it will reduce the news content of the print edition by 10 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In the print edition, there will be a greater emphasis on analysis and insights, and what is expected to happen later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. "Yesterday’s news" will be shrunk into multiple news briefs columns in the inside pages, for each industry sector, called "In Brief," and will constitute approximately 20 percent of the content of the daily paper. The paper also plans to use more "infographics" to make it easier to access more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The print edition is working towards making 80 percent of its print content based on exclusives. Obviously, this is going to have a major impact on how companies release major news developments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. "Breaking news" will be covered on wsj.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Stories that start on page 1 and continue will be jumped to the two pages before the editorial page, to make them easier to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The paper will double the number of leisure and arts stories in "Personal Journal."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s an old Wall Street proverb — "Buy on the rumor, sell on the news" — that makes a clear distinction between that information which passes almost instantly from person to person and that which is officially sanctioned by the media.  The distinction is fading fast.  With the WSJ printing what Crovitz describes as "what the news means, not just what happened the day before" and "more forward-leaning coverage, with headlines featuring predictive and explanatory words like 'will' and 'means' and 'why'," it is clear that the key characteristics of the social media (i.e., urgency, timeliness, passion and a clear and distinctive point-of-view) are increasingly being embraced by the mainstream media as they work to ensure their relevance in today’s wired world.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Wall+Street+Journal" rel="tag"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Gordon+Crovitz" rel="tag"&gt;Gordon Crovitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social+media" rel="tag"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/New+York+Times" rel="tag"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/116525858102156784/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=116525858102156784&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116525858102156784'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116525858102156784'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2006/12/whither-goest-yesterdays-news_04.shtml' title='Whither Goest “Yesterday’s News?”'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-116483985204019786</id><published>2006-11-30T11:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T16:14:25.610-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The 43-Hour Day</title><content type='html'>When I was visiting family this past weekend in Minneapolis, I caught a great story in the &lt;em&gt;Star-Tribune &lt;/em&gt;by Neal Justin, &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/459/story/833974.html"&gt;"Swarmed by Screens."&lt;/a&gt; He reported on a local family whose home is stocked with 12 TV sets (for three people), a home theater unit, 6 computers, nearly 50 remote controls and a number of other electronic gadgets – and their struggles to maintain quality family time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin went on to cite an &lt;a href="http://www.omd.com/"&gt;OMD&lt;/a&gt; statistic that the average U.S. home now boasts an average of 12 technology/media devices, from big-screen TVs to video iPods, compared with 5 such devices 10 years ago. He posed the question: "Do so many screens make us smarter, savvier human beings or drooling zombies?" I probably ping-pong between those extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By OMD standards, my household ranks below average with technology/media distractions: five TVs, two computers, and two Treos. But if you included my &lt;a href="http://www.xmradio.com/"&gt;XM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sirius.com/"&gt;Sirius&lt;/a&gt; subscriptions and three daily newspaper subscriptions, I'd be up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to OMD, because of our penchant for doing two or more things at once, Americans now live in the age of what some call the "43-hour day" – the total time spent on various activities. More than 16 hours on average are spent on media and technology alone. In fact, more than 70 percent of consumers use multiple forms of media at the same time, according to a 2004 study by the &lt;a href="http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/pages/apinews/api_news_releases/seventy_percent_of_media_consu/"&gt;Media Center at the American Press Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, &lt;a href="http://www.careerjournal.com/columnists/cubicleculture/20060913-cubicle.html"&gt;Jared Sandberg&lt;/a&gt; (subscription required) of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;contended that while multitaskers seem to be accomplishing a lot, they're not doing anything very well. He wrote that multitasking is more "rooted in blind faith than fact" and that "what now passes for multitasking was once called not paying attention."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can relate, based on the number of times I answer "What?" to my husband, who is trying to converse with me while I'm busy answering work email in front of the TV watching the &lt;a href="http://www.newyorkmets.com"&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt; game with no sound, while the radio is turned up to &lt;a href="http://www.lionelonline.com"&gt;one of my favorite radio talk-show hosts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the cell phone is ringing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/multitasking" rel="tag"&gt;multitasking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/OMD" rel="tag"&gt;OMD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Jared+Sandberg" rel="tag"&gt;Jared Sandberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Wall+Street+Journal" rel="tag"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/New+York+Mets" rel="tag"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/American+Press+Institute" rel="tag"&gt;American Press Institute &lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/116483985204019786/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36715098&amp;postID=116483985204019786&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116483985204019786'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36715098/posts/default/116483985204019786'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://onlinefluency.makovsky.com/2006/11/43-hour-day.shtml' title='The 43-Hour Day'/><author><name>Robbin Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13604049117439715599</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36715098.post-116224255973914631</id><published>2006-11-29T17:02:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-01T14:56:33.470-05:00</updated><title type='text'>My profile</title><content type='html'>Robbin Goodman is Executive Vice President and a partner at New York-based &lt;a href="http://www.makovsky.com/"&gt;Makovsky + Company&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top 30 independent global public relations and investor relations firms in the U.S., and leads Online Fluency, the firm’s practice focusing on applying social networking to business issues.
