		<description><![CDATA[<p><!--nevermore--><br />
It has been a foregone conclusion for quite some time, by most people watching the events unfold surrounding the disappearance of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony, that she is most likely deceased. Furthermore, most believe that Caylee met her fate at the hands of her mother, Casey Anthony, now jailed and charged with a variety of crimes including murder in the first degree.</p>
<p>I have been of the opinion that Caylee most likely did meet her death at the hands of a family member. I am just not sure that Casey acted alone. Don&#8217;t ask me why I feel the way I do because I don&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a child&#8217;s skeletal remains were found by a utility worker in a wooded area about 1/4 of a mile from the Anthony home. During tonight&#8217;s news broadcast the reporter covering the story put more emphasis on just how close to the Anthony home those remains were located. According to the reporter the location is just twenty houses from the Anthony home; close enough to walk to the spot in just 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Investigators privately believe the remains recovered do belong to Caylee because of the size of the skull, the condition of the remains (decomposition appears to be approximately six months) and of course the close proximity to the Anthony home.</p>
<p>Investigators sought a search warrant for the Anthony home today and notified the Anthony family of the find.<br />

<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Allen Moore, a spokesman for the Orange County jail, said Casey Anthony was told about the discovery. She was placed under psychological observation, not suicide watch, and remains under protective custody. Her attorney, Jose Baez, was at the jail for about 90 minutes Thursday.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>George and Cindy Anthony appeared on Larry King Live Wednesday evening. They still cling to the belief their granddaughter is still alive and believe in the reported sightings of their granddaughter. They had plans to travel to Newport Beach, California to check out one of the sightings while in California for the Larry King show. When they received notification from law enforcement of Thursday&#8217;s discovery of skeletal remains they returned to Florida.</p>
<p>Casey Anthony&#8217;s trial was set to begin January 5, 2009; however, the judge granted Jose Baez&#8217;s motion to move the trial to March. Earlier this week the prosecution indicated they would not be seeking the death penalty against Anthony.</p>
<p>I would imagine if the remains found on Thursday turn out to be those of Caylee Marie Anthony, the state will change it&#8217;s mind about the death penalty. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the 90 minute attorney/client visit had some discussion about trying to reach a plea agreement.</p>
<p>No matter how this turns out, no matter who&#8217;s remains were left in a plastic bag, in the water, in the woods, it was a cruel thing to do to a child. If it is not Caylee, then somewhere there is another person who is guilty of murdering another innocent child.</p>
