			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>this Startup2Startup guest post is by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/seanellis">Sean Ellis</a>, author of the <a href="http://startup-marketing.com/">Startup-Marketing Blog</a>.<br />
</em></p>
<div id="attachment_153" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 317px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nandorfejer/3047887849/in/set-72157609625243151/"><img class="size-full wp-image-153" title="Paul Graham, Y Combinator @ Nov 2008 Startup2Startup" src="http://startup2startup.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/paul.jpg" alt="Paul Graham, Y Combinator @ Nov 2008 Startup2Startup" width="307" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jessica Livingston &amp; Paul Graham, Y Combinator with Dave McClure @ Nov 2008 Startup2Startup</p></div>
<p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> has occasionally been criticized as lacking commercial focus.  Their mantra &#8220;make something people want&#8221; says nothing about a business model.  But Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston clearly demonstrated at the <strong><a href="http://startup2startup.com/2008/11/13/nov20-paulgraham/">November Startup2Startup dinner</a></strong> (<em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nandorfejer/sets/72157609625243151/">photos</a> by Nandor Fejer</em>) that they&#8217;ve always been about building solid businesses.  The only difference now is that they&#8217;re stressing monetization a bit earlier.  In fact, four companies in their recent &#8220;cycle&#8221; have already reached positive cash flow – admittedly on bare bone costs (Paul defined this as <span class="highlight"><em>&#8220;ramen profitability&#8221;</em></span>).</p>
<p>The first step to building a solid business is getting the product right.  As Graham explains &#8220;get product right and there is a lot of room to make mistakes.&#8221;  In my experience with <a href="http://xobni.com">Xobni</a> and <a href="http://getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a> (both Y Combinator startups) this focus has greatly facilitated our marketing job.   Both were instilled early with a culture of trying to understand users.  It is not unusual for Y Combinator startups to show their website to Starbucks customers and ask &#8220;would you use this?&#8221; Graham encourages startups to apply this intelligence by making every word on the front page of their website count, either explaining what the application is or causing people to do what you want them to do.  Even if they don&#8217;t necessarily call it marketing, Y Combinator is clearly very savvy about customer development.</p>
<p>Beyond laying a strong marketing foundation, Graham also described how Y Combinator companies all help and protect each other.  Dave McClure, who moderated the discussion, joked that Y Combinator sounded a bit like a &#8220;startup union.&#8221;  Graham concurred warning that <span class="highlight">you don&#8217;t want to piss off a Y Combinator company</span>, and noted the growing Y Combinator alumni network numbers over 250 people and more than 100 startups.</p>
<div id="attachment_156" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 206px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nandorfejer/3048715778/in/set-72157609625243151/"><img class="size-full wp-image-156" title="Jessica Livingston, Y Combinator / Founders at Work" src="http://startup2startup.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/jessica.jpg" alt="Jessica Livingston, Y Combinator / Founders at Work" width="196" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jessica Livingston, Y Combinator / Founders at Work</p></div>
<p>So how do aspiring entrepreneurs gain acceptance into the exclusive Y Combinator community?  It starts with <a title="Y Combinator application" href="http://http://news.ycombinator.com/apply" target="_blank">an application</a> and then the most promising groups are invited for interviews.  Surprisingly the final decision is made after only a 10 minute interview.  Y Combinator prefers teams with either 2 or 3 founders, noting those startups appear to perform better on average than those with only a single founder, or 4 or more.  Partner <span class="highlight">Jessica Livingston describes the ideal founders as relentless, determined</span> – even a bit crazy, or at least less subject to peer pressure.  You have to be willing to keep trying new things and refuse to die.  Paul Graham adds that you need to be clear in your own head about what you are doing and be able to explain it to people.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short video clip of Leonard Speiser interviewing Paul on Y Combinator product philosophy, and  Jessica about her book <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders at Work</a>:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="349" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/AIwSLDRJaYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01&amp;border=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/AIwSLDRJaYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>And the reward for entry into Y Combinator?  Beyond the cash ($5,000 plus $5,000 per founder), Y Combinator startups receive critical guidance and VC introductions often needed for &#8220;success&#8221; – which Graham defines as the &#8220;founders getting rich&#8221; or a &#8220;significant exit&#8221;.  While his preference is for building great companies that keep rolling the dice, he admits that it sometimes makes sense for first-time entrepreneurs to opt for an earlier exit.</p>
<p>Following the inspiring interview of the YCombinator partners, the Startup2Startup participants broke into round table discussions.  Topics progressed from funding strategies to non-founder salaries.  While the focus is on helping rookie entrepreneurs, even the startup vets gain valuable new insights and relationships from Startup2Startup dinners.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.startupboy.com/startupboy/" target="_self">Naval Ravikant</a> of <a href="http://venturehacks.com/" target="_self">Venture Hacks</a> &amp; <a href="http://hitforge.com/" target="_self">The Hit Forge</a> was the featured speaker at the <a href="http://startup2startup.com/2008/08/18/august28-navalravikant-venturehacks/" target="_self">August 28 </a><a href="http://startup2startup.com/" target="_self">Startup2Startup</a>.  Naval gave valuable advice to the audience of over 100 entrepreneurs on raising capital and negotiating term sheets.  The feedback on Naval&#8217;s presentation was wildly positive, as Naval helped both first time and serial entrepreneurs peek into the black box that is venture capital.</p>
<p>(fyi: Naval&#8217;s slide presentation is below, and a video interview with Naval is included at the bottom)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="348.3606557377"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=navalventurehackss2saug2008-1220115496863820-9"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=navalventurehackss2saug2008-1220115496863820-9" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="348.3606557377"></embed></object></p>
<p>The 10 key things that you should know when raising venture capital, according to Naval:</p>
<p><span id="more-18"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>1.  Try to maintain control of the board for as long as possible</em></strong>.  Naval had a few key recommendations, including the design goal of having board seats reflect ownership.  Common board seats will unlikely increase, whereas new investors will often require a board seat/s as part of a financing.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.  Valuation is driven by the market; don&#8217;t take every penny off the table</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Entrepreneurs often focus exclusively on valuation and don&#8217;t pay attention to other key termsheet items.  Naval suggested that entreprenuers get a few termsheets before aggresively negotiating valuation with anyone.  And don&#8217;t take every penny off the table.  On valuation, find a fair deal for both sides &#8212; &#8220;money has karma, too.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>3.  Pay attention to the real impact of the option pool on founder equity.</em></strong><strong> </strong> Many entrepreneurs figure that raising $x on a $y valuation leaves them with equity of y/(x+y) .  So, for example, a  founder may assume that a $4MM raise on a $6MM pre-money valuation leaves founders with 60% ownership.  But if the employee option pool is 25% of the post-money (as it is typically expressed), but taken out of the pre-money (again, standard), that actually leaves 35% for founders (60%-25%).  This is not a &#8220;trick&#8221; by investors and is standard practice &#8212; but few first-time entrepreneurs understand the importance of taking the equity pool into consideration when understanding the real dilution a financing will have on them.</p>
<p><strong><em>4.  Vesting, even for founders, is a good idea.</em></strong><em> </em> Naval argued that many early stage companies have early founder issues.  It&#8217;s not a bad idea for FOUNDERS to support a standard vesting agreement for other founders.  What if a founder doesn&#8217;t work out and walks away with more equity than the entire employee option pool?</p>
<p><strong><em>5.  Ask for &#8220;standard&#8221; liquidation and anti-dilution provisions.</em></strong><strong> </strong> Allowing investors to get their money out first is very reasonable and standard in a financing.  Just make sure that the terms aren&#8217;t dramatically different as things can get very complex and extremely founder unfavorable once you veer from the norm.  Good investors shouldn&#8217;t ask for more, at least not in a Series A.</p>
<p><strong><em>6.  Read the small print on protective provisions.</em></strong> The idea here is to protect minority shareholders.</p>
<p><strong><em>7.  Expiration and non-disclosure</em></strong>.  It&#8217;s reasonable for venture firms to request that their term-sheet not be shopped.  However, if you need more time to explore your options it&#8217;s also reasonable for you to ask for more time to finish your process.  Don&#8217;t allow a firm to pressure you into signing before you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p><strong><em>8.  Counsel</em></strong><strong>.  G</strong>et your own advocate.</p>
<p><strong><em>9.  Watch out for non-standard terms.</em></strong><strong> </strong> Naval discussed new terms that he has come across in venture termsheets &#8212; for example, one-sided binding termsheets.  Your lawyer should be able to provide guidance on what is standard versus non-standard.  It&#8217;s generally not worth your time fighting the industry norm on termsheets, but it&#8217;s also likely not worth your time to do business with venture firms who ask for one-sided terms that are non-standard.</p>
<p><strong><em>10.  Finally, don&#8217;t forget&#8230;</em></strong><em> </em>your 83(b) filings so that you can get the long-term capital gains clock ticking right away.</p>

</div>
<p>Our speaker for July will be <a href="http://blog.jhong.org/"><strong>James Hong</strong></a>, co-founder of the popular photo rating / casual dating website <strong> <a href="http://hotornot.com/">HOTorNOT</a></strong>.  James will speak about his experiences as a scrappy entrepreneur, <span class="highlight">how to bootstrap a startup</span>, and how he built a very <span class="highlight">profitable, subscription-based web business</span>.</p>
<p>James is a creative, unorthodox, and <strong>scrappy</strong> Silicon Valley entrepreneur.  He came up with the idea for HOTorNOT while drinking (heavily, we suspect) with fellow co-founder Jim Young in October of 2000.  In its first week the site topped 2M daily pageviews, and became an immediate cult hit.  With *zero* angel or VC funding, HOTorNOT grew quickly to a multi-million dollar subscription business.  After operating profitably out of a living room for much of its first eight years, the company was sold in early 2008 to an investment group for a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/11/hotornot-apparently-very-hot-acquired-for-20-million/">rumored $20M</a>.  If there&#8217;s a shrewder entrepreneur in the valley than James, we&#8217;d like to meet &#8216;em.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, James has been on temporary sabbatical from entrepreneurship &#8212; in other words he&#8217;s at home watching television, where his latest indulgence is MTV&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/dance_crew/series.jhtml"><em>America&#8217;s Best Dance Crew</em></a>.  James also enjoys spending time with a few of his angel investments, including <a href="http://slide.com">Slide</a> and <a href="http://mochimedia.com">Mochi Media</a>.  He is currently waiting for the economy to completely tank before embarking on another venture&#8230; or until Boogie Bots is voted off the show.  James is a graduate of UC Berkeley, where he earned a BS Electrical Engineering and an MBA from the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video interview of James and his thoughts on being scrappy, selling out, angel investing, and breakdancing:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTube Co-Founder Chad Hurley spoke to a packed house at the latest Startup2Startup event. Chad gave a very candid recount of his time starting YouTube.</p>
<p>Although originally aimed at online auctions or meeting new people, they eventually moved toward a general online video solution. Chad described the idea as branching out from their experiences at PayPal and their own complications with online video. The idea was to create a video experience that users could take with them similar to the way users could take the PayPal experience with them.</p>
<p>They started out of their garages, eventually taking up residence inside of Sequoia before taking a round from the same firm.</p>
<p>Chad confronted one of the chief criticisms raised against the site, that the site achieved much of its growth from illegal content hosted on the site. He pointed out that although other sites face similar problems, they haven&#8217;t achieved the same growth, because they weren&#8217;t able to achieve the same community as YouTube.</p>
<p>Although the choice to sell was hard, Chad said they eventually decided to sell to Google as the best path to growing and supporting the service.</p>
<p>Liz Gannes at <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/06/27/chad-hurley-how-we-did-it/">NewTeeVee</a> has more details and a video from the event below:</p>
