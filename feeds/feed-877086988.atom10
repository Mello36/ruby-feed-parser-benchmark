		<description><![CDATA[Ask your significant other to get this for you for Christmas.  Once I started reading, I did not (could not) put it down.  The online reviewers have covered the 10 000 hr rule (the amount you need to practise to become really good) , the rice paddy and Jewish lawyer legacy.   I was taken with his analysis of why Asian school children do so much better than North American - basically they do not have such long summer holidays. Kids need to be in school much much longer, especially with the time it takes to "get " math. (As an ex Math teacher I really understand this) The description of the KIPPS schools results is heady stuff.  Well written, well researched and no shortcuts were taken. (His end of book notes are almost another book). Loved it, buy it, read and enjoy it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ I think Godin is just getting better and better. Yes his books are short- tiny even. Yes they are very simple and single minded. Yet that is exactly why they are so good.  This one explains (along with other stuff) that:

    * Tribes have leaders,
    * Social media creates tribes
    * Skype created a tribe - and killed telco revenues
    * Wikipedia, Al Gore , Steve Jobs -all tribe builders
    * Crowds have no leaders
    * Crowds are tribes with no communication
    * Heretics make change
    * You decide to lead, not manage.
    * And "R U Stuck on Stupid?"

This is a short plain ride book, a quick after Christmas turkey read.  At the end Godin suggests that the best thing you can do with this book - is pass it onto someone else to spread the word about leading.

I liked it. A lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The author is a very seasoned successful marketer with a long list of very high impact campaigns to his credit.  On top of the experience he brings the knowledge and insight to make the sometime esoteric topic of marketing very simple and straightforward.  Our history in this market ties completely in what Bloom espouses.  He brings good value with this book , as he lays out not only what to do , but step by step how to do this work with your own people.  This is required reading for any marketer and a CEO would find this tremendously informative. I always enjoy the client stories and found his on NeoCitran/Theraflu,  Nestle, Southwest Airlines and T-Mobile especially compelling. Check out www.insideadvantage.org]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is pure Kawasaki. Smart, sassy and funny he writes the most pragmatic text in the industry when it comes to how to make the business work.  I could not put this down, as his non fiction reads like the most compelling fiction.  His prolific blogging shows in the clarity and tightness of his chapters.  If you are in a start-up - or it just feels like it, this book will help.  If you think you work for idiots, tight asses or assholes, this book will help. If you have just graduated this will help. If you are looking to sunset the industry this book will help.  I have added another good  Kawasaki book to my shelf and I advise you to buy it, enjoy it and review it from time to time. Its already a classic.   Yes I liked it.]]></description>

The irreverant guide to outsmarting, outmanaging, and outmarketing your competition. <a class="zem_slink" title="Guy Kawasaki" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki">Guy Kawasaki</a>. 2008. ISBN 9781591842231. This is pure Kawasaki. Smart, sassy and funny he still writes the most pragmatic text in the industry when it comes to how to make a business work.  I could not put this down, as his non fiction reads like compelling fiction.  His prolific blogging shows in the clarity and tightness of his chapters.  If you are in a start-up - or it just feels like it, this book will help.  If you work for idiots, tight asses or assholes, this book will help. If you have just graduated this will help. If you are looking to sunset the industry this book will help.  I have added another good  Kawasaki book to my shelf and I advise you to buy it, enjoy it and review it from time to time. Its already a classic.   Yes I liked it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Some of you may know that I am a recovering runner - still coming back from an Achilles injury last February. Up until I read this book I expected that I would face a series of re-occurrences of my leg injuries, one time hamstrings, another the quads, many sore ankles and then now a weakened Achilles.  I turned to swimming and thanks to Timothy Ferris (4 hr workweek) found a wonderful resource called Total Immersion by Terry Laughlin (wait for the review).  Laughlin referenced this book by Danny Dreyer.  What a find. As aging runners we now have a plan and a program that really pulls a lot of the "good stuff" together. Certainly over the years I have tried to run barefoot in the summer to smooth out my landing and take the hits off my heels. I have learned to lean forward  like the Kenyans. This book takes it all much further with a crystal clear logic and a full preventative and recovery plan.  If you harbor any desire to run like a youngster again or like me, a desire to enjoy it, and perhaps get back to a competitive level, I suggest this as a lifelong resource for you.  Very easy to read and thoroughly pragmatic. I am now running painfree!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good book for leaders like the VP and Director of Sales position, or any sales trainers.  I really enjoyed the style and viewpoint of this writer.  He has selected eight behaviors to focus on and they are very workable. I have bumped into several of them across different sales books:

   1. Start with a clean bill of health
   2. Spark a performance pursuit
   3. Get the express pass
   4. Play your depth chart
   5. Activate expectations
   6. Coach like a professional
   7. Offer RSVP feedback
   8. Heighten reward potency

With his background at Covey Institute, the author finds positive ways to help you get the most of out your team.  Since he is a sales person himself, he understands the power of story and  personal human anecdote. I got my copy at www.thecustomercollective.com

		<description><![CDATA[What a delightful book! If you have ever suspected that you are not always making the most logical decisions, This book provides resounding evidence that you are in very large company. I was astounded at what I learned in the 12 content chapters. If you are a student of pricing, decision making and human behavior this is the book for you. Unlike the anecdotal stories in Freakonnomics, and their ilk, this book has based real research and has science behind it. It makes the content that much more useful to all of us. The utility of the information in here for marketing is very high. The surprise of all this is that the book is very easy to read. A very good 4 hour airplane book.]]></description>

The hidden factors that shape our decisions. <a class="zem_slink" title="Dan Ariely" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely">Dan Ariely</a>. 2008. ISBN 9780061353239. What a delightful book!  If you have ever suspected that you are not always making the most logical decisions, This book provides resounding evidence that you are in very large company. I was astounded at what I learned in the 12 content chapters.  If you are a student of pricing, decision making and human behavior this is the book for you. Unlike the anecdotal stories in Freakonnomics, and their ilk, this book has based real research and has science behind it.  It makes the content that much more useful  to all of us.  The utility of the information in here for marketing is very high.  The surprise of all this is that the book is very easy to read. A very good 4 hour  airplane book.</p>
