You are 18 years old today. You can vote and fight, but you still can't drink...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this little ring in my lip on November 30th 1990. Back then I was one of maybe 2 dozen people in the country, and most definitely the only guy who also had a Dilbert day job. There was one other guy in Chicago, a girl in NYC, the guy in the Research book and a handful in San Francisco of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first 5 years I got asked 50 times a day, every day "Did that hurt?". Never any other question, and even in San Fran! So weird. I always answered with respect, but sometimes I wanted to scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's a different world, and lip rings are completely passé, but I still like the little guy.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/3840490651242847812/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=3840490651242847812' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/3840490651242847812'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/3840490651242847812'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/11/labret-comes-of-age.html' title='The Labret Comes of Age'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-1311000108156980535</id><published>2008-11-23T01:08:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-23T13:25:30.364-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Tonight I'm Gonna Nibble Like It's 177.6</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-208-705792.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-208-705784.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0943-783183.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0943-782617.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget 199.9.

So what's been going on since the last post?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided that losing weight was more fun than drinking. In the last 6 weeks I've managed to lose another 15 pounds. I can't remember when I last weighed under 190. Some time in the mid 90s I think. Now I'm shooting for 175 which I think was my weight when I was 13 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook disabled my account last week for using my name as my, um, name. It's all fixed up now. Ingy döt Net is legit and I even got them to lowercase the 'd' which you can't do using their site, and which, when I told them this, brought my dubious surname to their attention. More on this later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm hosting a couple of my favorite Nubile Perl Hackers, &lt;a href="http://blog.jrock.us/"&gt;jrockway&lt;/a&gt; from Chicago and &lt;a href="http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/"&gt;nothingmuch&lt;/a&gt; for Tel Aviv. I dressed both of them up in Lycra yesterday and made them bike around Lake Washington. One of them ended up in the hospital, but he's ok. Just a little scraped up. Nubile Perl Hackers are basically indestructible.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/6100662666485721071/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=6100662666485721071' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6100662666485721071'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6100662666485721071'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/10/nope.html' title='NOPE'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8636817299631628107</id><published>2008-09-05T21:06:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-06T02:17:01.576-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Tonight I'm Gonna Party Like It's 199.9</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/198-725066.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/198-724638.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I haven't blogged since June 30th. Another thing I haven't done since June is drink alcohol. At the end of June I decided to go on the wagon for the Summer. Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was surprisingly easy, and not at all what I expected. I still did all the things I normally do, just stone sober. Interestingly I still got a hangover now and then! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August I started wondering when I should have a drink again. Some old drinking friends of mine came through town, but still I resisted. One day I came up with a brilliant idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been running a lot this summer. I started running with the &lt;a href="http://www.seattlefrontrunners.org/"&gt;Seattle Frontrunners&lt;/a&gt; running club which meets very close to my house. I've also been losing a little weight. So I thought, I'll drink again whenever the scale reads under 200 lbs. (I started the Summer around 220 lbs.) But the brilliant part is that I decided, not only that... &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; I drink I'll have to weigh in under 200 again in order to drink again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to drink good bourbon, wine and beer. I also like to weigh under 200 lbs, but in the last 10 years I've only been there a handful of days. Now I can use one to encourage the other! Brilliant, if I do say so myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I finally reached my goal for the first time. I woke up weighing 205. In a heavy workout I can lose around 7 lbs. I ate breakfast and lunch and some water. Around 5pm, after work, I decided to go for it. When I left the house I weighed 207.  When I got back from a quick 40 mile bike ride I weighed 200.5. I decided to go on a short 2-3 mile run. This actually got me down to 197.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom's up!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8636817299631628107/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8636817299631628107' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8636817299631628107'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8636817299631628107'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/09/tonight-im-gonna-party-like-its-1999.html' title='Tonight I&apos;m Gonna Party Like It&apos;s 199.9'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8865485424620632186</id><published>2008-06-30T14:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-30T16:26:37.494-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Coffee &amp; Diffie</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0881-736101.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0881-735486.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been hanging out in Palo Alto for the last week, meeting new coworkers at &lt;a href="http://www.socialtext.com"&gt;Socialtext&lt;/a&gt;, and visiting old friends. This last Saturday morning I made a new friend. I was waiting for my coffee and I spied a man sitting at a table using a laptop. Not a rarity around these parts by any means. But this was a man I was pretty sure I'd seen before at a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp"&gt;Foo Camp&lt;/a&gt; some years ago... "Excuse me, are you &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie"&gt;Whit Diffie&lt;/a&gt;?" "Yes, I am." "Hi, my name's Ingy döt Net"... Whit and I talked a bit and then I ran off to have breakfast with &lt;a href="http://www.lyssakaehler.net/"&gt;Lyssa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I ran into Whit again and we ended up talking for about an hour or so. I think I am cursed with this condition that when I meet someone with interesting ideas, I feel compelled to turn those ideas into projects. Whit left me with two interesting ideas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) While discussing the concept of "ingy.net", he impressed on my that a query url is a long lasting resource of good information on a subject. For instance &lt;a href="http://ingy.net"&gt;http://ingy.net&lt;/a&gt; (this blog) may become dead some day, but &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ingy+dot+net"&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=ingy+dot+net&lt;/a&gt; is much more robust. This led me to the idea of creating a blogware wrapper, that basically contained the latest google info about me, without me needing to lift a finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have create &lt;a href="http://i.ingy.net"&gt;http://i.ingy.net&lt;/a&gt;. For now, it is a simple redirect to google, but may be more interesting at some point. It might be an interesting meme to make domains like 'i.' or 'iii.' to mean, "general information". At this point "www" has very little meaning, but lots of people type it in regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Whit is interested in &lt;a href="http://www.nsa.gov/"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; factoids and during some talk about this and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki"&gt;Wikis&lt;/a&gt;, we came to the conclusion that a wiki would be a decent tool for a group of people with that common interest to share what they know. The main difference is that this data is more structured in nature and wikis are pretty much about free form content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This discussion rekindled my interest in two older ideas of mine: &lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/CogBase/CogBase.html"&gt;CogBase&lt;/a&gt;. I think that there is a lot of potential in what I would called a "typed wiki", a wiki who's pages have a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; and that type implies a certain &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; (aka required data). That way you could set up a wiki that contained both free form prose, and also pages that made you fill in a form for certain data. Imagine a baseball wiki. You could have pages on players that required all the typical "baseball card" info and also free formed pages that talked about things like a certain famous game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whit was quite an interesting man, but given my current project schedule, perhaps dangerous to meet with too often. ;-)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8865485424620632186/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8865485424620632186' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8865485424620632186'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8865485424620632186'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/06/coffee-diffie.html' title='Coffee &amp; Diffie'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-4195883011269629544</id><published>2008-06-23T17:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-23T18:18:41.390-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gif'/><title type='text'>A Twelve Pack of YAPC</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/stage-right-701908.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/stage-right-701904.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got back from Chicago. I really love that place. I usually tell people, "Chicago is a nice place to live, but you wouldn't want to visit there", but I had a great visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went salmon fishing on Lake Michigan with my dad and my brother. We caught 6 fish and drank a few beers, then we met up with mom for a nice family dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got to see my old friends Dave, Brooke, Margy and Emily. They really took good care of me. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I went to Chicago was to speak at my 12th &lt;a href="http://www.yapc.org/"&gt;YAPC&lt;/a&gt; conference. That's me in that picture at the end of my first ever &lt;a href="http://worldnakedbikeride.com/"&gt;naked&lt;/a&gt; impromptu  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk"&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been to 6 North America YAPCs (2001,2002,2003,2005,2006,2008); 5 in Asia (2004-2008) and YAPC Europe in Amsterdam (2001). I've given talks at every one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year's YAPC was really inspiring to me. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall"&gt;Larry Wall&lt;/a&gt;'s talk was the best one I've ever seen him give. I think it rekindled my spirit to work on the following major (for various definitions of major) open source projects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yaml.org/"&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://trac.cdent.org/trac/"&gt;C'Dent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6"&gt;Perl 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jemplate.net/"&gt;Jemplate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/"&gt;Moose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;as well as my many Perl modules like &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Inline/"&gt;Inline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/IO-All/"&gt;IO::All&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/pQuery/"&gt;pQuery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Install/"&gt;Module::Install&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Compile/"&gt;Module::Compile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JS/"&gt;JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WikiText/"&gt;WikiText&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Vroom/"&gt;Vroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of YAPC is always seeing your old Perl friends and making new ones. Too many people to list here. I love y'all, and y'all know who you are.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/4195883011269629544/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=4195883011269629544' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/4195883011269629544'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/4195883011269629544'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/06/twelve-pack-of-yapc.html' title='A Twelve Pack of YAPC'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-26099275489114864</id><published>2008-06-06T08:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-06T09:38:53.603-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Good Morning Ingy</title><content type='html'>Last week I got back from a couple months in Taiwan, with a side trip to Tokyo. Nice to be back to some proper Seattle June weather... cold, wet, miserable. Ah well, we still got the most best coffee houses and I live right in the middle of the that sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I've always gone to the nearest cafe, Online Cafe, for my morning americano. While the coffee and people there are awesome... that's  just criminal. Within 8 blocks of me there is Victrola, Caffe Vita, Bauhaus, Vivace, Fuel, Republik, Stumptown, Presse, and oh so many more. I love these cafes but never go to them on any regular basis. But this week two things changed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became (at least temporarily) a Morning Person. I thought I could avoid the jetlag coming back from Taiwan this year for sure. I did it last year, but alas, this year I got it bad. I woke up every morning at 2:30 or 3am for a whole week. Luckily Victrola opens at 5:30am so by then I was stoked to do something... like get my  coffee. On the second day I figured out how to carry a  coffee on my motorcycle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0794-741340.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0794-740643.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Ducati mod. A MotorCycleCoffeeCozy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can easily go check out a new cafe every morning for like the next 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taiwan was a great trip. I got to hang out with old friends Gugod and TvCafe. The Kogai family treated me to 10 days of bliss in Tokyo. Larry and Gloria Wall were there as well (Perl geek nirvana). I actually sat next to the same person on both of my flights to and from Taiwan and get this... he lives 2 blocks from me in Seattle and his name is Jimi Hendrix! We're going to hang out this weekend. Lyssa from LA came out to spend the last two weeks of Taiwan and Tokyo with me. She really knows Tokyo and I know my way around Taiwan, so it was a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to be back in Seattle and America for a while. Obama FTW!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/26099275489114864/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=26099275489114864' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/26099275489114864'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/26099275489114864'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/06/good-morning-ingy.html' title='Good Morning Ingy'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8107584619021489827</id><published>2008-03-10T14:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-10T19:19:07.621-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Comprehensive Programming Archive Network</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-141-771421.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-141-771416.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I uploaded &lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/"&gt;CPAN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True. The 'j' in that sentence stands for JavaScript, and the 'P' stands for Perl. So why put a top notch JavaScript library on the world renowned archive network traditionally used for Perl?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it's all just about programming. I have been a major Perl module author since 2000AD. Last time I checked, less than 10 people have more Perl modules on CPAN. For the last 3 years I have been hacking more JavaScript than Perl. I do this mostly for work, but since &lt;a href="http://www.socialtext.com/"&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt; supports Open Source, I have released much of this code as JavaScript modules on &lt;a href="http://openjsan.org/"&gt;JSAN&lt;/a&gt;. I happen to be the only person in the world with a module that is both on JSAN and CPAN; the &lt;a href="http://jemplate.net/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module, because it is half Perl and half JavaScript. (It lets Perl's famous Template Toolkit be used in JavaScript).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JSAN was a really good idea, and led to some key people porting important parts of the Perl packaging framework to JavaScript. Especially the test framework. The result is that there is a fairly standard way to package JavaScript modules, especially if you are a CPAN guy like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that there are only a very small handful of folks paying any attention to the upkeep of JSAN. Truthfully JSAN will never be close to what CPAN is. Fortunately, I have found out it really doesn't need to be. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started toying with the idea of putting other languages on CPAN about 5 years ago, but decided against it after discussing it with some Perl mongers at &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home"&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt;. I also started FreePAN.org in 2003 with the goal of making a CPAN for all languages, but that project never really took off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks ago I started rethinking the whole thing. Certainly most languages have their own strong communities and distribution systems in 2008. But JavaScript (as a language) really doesn't. And almost every project I work on these days involves both Perl and JavaScript. And JSAN made JavaScript modules look like Perl modules. So I decided to look into how hard it would be to leverage CPAN for JavaScript's benefit. It was surprisingly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that if you put any file in the &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;lib/&lt;/span&gt; directory of a CPAN module it will get installed. So, for example, &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;lib/jQuery.js&lt;/span&gt; would be installed when the user runs &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;make install&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I decided that it wouldn't be too cool to put the jQuery package on CPAN and let the user figure out that it was JavaScript and not Perl. Besides, there is already a Perl module called &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JQuery/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;! I decided to put all these modules in the JS namespace. So jQuery becomes &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JS-jQuery/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;JS-jQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on CPAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what use is it to get JavaScript modules installed on your machine if JavaScript can't find them? I wrote a companion module called &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JS/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;JS.pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This module lets you run a command like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;    &gt; js-cpan jQuery.js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;    /Library/Perl/5.8.8/JS/jQuery.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can get the path names of the JavaScript modules you have on your system. You can then copy or symlink these modules into your web app. With a *nix command like this for example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;    ln -s `js-cpan jQuery.js` jquery.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can distribute Perl web apps on CPAN that require certain JavaScript modules, and have them be included in the standard way as Perl module prerequisites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, I plan to just upload my own JavaScript code to CPAN. But lately, almost everything I write in JavaScript relies on jQuery. It's just &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; good. If JavaScript 2.0 ever comes out, it should have the jQuery core included in the spec. :)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8107584619021489827/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8107584619021489827' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8107584619021489827'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8107584619021489827'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/03/comprehensive-programming-archive.html' title='Comprehensive Programming Archive Network'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5082646728840720236</id><published>2008-02-06T18:40:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-06T19:41:42.888-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Year of the Wiki</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/IMG_2790-725503.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/IMG_2790-724254.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Happy new year! It's Chinese New Year. The year of the Rat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rat. Hmm. I don't think I want to spend this whole year giving honor to the Rat. See, I live in America. I've spent the last 7 years under the Rat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm actually very excited about this upcoming year, and the possibilities for doing good things and creating great things. I'm particularly excited about Wikis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2003 I wrote some Wiki software called &lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt;. For a while it really started a wildfire, especially in the world of Perl. I set Kwiki up to make the software itself a collaborative experience, much in the way the Wiki is about collaborative content. In the following months and years, many Perl hackers hacked over 250 Kwiki Plugins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Kwiki fell to the sidelines for the last couple years. Last winter it started to surge again only to be stopped dead in its tracks by my accident in Taiwan in the Spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am almost fully recovered and my enthusiasm for Wiki and Kwiki is back in full swing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent this last week at Socialtext in Palo Alto. Socialtext is the original Wiki company and my employer of the last 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last weekend I spent 48 hours in San Francisco, scheming and hacking with Eugene Eric Kim (eek) the father of the Purple Wiki. Eugene and I crafted some very ambitious Wiki plans for 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I am at the Portland Wiki Wednesday, sitting across the table from Ward Cunningham, the inventor of the Wiki itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's definitely been a Wiki Week. I'm getting the feeling that maybe it should be a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wiki Year&lt;/span&gt;. With all due respect to the Chinese, I declare the next year, starting right now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;The Year of the Wiki!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to join me, visit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;http://www.kwiki.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;#kwiki on irc.freenode.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/5082646728840720236/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=5082646728840720236' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5082646728840720236'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5082646728840720236'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/02/year-of-wiki.html' title='The Year of the Wiki'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-1559340787095737307</id><published>2007-11-28T19:53:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-01T18:39:13.700-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Hackers Will Always Overcome</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-84-734784.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-84-734780.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I bought a ticket to go to Taiwan in December, but later decided to postpone the trip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The departure date was next week so I knew I'd better call today and cancel it. I called the airline at 5:15pm and they told me to use their website to cancel it. So I hung up and surfed on over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After finally navigating this very crufty site to the cancellation page, I filled out the form and clicked the CONFIRM button. The page simply zipped to the top and did nothing. Strange. I tried again. Same thing. I looked around to find a better button to click. Nada.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So being a hacker I viewed the source code for the button and saw that it called the "validate_data" javascript function. I tried entering in some bad data, and it gave me alerts saying that my data was bad. Then I fixed all the bad data again and nothing. again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At this point I said fµck it and called them back... I'm sorry, the office is now closed... office hours are from 9am to 5:30pm...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; FµCK! This time I really said ƒµçk it!! I'm a hacker! I'm going to hack this site and make it work!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I fired up Firebug and did a &lt;tt&gt;document.getElementsByTagName('form')&lt;/tt&gt;. Cool! Just one form. I clicked on the result and firebug showed me the guts of the form. It all looked good. Then I saw &lt;tt&gt;onsubmit="return validate_data()"&lt;/tt&gt;. That stupid stupid JS function. &lt;tt&gt;document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].removeAttribute('onsubmit')&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buh-bye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now I went back and clicked CONFIRM again. Nothing... Hmm. Is this button even part of the form? Oh ƒµçk it.

It makes me believe in life a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delightful man named Fling, whom I've never met before just walked up to me whilst I was working at Online Cafe. Yes, Fling. Yes, Online Cafe. None of this is made up. (I'm just not that creative!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fling asked me "Is your name Ingy"... Yes... I found your passport on the street... (jaw drops)... wait here and I'll run home and get it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two nights ago I got back from visiting my coworkers in Vancouver. I guess in the process of unpacking my car, the passport fell out. I had actually noticed it right away, and figured it was safe inside the car somewhere. Today when I got to the cafe, it crossed my mind to go get it from the car. Luckily I put it off and stayed in the cafe so Fling could find me, instead of going into a major freakout that would have ensued, since I need that passport to get back to Vancouver tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fling rocks. Life is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of life, I attended the funeral reception for the passing on of my good friend Meghan's&lt;br /&gt;father, yesterday. The Tesh-s are a great family, and we all had a good time enjoying the comfort of friendships, and toasting to the life of Don Tesh. I only met him once, but he had an important effect on my life... He was the retired doctor who referred me to my most excellent wrist surgeon in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest in peace, Don.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/6660080807286313043/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=6660080807286313043' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6660080807286313043'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6660080807286313043'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/10/fling-me-passport.html' title='Fling, Me, A Passport'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5327378868013006281</id><published>2007-09-11T22:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-09-12T11:57:19.933-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Alter Ego And Edamame</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/1364627078_d3c1276e8e-780770.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/1364627078_d3c1276e8e-780762.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I had dinner with &lt;a href="http://ingypants.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-dinner-with-ingy.html"&gt;Ingy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://ingypants.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-dinner-with-ingy.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I got together and dined with my local alter ego, Ingy Pants. We ate at Seattle's best sushi restaurant, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=maneki+seattle&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;Maneki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We babeled a bit about French and Chinese language, various arm surgeries, and the 4 "P" languages (Perl, Python, PHP and Ruby).

But then I get wanderlust and takes to all kinds of great places in this great world. Still I have my favorites. The are the cities that I just feel at home in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;新竹 （Ｈsinchu)&lt;/span&gt; - This is the Taiwan city that I lived in for 6 months. Also the one that recently tried to eat my wrist. Still I love it and can't wait to get back. I &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; learn Chinese before I die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/span&gt; - Couver is a techie's haven. And it is naturally beautiful. And full of my favorite people. And it has the Excellent Eatery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Portland&lt;/span&gt; - Portland peeps are real. I love it there. Where else can you find over half a dozen movie theaters with beer and pizza?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Seattle&lt;/span&gt; - You always get me back. But I'll always leave you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hmm. What do these places all have in common? Great bicycle riding. Decent weather year round (except 新竹 in the summer). Ocean, mountains, flats and lush green. Great food (the best outside of Chicago, which is really the only city I can recommend for food). Technology. High cost of living (Couver is a bitch). Great people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'm ready to make a next move, Seattle... where shall I go?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/4769412926996800435/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=4769412926996800435' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/4769412926996800435'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/4769412926996800435'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/08/trail-of-four-cities.html' title='Trail of Four Cities'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5168822042538569354</id><published>2007-06-27T15:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-28T13:33:44.521-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Post Op Days</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF1031-716293.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF1031-715701.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been almost a month since I wrote here. A week after I wrote that I went to the Swedish hospital for wrist surgery. In a word, the surgery was "good". The doc keeps his cards pretty close to his chest, but I could tell he was pretty excited about the turnout. That's the good news...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...life has been so low key since then. My wrist is going to be in the healing phase for the next year I think. It doesn't bend so much now, and I guess fixing that takes a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have been steadily doing some low key but fun stuff. I went on a trip to Portland last weekend. I love that town. I'm always tempted to move back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past weekend my buddies Tatsuhiko Miyagawa and Steve Howell, were both in town. Monday night we all went to watch the Mariners beat the crap out of the Red Sox. I don't go to many baseball games, but can someone please tell me why every other fan at Safeco Field was cheering for Boston?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Miyagawa had a good time. I'm not in the best shape to host people I think. But the weather was great and we got out a bit. Friday night I had my first BBQ party in nearly a year. I'm ready for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ever since this surgery I've been sleeping more than ever. At first I thought it was the sleep drugs, but I've stopped taking those, and I'm still a zombie half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else? I've been spending some time writing my new Perl module, YAML::XS. It's exciting because Perl has been dieing for top notch YAML support, and YAML::XS is just that. It is a C binding to Kirill Siminov's libyaml library. The "top notch" credit all goes to Kirill. libyaml is simply amazing. I think Kirill is to programming, what Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was to music. Well I just get the feeling that Kirill makes no mistakes. I haven't found a single bug in this opus of code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I got out on my motorcycle! Technically I should probably wait a couple more weeks, but man... I gotta live. It was great to ride a few miles. Yesterday I rode my road bike for a bit, and last week I started running again. I'm still loving being alive. I think getting the pace of your life slowed down can be a good thing. It helps you notice all the good stuff around you.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/5168822042538569354/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=5168822042538569354' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5168822042538569354'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5168822042538569354'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/06/its-been-almost-month-since-i-wrote.html' title='Post Op Days'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8900582427570006989</id><published>2007-05-30T13:12:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-30T13:28:35.182-07:00</updated><title type='text'>One Less Fixie</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0974-746080.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0974-745142.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I talked to the doc yesterday. Last week he told me the "external fixator" would need to be on 8 weeks total, or about 3 more weeks. But then yesterday he talked me into doing a wrist surgery next week. Since I agreed, he now wants to take the bionics off the arm ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny... I completely agree with him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today at 4pm I become a relatively normal looking dude again. No more wrist piercing jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the surgery, I think he's going to break off the end of my radius into a few pieces and do his best to make it more like it should be. Then he'll hold it all steady with internal screwed in plates. What could possibly go wrong?!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8900582427570006989/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8900582427570006989' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8900582427570006989'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8900582427570006989'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/one-less-fixie.html' title='One Less Fixie'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8863215351804982558</id><published>2007-05-20T16:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-20T17:22:16.538-07:00</updated><title type='text'>index.yaml</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0902-727096.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0902-726139.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent part of my morning at Target and Barnes &amp; Noble. I'm not much of a mall guy at all, and I never ever buy anything from St4rbucks. Still I do like getting my undies at Target and B&amp;amp;N was next door, and my friend wanted to get a Sudoku book. So I do what I always do in a corporate chain book store... I look in the computer section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must first say that I am happy to report that computer books are finally on the decline. There's just half a normal sized aisle's worth, and half of that is mandatory Microcrap stuff (this is Seattle after all). Perl is (sadly) all but gone. The only new rage seems to be Ajax and a gaggle of JavaScript books. Nothing wrong with that, just not too exciting to me. I mean how much can you really say about either?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to look at the indexes of some new books and see if there was the word "YAML" in any of them. (Yes, ego browsing). First I have to say that not many computer terms at all begin with the letter Y. I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;yield&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YUI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAGNI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Kind of redundant. YUI *is* Yahoo! (and also YAGNI ihmo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did find a few books with YAML in the index. At least one had a decent amount of YAML in the content of the book. Here's what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Rails-Scott-Raymond/dp/0596527446"&gt;Ajax on Rails&lt;/a&gt; - YAML isn't needed in Ajax so much, but Ruby and Rails really like YAML. This book only mentioned YAML in passing, and errantly thought it stood for Yet Another Markup Language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly-Lucas-Carlson/dp/0596523696"&gt;Ruby Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; - Ruby has shipped with native YAML support for years. This book had quite a bit of YAML info/examples/usage/etc. It seemed fairly accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Web-Development-Rails-Programmers/dp/097669400X"&gt;Agile Web Development with Rails&lt;/a&gt; - This book got the name wrong too but just by one letter: "YAML Ain't a Markup Language".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intermediate-Perl-Randal-L-Schwartz/dp/0596102062"&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/a&gt; - This book (written about my native computer tongue) talks about YAML. Unfortunately the examples are really old and dated (YAML 1.0) even though the book was reprinted in 2006. Also the book attributes the YAML creation to some bloke named "Brian Ingerson". We all know YAML was invented by Evans, Ben-Kiki and döt Net.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perl-Hacks-Programming-Debugging-Surviving/dp/0596526741"&gt;PERL HACKS&lt;/a&gt; - This one blasphemously puts Perl in ALL CAPS on the cover, even though the author's name is purposefully all lower case. The content contains one HACK involving YAML.pm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm sure there are more books out there that mention YAML. It got me thinking about maybe writing a book about YAML. It also got me thinking about how to start getting YAML support in browsers.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8863215351804982558/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8863215351804982558' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8863215351804982558'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8863215351804982558'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/indexyaml.html' title='index.yaml'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-2846260925989211487</id><published>2007-05-18T13:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-19T00:37:30.764-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Grooming is Creepy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0910-746754.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0910-745933.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0912-798098.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0912-796797.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF!

Well it started then... It's still being invented at some levels. I happened to be one of the primary 3 guys who spent several years and countless email hours inventing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; showed up on the scene around 2005(??). JSON didn't need so much inventing because it is a subset of JavaScript. JSON and YAML have a lot in common and also distinct differences, but I can't seem to find any web page that talks much about it. So I'll do it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically YAML and JSON aren't even related. And just for the record neither are YAML and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia pretty muchs gets it right in the first sentence definition for each of these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XML is a ... markup language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAML is a ... data serialization format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSON is a ... data interchange format.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Except that "YAML (and begrudgingly XML) is also a useful data interchange format", there is really little crossover in definition. YAML and JSON are not markup. XML and JSON are not intended for serious serialization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;NOTE: I'm not talking about XML from here on. This post is about YAML and JSON.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But YAML and JSON have a common spirit. They both are programming language agnostic. They both are centered around hashes, arrays and scalars (or whatever you call these if you aren't a Perl guy like me). This makes them really attractive in Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby and (of course) JavaScript because these modern languages are also based on hashes, arrays and scalars as their primary data model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, early on in JSON's existence, someone noticed that &lt;a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/yamlIsJson.html"&gt;JSON is a pure subset of YAML&lt;/a&gt;. Well this wasn't completely true, but enough so that both camps adjusted their specs to make it true. The whole concept is freaky because YAML showed up years before. My only rationale is that YAML was so ambitious. We tried to make it look like everything. And we got really lucky with JSON. Anyway it's all history at this point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are the differences then? In a nutshell JSON handles all the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;common&lt;/span&gt; cases for turning data into text and  back into data. YAML handles &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; the cases so it can be a serious data serialization language. This makes JSON almost trivial to implement, and YAML almost impossible. So even though YAML was first, JSON caught on like wildfire. Since JSON is a subset, it really doesn't have anything YAML doesn't. Except a cool logo. YAML has no logo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a list of what YAML does have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAML has two ways to show collections (hashes and arrays): (Python-like) indentation and (JSON-like) braces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAML has many scalar quoting styles. Unquoted, double quoted, single quoted, literal block, and flow block. JSON uses double quotes for all strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAML has data typing. It uses a &lt;a href="http://www.taguri.org/"&gt;taguri&lt;/a&gt; based system for explicit typing, and also supports implicit typing. JSON supports only String, Number and Boolean  scalar types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAML supports &lt;a href="http://yaml.org/spec/cvs/current.html#id863390"&gt;multiple references&lt;/a&gt; to identical nodes, including circular references. JSON does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In YAML, a hash (mapping) key can be any node (including another hash, array or aliased node reference). In JSON a key is always a String.  It should be noted that YAML goes beyond the capabilities of most programming languages in this regard. Only Ruby has full object key support, afaik.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAML allows a "stream" to consist of multiple "documents", or top-level nodes. These can be any node of course. In JSON you can only have one top level object, and it must be a hash or an array (not just a scalar).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;That's about it, but that's a ton. Especially in the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all of these things make YAML a great serialization format, and avoiding all these things make JSON a great data exchange format.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/1846805756108883411/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=1846805756108883411' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/1846805756108883411'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/1846805756108883411'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/yaml-and-json.html' title='YAML and JSON'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8128742731451751545</id><published>2007-05-14T17:28:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-14T19:53:09.024-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Back in the USSA</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0888-796088.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0888-795232.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a week! Been so busy, ain't even had time to blog it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my flight home was fine, even though I was worried sick when I got on that 747 pointed East. The doctor told me I shouldn't fly for a month, so of course I'm sure my guts are gonna go splaying when we hit 10,000 feet. I take a Xanax to cool out, and I was totally fine. No rib pain nothing. The flight attendants seemed extra nice to me  because I was "injury boy".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I was the only one who didn't sleep on the flight which was my plan actually. The plane landed at 7pm, so why sleep and make it impossible to sleep later. Then again I have Ambien so why am I worried in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got home and called a few friends to meet me for a few drinks before bedcrashtime. I called my best friend Larry, but ended up not-drunk-but-just-as-incoherently-dialing &lt;a href="http://www.wall.org/%7Elarry/"&gt;Larry Wall&lt;/a&gt; instead. It was bizarre. "Hey you're not Larry"... "Yeah this is Larry"... "Look, stop playing games, put Larry on"... "This *is* Larry"... "Whatever! Whoever you are, tell Larry Ingy called"... *click* ZOMG. Embarrassing. I just happened to have Larry Wall's number in my phone. Never called him before. Get some drinks with Larry and Helen and Meghan and Terra and hit the hay. *HARD*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day I get up and drive to Vancouver BC for the Socialtext Great Couver Hackathon. Good to meet my coworkers face2face. Lots of new faces 2 face... Next day head back to Seattle. Meghan's 3 day birthday procession requires my presence. *EPIC*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I somehow survive this girl's 28th trip around the sun party. Sick people are supposed to rest. Then again all people only live once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot's of other stuff going on. Beach Club 2007 officially started today. Helen and I are considering moving to a new place this summer. Watched 5 straight episodes of 6 Feet Under. See my American Hand Doctor in 2 days. Turns out he is a customer of Larry's bike shop! Crazy small world. Oh yeah, Larry totally customized my exoskeleton with some skillful use of his bike shop's die grinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I start writing &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7EINGY/YAML-LibYAML-0.01/lib/YAML/LibYAML.pm"&gt;YAML::LibYAML&lt;/a&gt; this week. This will be a great tool for Perl people. I'll write more on that tomorrow.

Taiwan must not want me to go cuz they charged me 3000 taiwanese pesos to ship my bike. I'm 3 grand poorer, taiwanesewise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then they asked me if my arm was OK... "Great" I say. No need telling em about my ribs. OK looks like I'm gonna make it, got my ticket. Got a bowl of beef noodles in me. And a cup of joe. And my electric pocket sudoku game.

Gugod and I went to our usual place. I guess it's called 肥仔龍, which means "Fat Dragon". It was crowded as usual. The crowd sitting on the outside of a huge horseshoe shaped grill with two chefs in the middle cooking their butts off. I got the beef and seafood set meal. Basically food keeps getting dumped on your plate, and eventually you are full. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I bought a half dozen really fun Taiwan scooter helmets. Cost maybe $35usd. Gonna buy  few more and make an art exhibit at &lt;a href="http://www.libertybars.com/"&gt;Liberty Bar&lt;/a&gt; sometime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I'm hanging at Gugod's &lt;a href="http://opcafe.net/"&gt;OPCafé&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite being the creator of Perl's &lt;a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/02/inline.html"&gt;Inline.pm&lt;/a&gt;, I really don't know C or XS. Not anymore at least. I'm in total nööb möde. Hopefully I will upload the first version of YAML2 to &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/"&gt;CPAN&lt;/a&gt; tonight.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/632689066298306542/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=632689066298306542' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/632689066298306542'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/632689066298306542'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/sunday-hanging-from-op.html' title='Sunday Hanging from OP'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-2704710536971922915</id><published>2007-05-05T04:04:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-05T04:34:38.501-07:00</updated><title type='text'>YAML 2.ö</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0674-740339.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0674-739608.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I am starting to implement YAML2.pm, which is a replacement for my Perl module YAML.pm. YAML.pm has been around has been around since 2001. It is one of the oldest YAML implementations and one of the worst. My fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer I agreed with The Perl Foundation to produce a replacement by porting Kirill Siminov's &lt;a href="http://pyyaml.org/wiki/"&gt;Python/C YAML work&lt;/a&gt; to Perl. YAML2 is my latest go around at this work. It will start by creating a wrapper for Kirill's libyaml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will become available on CPAN a YAML2, and will be backwards compatible with YAML.pm. When it is stable I will make YAML.pm be the same code, and phase out YAML2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you non-programmers YAML is a computer language for expressing computer &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; in a human readable/friendly manner. I started the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML"&gt;YAML project&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 with Clark Evans and Oren Ben-Kiki. Now it has become a pretty big deal in the computer world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, my Taiwan trip is winding down and I'm getting ready to return to Seattle on Tuesday. Given that my guts don't explode on the 747 I have a pretty busy week on my return. My company's programmers are meeting en masse this week in Vancouver BC, and I'd like to join them for at least some of the fun. Also it's Miss Meghan Tesh's ?? birthday and from what I know so far, a Tesh birthday is a MAJOR event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is I run out of all drugs on about Tuesday. I hope Gugod will be a good sport and take me by the hospital for a refill before I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Gugod, I got to meet his wonderful parents last night. They stopped by to check out how ole Ingus was doing. Evidently they want to cook me dinner on Monday.

She was sitting on the couch next to me practicing her electric. I had to ask her to borrow the thing. I've been wondering if, since bike and motorcycle riding are straight out, can I still play my guitar when I get home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly no. It hurts like hell. Especially bar chords. My wrist doesn't bend at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I ended up having good  conversations with Jessie. She's in university and a rebellious post rocker. She's been to Philly and speaks English way better than she thinks she does. Her band covers Radiohead, and Paul Gilbert is her guitar hero. She drew this sketch of ole Ingus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0701-740329.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0701-739573.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hmm.

No cops or insurance people. Just a day in Taiwan to spend how I like. Lately here's what I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good night sleep and wake up by noon.  That's what I did first today. I can actually sleep pretty well. The pain level, given the right drugs is now bearable. My arm always hurts but I can kinda ignore it most of the time. The funny thing is that the metal framework part is not what hurts at all. It's mostly the support system. The shoulder, elbow and inner forearm. Ouch. @#$%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I woke up I jumped in the shower. Everything takes a little longer these days, and I needed to get dressed and packed by 12:30 to get a taxi to the train station. I said my morning pleasantries to Gugod and hit the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about this train. It's totally new and all the rave, and it just rocks harder than, say, Pat Benetar. Destination 台北 (Taipei). In the old days (last year) this meant a 2.5 hour bus ride from 新竹(Hsinchu) but this is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_High_Speed_Rail"&gt;HIGH SPEED RAIL&lt;/a&gt;. 35 minutes of total comfort for under $10USD. The 台北 station is also a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_Rapid_Transit_System"&gt;MRT&lt;/a&gt; station, so I switch trains, 10 minutes and 4 stations later I'm at the neighborhood of my favorite 台北 cafe, &lt;a href="http://www.morelax.com/"&gt;mo!relax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's now 1:55. The cafe is just opening and my new friend and owner of the joint, 詩琪 (Shi Qi) is there to greet me. She even takes the time to make me my first Americano in almost a week. Today is gonna be a good one!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/218095913822589738/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=218095913822589738' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/218095913822589738'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/218095913822589738'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/high-speed-way-to-get-morelaxed.html' title='The High Speed Way To Get Mo!Relaxed'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry></feed>
