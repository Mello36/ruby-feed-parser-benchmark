			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick post to note that I won&#8217;t be able to blog over the next few weeks. I&#8217;m just back from a business trip to Weybridge, then I&#8217;m off to Kiev on business all next week, then a week in Mallorca for my first proper holiday of year, then a few days in Ibiza spending all my money on overpriced booze and overpriced clubs! *Phew* <img src='http://www.guyrintoul.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> Wish me luck in not collapsing from exhaustion, and assuming I&#8217;m not asleep for the whole of next month I&#8217;ll be back to blogging once I&#8217;m back in early September. In the meantime, follow what I&#8217;m up to on <a href="http://twitter.com/grintoul">Twitter</a> and see where in the world I am on <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/grintoul/public">Dopplr</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I stand by <a href="http://www.guyrintoul.com/2008/08/10/media-bias-over-south-ossetia/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a> that initial media reporting on the Russia/Georgia fighting was rather one-sided, it seems that Russia has now gone beyond simply &#8220;protecting the South Ossetians&#8221;. As <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7554507.stm">BBC News reports</a>, Western leaders are increasingly worried that Russia is now outright invading Georgia - and it seems they <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7553390.stm">aren&#8217;t quite sure</a> what to do to stop it and the potential chaos it could unleash. They had the benefit of the doubt at first, but now Russia&#8217;s brazen push deeper into Georgia proper raises worrying questions about how far the country will go to &#8220;protect&#8221;, regain and hold the territory of a neighbouring country which they&#8217;ve long wanted back.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LA506699.htm">Reuters reports</a> that Russia is complaining of Western media bias in reports on the South Ossetian conflict. While I&#8217;d normally greet complaints of bias from the Kremlin with a hearty laugh and a cry of &#8220;hypocrites&#8221;, in this case they may actually have a point. All coverage of the violence seems to be centring on Russia&#8217;s part in the aggression, completely ignoring the fact that (1) Georgian forces started the violence; (2) South Ossetians in general support Russia over Georgia; (3) the breakaway nature of the provence means that reports of injured &#8220;Georgians&#8221; are misleading; and (4) Georgia seems to be at least equally responsible for the loss of life and infrastructure. While it&#8217;s never easy to cut through disinformation, it does seem that for once the Kremlin may have a valid point about the Western media. Still, &#8220;the boy who cried wolf&#8221; and &#8220;pot calling the kettle black&#8221; both spring to mind&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jude Umeh outlines an interesting idea on his <acronym title="British Computer Society">BCS</acronym> blog on DRM. He notes the recent Memorandum of Understanding between the UK recording industry and six major ISPs, which essentially means that ISPs will monitor their networks for illegal filesharing in return for the music industry relaxing its previously zero-tolerance, anti-consumer position. Umeh notes that, on the face of it, this would seem to be a win-win for all parties involved. However, there&#8217;s still no getting away from the fact that this move to &#8220;ISP-RM&#8221;, as he terms it, involves ISPs monitoring their users&#8217; activity. Whatever the benefits, if it involves virtual snooping, the ends don&#8217;t always justify the means.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7542849.stm">recent article</a> on the BBC website, Bill Thompson rails against Apple&#8217;s closed approach to security. He notes, quite rightly, that Microsoft has in recent years made great strides in their approach to security, including open discussion about the purpose of updates and fixes, allowing administrators to choose what to install. Apple, on the other hand, has a very closed approach, which leaves users in the dark as to the purpose of the updates they install. While I do agree that openness is preferable and a far better model, Thompson does miss one very key point - the reason Microsoft have been forced to become so open about security is that they&#8217;re so bad at it in the first place, and need to convince users that they know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Barton takes an in-depth look at the importance of understanding the lyrics to songs. Bemoaning the decline of printed lyric booklets in CD cases and the rise of standalone MP3 downloads, she argues that whether or not we get the words wrong, and whether or not we like the music, the intended meaning behind the lyrics (and more importantly what it means to us) is something which we shouldn&#8217;t lose. I completely concur. The emotional and poetic connection we make with a song and its meaning is something that would, to our detriment, be lost if the decline of the printed lyric continues.</p>

However, human-made noise is increasingly disrupting this harmony and intrudes on a piece of the spectrum already in use - drowning out natures voice &#8230; Something similar is happening with the explosive adoption of social media tools and the information they generate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Keith Brophy writes an insightful post which looks at humans&#8217; ecological impact, and relates it to the information overload people increasingly suffer as a result of the explosion in social networking. Absolutely fascinating, well written stuff.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don Reisinger quite rightly asks why Apple is allowing developers to sell useless iPhone applications on the App Store for ridiculous prices, citing one priced at almost $1000. As he says, allowing developers the independence to set prices without interference is, in general, a very good thing. However, when it stops being simple commercial ambition and instead becomes &#8220;app spam&#8221; and blatant profiteering with the intention of suckering users, they should step in and stop it - even if just by putting a sensible cap on prices.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I&#8217;m not at all a fan of the article&#8217;s tone or his sweeping and unfair generalisations, Mark Valladares makes a good point in his recent post about a Guardian article. In it, the newspaper claimed that one in five paternity claims made to the Child Support Agency were incorrect. However, this is a gross misrepresentation. The real conclusion is that 20% of all DNA tests were negative - but given that 80% of claims go uncontested, this figure actually only represents 4% of all support claims made to the CSA. It&#8217;s disappointing that a newspaper of The Guardian&#8217;s calibre will twist figures for a headline.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;As I’ve argued in the past, Yahoo needs to out-open Google if it is going to have any chance at competing in search. Even if it’s too late to catch up to Google in core search, an open approach could help Yahoo differentiate its product, win over developers, and open up new avenues of search that Google is currently ignoring. And being open means embracing Google as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a really interesting idea from Erick Schonfeld. Given Google&#8217;s dominance, he&#8217;s right that a change of tack is needed to come anywhere near making inroads in search - and it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that on the Web, the more open a technology and its <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>s, the more widely adopted it becomes.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea of using a combination of <acronym title="Peer To Peer">P2P</acronym> technology and idle processing power is nothing new when it comes to networks of PCs. However, European and Australian researchers have come up with the innovative idea of using television set-top boxes as nodes instead. More numerous in many homes than computers and always-on, the concept which could potentially increase network sizes drastically. The resulting P2P cloud could, the article reports, be used for anything from creating a vast Flickr-like service to providing decentralised networks of on-demand content.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a terrible irony unfolding in Bosnia. Radovan Karadzic is at last on his way to the Hague. But the division of Bosnia that was his dream is now more likely than at any time since he became a fugitive &#8230; But now this is happening not because of aggression from outside, but because of weariness and misjudgment of the international community which is still supposed to be guiding Bosnia to its future.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Paddy Ashdown warns that Bosnia is again teetering on the edge of division - and potential conflict as a result. Article in The Guardian, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/27/serbia.balkans">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Israel&#8217;s secret police are pressuring Palestinians in Gaza to spy on their community in exchange for urgent medical treatment, according to a report released today by an Israeli human rights organisation &#8230; International law forbids the use of civilians in conflict to damage an enemy state and collaboration in the Palestinian community is a crime punishable by death.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet again, Israel demonstrates a disgusting disregard for human life. Physicians for Human Rights report that Shin Bet have been forcing Palestinians to choose between informing on friends and family, or be barred treatment for life-threatening medical conditions. Unsurprising given Israel&#8217;s track record, but absolutely sickening nonetheless.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington Post recently reported on the shocking prevalence of HIV amongst black people in the US, with two percent of African-Americans infected. This percentage, worse than many developing nations, yet again demonstrates the terrible divide between different racial and socioeconomic groups in the US. Even worse is that this study came out a couple of days before another, which concluded that HIV prevalence in the US as a whole is - and has always been - far higher than previously thought. So if one in fifty infected isn&#8217;t shocking enough, the real number may actually be greater.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7539625.stm">The BBC reports</a> on the Environmental Audit Committee&#8217;s scepticism over plans to increase road tax for more polluting vehicles bought since 2001. However, the government report doesn&#8217;t go far enough in condemning the plan. Despite their conclusions, it&#8217;s a retrospective tax which penalises drivers who have previously bought more polluting cars, rather than aiming to change future behaviour. The increase will hit the poorest hardest, as they are less able to replace their cars with more fuel efficient models. And enticing people to scrap their current cars in favour of more efficient models is not an environmentally friendly way to proceed anyway, as the environmental impact of scrapping a car and building a completely new one is surely far worse than using an existing, more polluting car until the end of its natural life. The plans are ill thought-out and smack of the desperation of a government wanting to demonstrate any kind of direction as it flounders.</p>

<p>The BBC reports on a Microsoft study, which asks whether the &#8220;six degrees of separation&#8221; theory holds true on their Messenger IM network.
