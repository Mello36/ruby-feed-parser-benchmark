				<title>Coldplay Sued by Joe Satriani and Why I Love Music Copyright Lawsuits.</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>If you haven't seen it yet, Coldplay <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jI-M_yr36FvwE1Mv7SDJiLqaJ0GA">has been sued by Joe Satriani</a> over Cold Play's hit song <em>Viva La Vida</em>.&#160; Joe is claiming that his song was ripped off.&#160; I think the following video best explains the lawsuit.&#160; </p>  <p></p> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1ofFw9DKu_I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" />   <p></p>  <p>It's really uncanny how similar the songs are.&#160; They are even the same key.&#160; But is it copyright infringement?&#160; I love lawsuits like these because there are such interesting issues at play.&#160; My former law school professor <a href="http://www.bodmanllp.com/attorneys/susan_m_kornfield_partner.html">Susan Kornfield</a> is to thank for creating all of my interest in this subject.</p>  <p>The key here is that Joe must prove Coldplay <em>ACTUALLY</em> copied his work.&#160; George Harrison was <a href="http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm">found guilty of plagiarizing</a> &quot;He's so Fine&quot; when he released &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; when the court found that he <em>subconsciously</em> copied the song.&#160; He's so Fine was a big enough hit that it was hard for George to argue that he had never heard the song and although he contended there was no intent, the court said that subconscious infringement was still infringement.&#160; </p>  <p>Let's assume for a moment that Coldplay did not intentionally steal Joe's song.&#160; (And if they did, they were idiots - couldn't you guys at least change the key?).</p>  <p>The question is did they have access to hear Joe's original work?&#160; Joe's song certainly never got any airplay.&#160; Even my rock and roll guitar partner <a href="http://www.ryanmcintyre.com">Ryan</a> had never heard of it.&#160; This will be very interesting to see how it plays out.&#160; The chord structure is nothing novel, it's really all about the melody.</p>  <p>If you like interesting cases like this, make sure to check out John Fogerty being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fogerty_v._Fantasy">sued for allegedly copying himself</a> and Ray Parker Jr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(song)">having to pay Huey Lewis for Ghostbusters</a>.</p>]]></description>

				<title>Cool Patent Startup Pays People To Discover Prior Art</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.articleonepartners.com/welcome.php" target="_blank">Article One Partners</a> has recently launched and it looks like a winner.&#160; In short, they are paying people to research and discover prior art related to <a href="http://www.articleonepartners.com/featured.php" target="_blank">patent studies</a> they find interesting.&#160; There first three related to the drug Lipitor, Semiconductor memory devices and my favorite, video game patents.</p>  <p>They are offering up to $50,000 bounties for the discovery of new prior art.&#160; I think initiatives like these will only increase the transparency in patents and decrease some of the worthless patent litigation in this country.&#160; </p>]]></description>

				<title><![CDATA[The &quot;Other Pine Street&quot; in Boulder County]]></title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="http://www.ryanmcintyre.com">Ryan</a> and I moved to Boulder a little over 2.5 years ago, we both bought homes on Pine street in downtown Boulder (random, not planned).&#160; To our dismay, the online mapping services didn't know where we lived, despite our homes being built over 100 years ago.&#160; Ryan <a href="http://www.ryanmcintyre.com/blog/archives/2006/06/eight-blocks-of.php">blogged about it at the time</a>.&#160; It really sucked as every delivery person, cable dude, etc. ended up at the wrong Pine street in Boulder county.</p>  <p>Today, I decided to take a car trip and check out some of the wonderful mountainous terrain around Boulder and on the way home stopped by the &quot;other&quot; Pine street.&#160; Clearly this Pine street is much different than downtown Boulder.&#160; It was nice to see what all the delivery folks got to see.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TheOtherPineStreetinBoulderCounty_11880/DSC00107.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="DSC00107" src="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TheOtherPineStreetinBoulderCounty_11880/DSC00107_thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TheOtherPineStreetinBoulderCounty_11880/DSC00110.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="DSC00110" src="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TheOtherPineStreetinBoulderCounty_11880/DSC00110_thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TheOtherPineStreetinBoulderCounty_11880/DSC00111.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="DSC00111" src="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TheOtherPineStreetinBoulderCounty_11880/DSC00111_thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0" /></a></p>]]></description>

				<title>Oblong - It's Alive, Doctor, It's Alive</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>Some of you have heard me talk about <a href="http://www.oblong.com/" target="_blank">Oblong</a>.&#160; It's a spatial operating environment that I believe will change the way people interact with computers.&#160; And it's just damn cool.&#160; You should definitely check out the video on the home page.</p>  <p>Think of Oblong as the science fact version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" target="_blank">Minority Report</a>.&#160; In fact, the movie's science and technology advisor is the founder of Oblong.&#160; This first time that I used my hands to interact with a computer was the one of the most stunning experiences that I've had in my venture capital career.&#160; It was one of those &quot;I've seen the future&quot; moments, but in the present.&#160; </p>  <p>Oblong is part of our <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/03/theme-human-computer-interacti.php" target="_blank">Human Computer Interface investment theme</a> and we are very excited about the company.

				<title>Healthy Ways to Tighten the Corporate Belt</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>My friend <a href="http://web.mac.com/hartmanhrlaw/Site/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Amy Hartman</a>, who recently started her own law firm specializing in employment matters wrote a great piece called &quot;<a href="http://web.mac.com/hartmanhrlaw/Site/Articles.html" target="_blank">Feel the Burn</a>.&quot;</p>  <p>It's a very informative, yet easy to read piece on strategies for cutting your company's burn rate during these challenging times.</p>  <p>Most of her advice is with her employment law hat on, which is certainly a chief concern when contemplating cost reductions.</p>]]></description>

				<title>A Patent Even I Can Support</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>My friend <a href="http://www.neugeborenlaw.com/" target="_blank">Craig Neugeboren</a> sent me this <a href="http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2008/11/junk-patents.html" target="_blank">link</a> today on an interesting patent.&#160; It's essentially a patent for non-inventors acquiring and asserting patents against others.&#160; Think of this as patenting the idea of patent trolling.&#160; :)</p>  <p>The <em><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/10/30/court-reverses-position-on-business-methods-patents-in-bilski-case/?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank">Bilski</a></em> court may have something to say about this, but it's still entertaining.&#160; </p>]]></description>

				<title>The Sky Is Falling.  It's All Over.  Oh Yeah, and Lawyers Want to Profit From It.</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>If you are a regular reader of the this blog, you know that <a href="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/archives/2008/10/how-does-the-ma.php.php">I don't ascribe</a> to much of the doom and gloom that everyone wants to wallow in.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>This isn't to say that I have my head in the sand.&#160; I realize that many people are losing their jobs and that <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2008/10/round_two_of_th.html">companies need to run their businesses extra efficiently</a>, but this isn't exactly &quot;R.I.P&quot; for the good times, despite anything <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/10/10/the-sequoia-rip-good-times-presentation-get-your-copy-here/">other venture firms may say</a>.&#160; The sky is not falling and it's not &quot;game over.&quot;&#160; The economy will bounce back.&#160; </p>  <p>Also, if you are a regular reader, it's possible that you've picked up <a href="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/archives/2008/06/why-startup-law.php.php">my issues with many law firms' billing practices</a>. </p>  <p>What do these two topics have in common?&#160; Where there's a crises, there is always a lawyer willing to make some money on it.&#160; Today's candidate:&#160; <a href="http://www.proskauer.com/index.html">Proskauer Rose</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>I just read that Proskauer has created an &quot;<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/proskauer-rose-creates-economic-crisis/story.aspx?guid=%7BA917530F-D378-4F5C-A4F3-D6CE88E5EC83%7D&amp;dist=hppr">Economic Crisis Response Group</a>&quot; to deal with the uncertainty we face.&#160; I'm not sure who in the marketing department came up with this, but I about fell off my chair laughing. </p>  <p>According to the press release, the group:</p>  <p>- Includes lawyers from different practice groups;</p>  <p>- Who quickly respond to clients affected by the current turmoil; and </p>  <p>- Who monitor, analyze and disseminate information on new developments as they arise.</p>  <p>Uh, isn't this what <em><strong>ALL </strong></em>law firms do?&#160; In fact, if you weren't doing this before, what exactly where you doing?&#160; I'm sure that with all specialty groups, they've found a way to bump up their hourly rates for this elite group, but maybe this is just marketing gone really wrong.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Do they get to wear cool super hero uniforms?&#160; If so, I'm down with that.&#160; </p>  <p>Sigh, just more noise being added to the system.&#160; Not exactly what we need right now. </p>]]></description>

				<title>East Coast Restaurant Reviews - Troquet and Sushi Yasuda</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since I've posted about any recent dining experiences, but being on the east coast this week, I thought I'd give a couple of quick shout outs.&#160; (Can one use the term &quot;shout out&quot; when referring to fine dining?&#160; I'm going to try).</p>  <p><a href="http://www.troquetboston.com/index.html">Troquet</a> (Boston) - Troquet is quaint and cute little wine bar and restaurant that serves up French-inspired cuisine with a lighter touch than most.&#160; The upstairs dining room overlooking Boyston street was a very comfortable room.&#160; The little bar in the front is right out of movie and I was fortunate to meet a fellow <a href="http://www.umich.edu">Michigan Wolverine</a> fan whose fiance is the pastry chef at the restaurant.&#160; We tried the wild boar, halibut and salmon and each dish was very well done.&#160; (For those of you who know me, I was good and kept to the salmon despite my boar proclivities).&#160; The wine list was well priced and varied and my only issue was that all wines were paired to particular menu items - it wasn't just a list.&#160; I suppose that's helpful to some and I felt a little silly getting a barbera with my salmon, but such is life.&#160; We didn't leave room for dessert.&#160; All in all, a really solid and comfy place.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.sushiyasuda.com/home.html">Sushi Yasuda</a> (New York) - Wow.&#160; I've been to a lot of sushi places and consider myself somewhat of a sushi snob, but like... wow.&#160; This isn't <a href="http://www.noburestaurants.com/">Nobu</a>, or even a <a href="http://sushisasadenver.com/">Sushi Sasa</a> (for those of you in Denver) that breaks any creative boundaries - this is all about the fish.&#160; Four different toros, arctic char, three types of unagis, five types of mackerels, three shrimps, etc.&#160; This is about fish on rice.&#160; This is about simple rolls.&#160; We just had the waitress bring us whatever the chef wanted to serve and after eating way more than two people should, we doubled down and said &quot;bring more.&quot;&#160; We could have kept going, but at some point, you know that you should just stop.&#160; This was some of the most interesting and wonderful fish that I've ever had.&#160; Bravo.&#160; Don't go there if you are looking for low lighting and great ambiance, but if you are there to eat some of the best product ever, you will be happy.</p>  <p>I'm full.&#160; </p>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Alright, it is a bit melodramatic, but this is funny stuff.&#160; My friend <a href="http://www.lowenstein.com/sreed/">Sarah Reed</a> of Lowenstein Sandler PC. has a sardonic sense of humor and guest posted on Brad's blog about the <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2008/10/legal_lexicon_f.html">ABC's of everything falling apart</a>.&#160; Sick, but very, very funny.&#160; Two of my favorites are letters N and P.&#160; Here's a teaser:</p>  <p><b>N </b>is for<b> No: </b>brace yourself for that response if you are looking for money &#8211; from LPs, from VCs, from customers, from venture debt lenders. Start thinking of creative ways of explaining why are different (cloud computing, on-demand services, disciplined deployment of capital, blah blah blah). <b></b></p>  <p><b>P</b> is for <b>Peace with Honor</b>: it&#8217;s what you get when you sell the company for just enough so that all creditors are paid and the VCs get back some fraction of their money. Declare victory, go home.</p>]]></description>

				<title>Sign Of Southwest Airlines Losing Its Mojo?</title>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>I've always been a huge fan of <a href="http://www.southwest.com/">Southwest Airlines</a>.&#160; Whether it was how they battled American Airline's predatory pricing tactics in their early days to former CEO Herb Kelleher <a href="http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/airborne.html">arm wrestling for the right to use a tag line</a>, I've always found Southwest to be different than all other airlines.&#160; They are what they are and they are usually on time.&#160; And more often than not, their employees are friendly and highly competent.&#160; </p>  <p>They've also done a great job weathering many economic storms.&#160; They are by far the most consistently profitable airline in our country.&#160; Some of this was based on the fact they locked up long term gas contracts (although I've heard these are no longer in operation), as well as flying only one type of aircraft.&#160; And a lot of it is that they just seem to run more efficiently and less stupidly than the other airlines.&#160; (Are you listening United?)</p>  <p>That being said, today was a ominous sign.&#160; On the way to LAX from DEN, <a href="http://www.feld.com">Brad</a> and I were 2 of 15 people on the entire plane.&#160; I really like flying empty planes and it was the most mellow flight that I've had in a long, long time, but not a good sign for my favorite carrier.&#160; See the follow picture which I took from row 7 just after pulling to the gate.&#160; These were all the people sitting behind me on the flight.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/SignOfSouthwestAirlinesLosingItsMojo_ECF3/photo_2.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="346" alt="photo" src="http://www.jasonmendelson.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/SignOfSouthwestAirlinesLosingItsMojo_ECF3/photo_thumb.jpg" width="260" border="0" /></a></p>]]></description>
