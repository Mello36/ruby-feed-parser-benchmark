        <content type="html">&lt;P&gt;
Wikipedia is one of the world&apos;s most visited web sites (8th in the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=global&amp;lang=none&quot;&gt;top 10&lt;/A&gt;, in fact), delivering an enormous breadth of content to an audience as vast as the internet.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 110px;&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/meta/2/2a/Nohat-logo-nowords-bgwhite-200px.jpg
&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

But Wikipedia&apos;s evolved to become more than an on-line encyclopedia: they&apos;ve become one of the world&apos;s largest search engines, they&apos;re a global source of real-time news, alongisde educational, political and health related content - and one of the world&apos;s most valuable brands and media properties.
&lt;P&gt;
Wikipedia&apos;s also a great example of a &quot;&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/Gregp/entry/a_word_or_two_on&quot;&gt;redshift&lt;/A&gt;&quot; application: a segment of the market that&apos;s growing faster than the technology industry&apos;s capacity to innovate. Technology companies have to pay special attention to such &lt;em&gt;redshifted&lt;/em&gt; segments - not only do they eventually grow the overall market, but their innovation often drives the technology landscape. Broadly speaking, social media, from free news and social networking, to search and content sharing, is doing exactly that - defining new architectures and requirements for radical scale, economics and availability.
&lt;P&gt;
So I was really pleased that  &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/081120/20081120005365.html?.v=1&quot;&gt;Wikimedia had chosen Sun&apos;s Open Storage platforms&lt;/a&gt; over proprietary alternatives, to help manage their evolution to rich media - bringing high quality video and time based content to their more than 250,000,000 users globally. That&apos;s a big audience waiting to upload - and interact with - high quality content.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 80px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
Like Wikipedia, most of the planet&apos;s largest web sites (just look at the top 100) are built atop Sun&apos;s MySQL database. Which is why we&apos;ve just introduced a line of systems platform designed specifically to run MySQL - at up to 3x the performance of whitebox alternatives (after all, it&apos;s far easier marketing to audiences that have already chosen Sun). We&apos;re now expanding those offerings with our newest &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storagetek/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Open Storage&lt;/A&gt; portfolio, as well - built to run ZFS from 5 to &lt;b&gt;50x&lt;/b&gt; traditional performance. And again, all such systems are available &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/systems/solutions/mysql/performance.jsp&quot;&gt;here for free trial&lt;/a&gt; - pick the system you want to try, we&apos;ll cover shipping costs to and from your site.
&lt;P&gt;
And while I&apos;m on the topic of systems... I&apos;ve been asked for insights into our recent software reorganization, in which we announced three main focus groups (a Systems group, an Applications group, and a Cloud group). Why&apos;d we make that change?
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_World_Financial_Center&quot;&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 340px;&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/SWFC_July_2007.jpg/212px-SWFC_July_2007.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/A&gt;

First, look no further than this win for one of my main motivations: I&apos;d like to enhance the value and alignment we offer to customers that want to run our system software (like MySQL and ZFS) at very high scale - and require, from Sun and our OEM partners, the tightest possible technical collaboration and alignment between hardware and software.
&lt;P&gt;
Second, this move amplifies the obvious (at least to us): the storage market will be larger than the server market, but you may not be able to tell - they&apos;re converging, built from the same systems software and hardware components (networking will follow the same path, more on that in the future). 
&lt;P&gt;
Finally, adoption and software distribution/marketing is different than revenue generation. And with the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://sysnet.sunwarp.net/maps/?lat=26.745610382199022&amp;lng=-10.8984375&amp;zoom=2&amp;mtype=Blank&quot;&gt;adoption of ZFS&lt;/A&gt; well underway, technical and business alignment have become our dominant priorities. It&apos;s at the heart of what&apos;s fueling one of Sun&apos;s fastest growing businesses (ZFS based Open Storage was up &lt;em&gt;more than 150%&lt;/em&gt; last quarter, growing far faster than our proprietary peers). 
&lt;P&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 



How large is the redshift opportunity? It&apos;s not just businesses like Wikipedia that are defining new scale requirements for the industry. It&apos;s the on-line bank I saw last week, now serving more than 100m accounts globally - contemplating the addition of video chat for customer service. It&apos;s the government customer I just visited trying to deliver driver&apos;s license and passport renewal services to hundreds of millions of its citizens. The term redshift describes applications, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; customers (remember, even Wikipedia has payroll - not exactly a redshift application).
&lt;P&gt;
In an openly networked world, redshift applications begin to equate to social phenomena - and social phenomena don&apos;t respect your IT budget. Which is to say, neither a 10 person startup, nor a 10,000 person retailer want to go broke buying software licenses and storage, just because they&apos;ve struck a chord with the planet. Which is increasingly why both sides of the industry are moving to open source. 
&lt;P&gt;
And open storage.
&lt;P&gt;

        <content type="html">As consumer spending slows across the world, a variety of &quot;brick and mortar&quot; retailers are clearly feeling the impact. Foot traffic is slowing, and it&apos;s getting harder to balance debt laden real estate portfolios and fickle consumer trends.

&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zappos.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 110px;&quot; src=&quot;http://z.about.com/d/shoes/1/0/u/K/converse_sneakers.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;P&gt;

For consumer product manufacturers, retail distribution is key - it&apos;s how you get in front of a customer. It&apos;s why the big PC manufacturers are all working hard to score deals with big retailers (or build their own retail outlets) around the world. 

&lt;P&gt;

But making money on PC&apos;s is tough - for most PC makers, you&apos;re remarketing someone else&apos;s operating system and someone else&apos;s microprocessor - it&apos;s not for the faint of heart (or faint of balance sheet). For Sun, our retail distribution concerns don&apos;t surround consumer hardware (we don&apos;t make PC&apos;s) as much as consumer &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; - the popularity of which defines our market opportunity. Said simply, if you&apos;re running Java or another open source platform, Sun can build differentiated datacenters in the clouds behind those devices. If not, it&apos;s a lot tougher (not impossible, just a lot tougher).

&lt;object width=&quot;213&quot; height=&quot;172&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/8To-6VIJZRE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/8To-6VIJZRE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;213&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; align=right style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 20px 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Consumer software, though, is defined by a virtuous cycle. Developers target popular software (like Firefox, Flash or Java). In so doing, they create applications and content that consumers use. What consumers use, they tend to use in volume (the internet&apos;s a very big place, after all). Developers notice those volumes, and target the platforms that reach the most consumers. And that defines Sun&apos;s market opportunity (someone smart once jumped up and down on stage yelling &quot;Developers! Developers! Developers!&quot; Amen.)
&lt;p&gt;
The Java runtime remains one of the world&apos;s most popular platforms used by developers - and thus, one of the world&apos;s most popular consumer software products. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 100px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Unknown.jpeg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
For the cynics about to chime in with &quot;but I don&apos;t use it,&quot; the odds are good you do - it&apos;s become an invisible, but critical part of an enormous breadth of consumer and business services (from video uploaders on social networks, to stock market analytical tools). And as that content becomes more popular, so does the Java platform - expanding Sun&apos;s market opportunity in the corresponding datacenters. That&apos;s why we see it as a virtuous cycle.
&lt;P&gt;
That cycle also provides Sun with some exceptional foot traffic - just last month, we distributed more than 60,000,000 Java runtimes, to users all across the planet. The number is growing, as more content is built for Java 6 and the upcoming &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://java.sun.com/javafx/&quot;&gt;JavaFX&lt;/A&gt;, as more PC&apos;s join the network, and as more workers join the workforce (and are assigned Java-enabled laptops). At this point, I&apos;d bet there are about 1,000,000,000 (that&apos;s a billion) Java runtimes installed on PC&apos;s around the world. With more by the day - each generating revenue for Sun. 
&lt;P&gt;
As with most of our software products, we don&apos;t distribute products without intent - like Google, our products are both a means of acquiring customers, and generating revenue. Freely distributed software establishes a relationship with an end user - just like free search, free news or free shopping. About two years ago, we reached an agreement with Google in which they recognized the value of our relationships with Java consumers. Just as the PC makers want distribution via retail outlets, Google wanted distribution of their search technologies - via our Java update mechanism. When we present an update to a user, we may offer other sponsored software (a Google search toolbar, eg).

&lt;P&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 110px;&quot; src=&quot;http://cocktailnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/gavel_auction.gif&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

After a careful negotiation, we agreed, and crafted a wonderful relationship that served consumers, Google, and Sun. Last year, we renewed the agreement, and recognized even more value for all involved. This year, we decided to run an open auction, and received bids from a number of companies. It was a tough process, but given the growing volume and momentum around Java, we clearly represented just about the most popular distribution vehicle on the internet today - and Microsoft worked hard to represent the most attractive total offer.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 15px 10px 0px; cursor:pointer; width: 80px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

The decision to go with Microsoft was based on overall value - it was also predicated upon their endorsement of and agreement to help promote MySQL. Stay tuned for more details on what we&apos;ll be doing together.
&lt;P&gt;
What&apos;s the deal worth to Sun? This deal will be one of the most valuable distribution deals ever struck in the industry - and it likely makes Microsoft one of Sun&apos;s largest customers. It&apos;ll also set the stage for an even more interesting auction next year, as more and more folks realize the value of retail distribution. Thus far, our deal with Microsoft is US only - and new auctions are in flight for international rights (alongside other non-toolbar products for the US, perhaps a browser...).
&lt;P&gt;
As for other high value distribution assets at Sun? I just read one analyst report questioning whether anyone actually used OpenOffice. We happen to run Sun Microsystems on OpenOffice - more importantly, it&apos;s used across the world, and we&apos;re now commercially licensing it to brand name companies wanting to save big dollars on office productivity. 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px; cursor:pointer; width: 180px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://marketing.openoffice.org/art/galleries/marketing/web_buttons/nicu/180x60_1_free.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;



To put some data around its popularity, last week, we distributed more than &lt;b&gt;3,000,000&lt;/b&gt; copies of OpenOffice 3. Downloads are accelerating, giving us a reachable user base we estimate to be between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 users - a global recession will amplify OpenOffice adoption. And 100&apos;s of millions of users drive a lot of foot traffic. An auction&apos;s afoot (no pun intended) to see who we&apos;ll be partnering with us to integrate their businesses and brands into our binary product distribution - the possibilities are limitless: people tend to print those documents, fax them, copy them, project them &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(and I know this annoys my friends in the free software community, but branding allows us to invest more in OO.o community and features, from which everyone benefits)&lt;/font&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.verizon.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px; cursor:pointer; width: 40px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/techchron/2008/10/08/BB_Storm_Front_Left271x500.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

With Verizon running a &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/verizon-microsoft-near-web-search-deal/story.aspx?guid={42E3D81E-3E33-44D9-BBE6-56157EC0850A}&quot;&gt;similar auction&lt;/A&gt; to integrate a search vendor into their wireless devices, they (and their industry across the world) are seeing the same opportunity. Just because a few retailers are having trouble doesn&apos;t mean the value of reaching customers has gone away. Foot traffic still counts, but in today&apos;s economy, software distribution&apos;s a lot easier to manage and monetize than a real estate portfolio. 
&lt;P&gt;
After all, who wouldn&apos;t want to meet a few hundred million new customers?
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; I should&apos;ve clarified, above: users without any interest in toolbars can simply decline the offer during install - and receive their Java update without any sponsored software.

The bursting of the internet bubble was good for the computer industry.
&lt;P&gt;
Many of us didn&apos;t like the medicine, but I can&apos;t remember a single customer upset at the idea of paying $20,000 for computing infrastructure that used to cost them $100,000. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/2464554/Beluga-whales-blowing-bubble-rings.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 110px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00782/beluga-whale-bubble_782214i.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; The price compression came from open source software, and a move toward general purpose servers, and resulted in companies formerly making 65% gross profit on products (Sun among them) facing a new reality.
&lt;P&gt;
But what doesn&apos;t kill you makes you stronger.
&lt;P&gt;
Since then, Sun&apos;s built the biggest open source software business around (see &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/LineItems.pdf&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/A&gt; for details), from platform software to application infrastructure (even a &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp&quot;&gt;consumer product&lt;/A&gt; or two). Like Google and Microsoft, our products are both our ads and our revenue streams - our brands, and products, are recognized globally.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1683878780?bclid=1683701916&amp;bctid=1900390530&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 140px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQLSystems.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

On Monday last week, you saw us continue to convert that brand awareness to revenue - with the introduction of a full line of &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/systems/solutions/mysql/solutions.jsp&quot;&gt;MySQL optimized systems&lt;/A&gt;. By our estimates, there are about 11,000,000 MySQL users on earth - our new systems can &lt;em&gt;triple&lt;/em&gt; their application performance. So we&apos;ve made free evaluation units available to MySQL users (via our &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/systems/solutions/mysql/performance.jsp&quot;&gt;Try and Buy&lt;/A&gt; programs)&lt;/b&gt;. Click the image to the right to listen to Marten Mickos and John Fowler talk about the opportunities ahead.
&lt;P&gt;
And that brings me to today. I was on a call last week with the Global CIO for one of our largest customers - one who was dramatically affected by the credit crisis. I was outlining where we were headed in open storage (a business that grew more than 150% for Sun last quarter), and he said, &quot;One of your peers just told me flash was overhyped.&quot; I asked him if the peer happened to work for a proprietary storage company. He protected his source, but I knew the answer (I probably knew the CEO, too).
&lt;p&gt;
The storage industry bears a remarkable resemblance to the proprietary server industry at the bursting of the 

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.bctree.com/images/photos/summer-plum.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

internet bubble - closed, highly profitable, frustrating customers with exorbitant charges. Plump, and ripe for change. Like a plum. Flash memory and open source file systems are about to change the landscape, and upend the industry - you read it here, first.

&lt;P&gt;
A &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm&quot;&gt;notable philosopher&lt;/A&gt; once said, &quot;You have to stop to change direction&quot; - and for better or worse, I know a lot of customers stopping right now. They&apos;re rethinking their future, and it&apos;s into that thought process we&apos;re introducing our newest open storage platforms, engineered with flash memory and open software to radically scale back what customers have to spend - while radically increasing performance, capability and ease of use.

Amplifying our Thumper product line, what started as the FISHWorks Project (&lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;ully &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;ntegrated &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;oftware and &lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;ardware) in Sun&apos;s Labs, is now being unveiled - in the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Sun Storage 7000&lt;/a&gt; line of unified storage products.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, storing data on a disk is fairly straightforward. But administering large pools of fully replicated data, diagnosing problems on production systems, seamlessly dealing with capacity planning and disk failures, spanning every protocol known to man - all without draining your budget with antediluvian license keys and proprietary hardware - those are very high value problems to solve.
&lt;p&gt;
And those are exactly the problems we&apos;ve solved.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/images/g20_abr_feature1_zoom.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 100px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/images/g20_abr_feature1_zoom.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 

The 7000 class systems take about five minutes to set up and provision (yes, five), and we&apos;ve eliminated almost all the complexity around volume administration and drive failure (remember, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/zfs_learning_center.jsp&quot;&gt;ZFS technology&lt;/A&gt; is at the core). The 7000 systems are driven by the most scalable, powerful, open storage microcode in the industry: the OpenSolaris kernel. DTrace analytics provide a real-time lens into &lt;em&gt;production systems&lt;/em&gt; - to understand performance, workloads, and help make live capacity-planning decisions (click picture at left for a sample control panel). The systems come bundled with a full suite of protocol, data management and availability features - built into the system without incremental fees or license keys. 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 80px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

For the geeks among you, we&apos;ve turbocharged ZFS with &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/x64/intel/zfs_solution_brief.pdf&quot;&gt;Hybrid Storage Pools&lt;/A&gt;. Hybrid storage pools allow ZFS to optimize storage performance by spreading data out across DRAM, read or write optimized flash memory (they&apos;re not the same thing, after all), and very lower power commodity disks. The net result is a massive speedup in storage performance, with an equivalently massive drop in power consumption, all managed transparently - applications will just run faster. Much, much faster. For a full set of technical videos/specs, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/tips.jsp&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
Storage customers and administrators are about to experience a radical improvement to their quality of life - all without pharmaceutical intervention. And as the price of flash memory continues to plummet, it&apos;s only going to get better.
&lt;p&gt;
But you have to stop to change direction.
&lt;P&gt;

On behalf of Sun Microsystems, I would like to offer my sincerest congratulations to President elect Barack Obama. What an extraordinary accomplishment.
&lt;P&gt;
I would also like to extend my congratulations to his web team for having chosen MySQL as the platform behind their election web site, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/techinterest&quot;&gt;BarackObama.com&lt;/A&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;
Lest many of you get your hopes up, we cannot guarantee the White House to all MySQL users.

        <content type="html">We announced our earnings today, and put specifics around our preannouncement from a week ago. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.netbanker.com/Images/glass6.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

We also greatly increased the transparency of Sun&apos;s business by providing line item detail surrounding our most important product categories (and we broke out core elements of our Software business for the first time). If you&apos;d like to listen to our earnings call, just &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/investor/earnings_releases/audiocast.html&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt; - in addition, here&apos;s a quick synopsis of the quarter and our business overall.
&lt;P&gt;
At a corporate level in Q1, Sun&apos;s revenue was down 7% year over year. Growth in our emerging products was more than offset by declines in our traditional, high end products. We were surprised by the magnitude of the decline, which reflected a dramatic slowing in the US and Europe, and the effects the credit crisis is having on our customers - across nearly all geographies and industries, but clearly concentrated among financial services companies.
&lt;P&gt;
Unlike our peers, Sun is more exposed to high end systems - so declines in this business have an immediate impact, even if our newer, emerging businesses demonstrate fantastic growth (which many did). For example, the Tape market won&apos;t sustain 30% year over year growth for any participant - but our ZFS based OpenStorage products are growing at more than 100%. The latter are smaller, emerging businesses, driven by open source and new innovations - and will take time to eclipse more traditional businesses in our P&amp;L.
&lt;P&gt;
To drive an even greater level of transparency for investors and analysts, we&apos;ve added a new management report to our quarterly updates - for the first time, this will give line item detail of our performance, and a sense for how we&apos;re making some of the most important decisions at the core of our long term strategy. You can find that break out, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/LineItems.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
Here are a few of the major questions I&apos;m receiving:
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What went well within the quarter?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
The biggest highlights were the performance of our Solaris based, chip multi-threading (CMT) systems, which again grew a whopping 80%, year over year. These systems leverage awareness of Solaris/Opensolaris and our outstanding ISV portfolio, and are driven by extreme energy efficiency and virtualization - attributes we just multiplied with the launch of our newest CMT system: the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t5440/&quot;&gt;T5440&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
Simultaneously, our Open Storage systems also delivered a great quarter, up 150+% year over year. These systems, known by many as Thumpers, are amplified by the awareness of our open source ZFS file system, a technology at the heart of Sun&apos;s storage business. You&apos;ll be hearing more about Open Storage at a launch event we&apos;re holding on November 10th. If you&apos;re technical, and you want some hints about what we&apos;re about to unveil, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/storage/entry/flash_performance_in_storage_systems&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;
And finally, most of our software business grew - including MySQL, Java, alongside Solaris, management and our virtualization products. As we&apos;ve been saying, open source is a great distribution model - and it feeds a great revenue model.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What about lowlights?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Clearly the traditional businesses slowed significantly - with enterprise systems (our largest, mainframe class systems) declining year over year. This time last year, those same systems grew nearly 20% - so the downturn is having an impact. It&apos;s crucial to understand these systems are far less sensitive to open source innovations or Solaris adoption - they&apos;re sold to customers who are scaling up existing Solaris applications, who rely on quality, fault tolerance and our capacity to deliver mainframe scale. We and Fujitsu just expanded this product line - and no matter the downturn, we remain exceptionally focused and committed to traditional enterprise computing. The expansion of scale out computing doesn&apos;t negate scale up computing - if anything, it leads to even greater demand, over time. IBM was right, mainframes will always be sexy (especially when they run Solaris :). 
&lt;P&gt;
On the storage front, tape declined slightly, although our high end storage systems grew, yielding growth overall in storage - growth we&apos;re driving to accelerate with the introduction of our upcoming Open Storage innovations.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why were gross margins lower this quarter?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
A few reasons that Mike Lehman, our CFO, elaborated on during the call - the lull in very high end systems, along with discounting and component pricing depressed gross margins. In addition, we went through a series of product transition related expenses this quarter we do not expect to recur, that depressed margins by around 2 percentage points.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Now, how is Software growing if you give everything away?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
We make our software freely available to enable its distribution to the farthest reaches of the market - which we then monetize with commercial subscriptions and services, alongside optimized hardware systems (like Open Storage, above). We continue to reach customers that have already settled on our software - the process of selling to them is simplified by the fact they&apos;re already using our core products. And unlike most university students (who typically have more time than money), our paying customers view downtime or administrative complexity as more expensive than a software subscription (that is, they have more money than time). 
&lt;P&gt;
Thus, customers will pay, and continue to pay for access to enterprise grade features, along with mission critical support and maintenance - the Software business is both a license, subscription and services business. 
&lt;P&gt;
To understand the total size and value of Software at Sun, you need to look at billings alongside our multi billion dollar support streams - remembering that a lot of our software is sold as a subscription service (remember, it&apos;s open source). In addition, you have to recognize that how much a &quot;Systems Service&quot; support contract is attributable to software is entirely subjective (we don&apos;t price them separately to customers). It&apos;s like asking how much revenue a mobile phone manufacturer should attribute to their operating system - you&apos;re not charged separately at the point of sale.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wait, you make money off Java?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Yes, it&apos;s among the most profitable technology products at Sun - and improving. Java&apos;s one of the most popularly distributed pieces of Software on the internet, we distribute over a million Java runtimes a day to users across every OS and geography on PC&apos;s. That helps us reach a very broad community of users and, more importantly, developers. We have some exciting news coming up around these distribution volumes - and their value to us, and others.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is Sun focusing on?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Strategically, we continue to focus on two core areas - creating the world&apos;s largest, and fastest growing developer communities - for whom we build the products, services and technologies on which they&apos;ll build their products and services. With brands like MySQL, Java and OpenSolaris - we measure and drive their adoption very aggressively.
&lt;P&gt;
And secondly, we deliver compelling commercial offers to those deploying applications - across a diversity of industries - through commercial subscription, services and optimized system products. That is, we sell datacenter systems, software and services.
&lt;P&gt;
We&apos;re focused on today&apos;s customers with our current products and services, and tomorrow&apos;s customers with our investments in freely distributed software.
&lt;P&gt;
Operationally, we&apos;re focused on execution - in the field, in the labs, and on behalf of our shareholders. Innovation loves a crisis, even when the stock markets don&apos;t - and Sun&apos;s positioned very well to supply the platforms on which the next generation of clouds will be built.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What are you hearing from customers?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
It really depends upon industry and geography. From Wall St. I&apos;ve heard, &quot;I can&apos;t take your call until I crawl out from under my desk,&quot; (only a slight exaggeration) - at the other extreme, an executive at a professional social networking company said, &quot;we&apos;re being crushed with new accounts.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
But there are three basic themes I&apos;m hearing.
&lt;P&gt;
The first is a profound concern surrounding the global economy. If the headlines are bad, you hold off consumer spending - if you hold off on consumer spending, the headlines are likely to worsen. It&apos;s tough to break that cycle.
&lt;P&gt;
The second is a reaffirmation of the importance of technology - for discovering drugs, running businesses, modeling supply chains and automating business processes, technology&apos;s not getting less important, it&apos;s getting more important. Even if budgets are tight in the near term.
&lt;P&gt;
The third is the need for change - one executive to whom I spoke recently said her entire discretionary budget was consumed by one proprietary vendor&apos;s price increase. So she&apos;s out looking for an alternative, and MySQL fits the bill. Which is to say, necessity&apos;s the mother of invention - and there&apos;s a lot of necessity going around right now.
&lt;P&gt;
_____________________
&lt;P&gt;All in all, it was a tough quarter for Sun and our customers - but we&apos;re emboldened by the progress we made in our emerging markets and technology areas, investments we plan on amplifying and accelerating. Investments whose adoption will be hastened by customers facing new choices.
&lt;P&gt;
Stay tuned for our newest storage announcements on November 10th... just as the popping of the internet bubble let loose a flood of innovation for the server world, the global credit crisis is about to shake up the storage industry, too.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I thought I&apos;d share a note I sent earlier in the week to Sun&apos;s leaders - about the turmoil we&apos;re seeing in the markets, and how I want our team focusing their efforts. 
&lt;P&gt;
_______________________________________________________________________________
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Begin forwarded message:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From&lt;/b&gt;: Jonathan Schwartz &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Date&lt;/b&gt;: September 30, 2008 12:02:29 AM PDT&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To&lt;/b&gt;: All Sun&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;: Headlines, Financial Crisis, etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
You can&apos;t have missed today&apos;s headlines - the American Congress failed to pass a critical bill authorizing the Treasury to put a floor under the US banking sector. The market swooned, and politicians in the US, and across the world, are bickering over the right long term answer - jump in and take action to save the troubled institutions, or step aside and let the market sort it out. Several more banks/insurers were shuttered or bailed out today - I&apos;m confident we haven&apos;t seen the last of these collapses and rescues.
&lt;P&gt;
And I know there are questions about &quot;how does this affect Sun?&quot; Well, I believe almost all our core customers will be affected - not just the banks, but the telcos, hospitals, media companies, construction firms, airlines, governments, startups, you name it. Every customer that depends upon credit as a means of financing their business - whether it&apos;s a university or a Fortune 100 transportation company - is going to be under severe stress.
&lt;P&gt;
It&apos;s also going to create a huge opportunity - if we&apos;re on offense. Not on defense, not worried about the impact on Sun, but driving the outcomes for Sun&apos;s customers and shareholders.
&lt;P&gt;
And here are a few important things to remember.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Our customers look to technology as a means of driving value and productivity.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
You&apos;re not going to hear from any of our customers, &quot;let&apos;s stop buying technology and hire more people to do the work.&quot; They&apos;re going to default to the opposite - automating work, and finding answers and opportunities with technology, not headcount. And in that process lies an opportunity for Sun - to engage with customers in driving down cost, driving up utilization, and driving the changes that yield immediate and long term benefit. The right question for every customer you meet is - &quot;how can I help?&quot; I assure you, they&apos;ll have ideas for us. And we have no shortage of ideas for them. Personally, I&apos;m reaching out to customers and partners just to check in and offer help - I&apos;d recommend you do the same.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. That said, we are aggressively expanding our customer base.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Our concentration in financial services and telecommunications is exactly why we&apos;re working so hard to expand our customer base. We&apos;re dramatically underpenetrated in the global market - and that represents a great opportunity. I need every executive to think seriously, esp. in the market-facing portions of the organization, about growing our current relationships and growing new customers. The &apos;and&apos; is important - growth matters in both contexts.
&lt;P&gt;
And why do I think we have permission to grow new customers?
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3. Because innovation loves a crisis.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Remember the bursting of the internet bubble? The initial wave of open source adoption followed that collapse some six or seven years ago. That same zeal for breakthrough, game changing economics is back with a vengeance - and this time, Sun&apos;s positioned as the single biggest potential beneficiary. Want proof? As companies move to lower the cost of proprietary database vendors, their number one choice is: MySQL. The number one choice to lower spending on proprietary storage: ZFS with OpenStorage. How will the proprietary alternatives fare against xVM? Glassfish? Lustre? OpenSolaris? Same, from where I sit. There&apos;s opportunity everywhere I look.
&lt;P&gt;
We can, and should, be on offense across the board. From our newest Batoka and M-Series SPARC systems, to our newest Constellation Intel and AMD blades, from our network identity offerings (talk about automating labor-intensive processes!) to leveraging our amazing SunRay thin clients, or our PS and Support Services capabilities - we have the most powerful offers we&apos;ve had in years. Imagine if our portfolio had been this strong when the dot com bubble burst - we&apos;d have swept the floor, and been in a dramatically different spot.
&lt;P&gt;
Which is all to say, there will be no end of opinions surrounding what the US, or the EU, or the Asian governments should be doing to bolster economic performance. I&apos;m not that interested in the public debate - I am infinitely more interested in the private debate - going on inside every one of our customers surrounding &quot;which OS will we pick?&quot; &quot;What&apos;s my open source strategy?&quot; &quot;How can I radically reduce spending on proprietary storage?&quot; &quot;How can I save on power and space?&quot; Which vendor understands my problems?&quot; &quot;Which vendors are asking if they can help - which are truly my partners?&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 160px;&quot; src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/40QnsbLyxlMwSDu82ehNf6dErXO*XNr23zWej*zQLORqnocbmSPqIH0SWhVWDZ3iTQ77il0Y45JDFwhUV5DiyI0eYd7RC0-k/open_door.jpg
&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 


In times of crisis, we have a big opportunity to stand apart from our peers, to be better connected to the market, even if it&apos;s in turmoil. Yes, our customers are going to be under stress, but that&apos;s simply another way of saying &quot;open to change.&quot; And I want Sun to be the company engaging them in the transition - with our ideas and our roadmaps. The door is open.
&lt;P&gt;
And yes, we will see some customers disappear - we will also see many emerge even stronger. And the market, as it&apos;s done for the past 30 years, will return to growth - led by the companies that took advantage of the downturn to become even more valuable, to grow even faster.
&lt;P&gt;
So I want to assure you, we are watching the market very carefully, to understand the impact on Sun, and the challenges in front of us - on a macro and micro level. But I and my leadership team know the drill, we&apos;ve seen this before when the last bubble burst - *now is the time* to get in front of the opportunity, and firmly establish new ground. Now&apos;s the time our customers will be most open to change.
&lt;P&gt;
Let&apos;s be sure we&apos;re there to help - and to take advantage of the opportunity.
&lt;P&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;B&gt;UPDATE at bottom.&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.greenplum.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 160px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.greenplum.com/images/greenplum_logo.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

I just wanted to extend my congratulations to the team at Greenplum, and our joint customers at Fox Interactive Media - the folks behind MySpace, Photobucket, IGN, FOXSports.com, and a whole series of web properties that together represent one of the single largest audiences on the web. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 160px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/myspace.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

All three of us &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-09/sunflash.20080924.2.xml&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/A&gt; today that Fox is running a massive production data warehouse built atop Greenplum&apos;s data warehousing software on Sun&apos;s Solaris/ZFS based OpenStorage platforms (a sea of Thumpers, to be specific). That is to say, open source software is at the core of one of the world&apos;s largest - and most affordable - data warehouses.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.nyse.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 80px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.nyse.com/images/about/nyx_logo-realtime.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

Fox joins a series of joint Sun/Greenplum customers, from LinkedIn to the New York Stock Exchange, in looking to open source databases and innovation as a vehicle to drive better insight, faster decisions and more efficiency.
&lt;P&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 80px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

Which is to say, customers that are tired of proprietary vendors with a knack for raising license fees during economic downturns have a clear set of remarkably affordable alternatives. Based on commodity economics everyone can understand.
&lt;P&gt;
Congratulations to all involved!
&lt;P&gt;
______________________________
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;UPDATE&lt;/B&gt;: I&apos;ve gotten a fair number of inquiries from folks wanting to know how the Greenplum/Thumper data warehouse discussed above prices out against its competitors - given that one recently announced proprietary entrant has suggested $15,000 per terabyte is acceptable to customers. My view is that&apos;s a pre-bubble price, and roughly an order of magnitude too expensive in today&apos;s market - and unlikely to garner more than headlines. But that&apos;s obviously a biased view, I&apos;d check with a few customers to find out what they want to pay.

        <content type="html">A few years back, I remember sitting with a group of customers talking about wine, and virtualization (a natural pairing, if ever one existed). Wine, because we were at an event Sun was hosting in Napa Valley, the heart of California&apos;s wine country - virtualization, because the attendees were data center professionals who&apos;d come to talk about the future. 

&lt;a&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.turleywinecellars.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 80px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Wine.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;P&gt;
The customers in attendance all ran very high scale, high value data centers, who would deservedly respond to the accusation that they &quot;hugged&quot; their servers with &quot;and what of it?&quot; They were the individuals who kept some of the world&apos;s most valuable systems running with exceptional reliability.
&lt;P&gt;
But they were all starting to see and worry about the same thing, running applications in &quot;virtualized&quot; grids of networked infrastructure (&quot;cloud computing&quot; wasn&apos;t yet in vogue, or I&apos;m sure someone would&apos;ve used the term).
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Barrels.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 


Now, virtualization is a simple concept with a fancy name (abbreviated to &quot;v12n&quot; by the cognoscenti - by that method, I am &quot;j14z&quot;). It&apos;s simply slicing up physical computers into many smaller &quot;virtual&quot; computers, each of which can be outfitted with its own OS and application stack. 
&lt;P&gt;
That is, not only does a virtualized computer take on the task of running multiple OS&apos;s (running atop a hypervisor, described below), but the OS&apos;s themselves might change over time, responding to load or schedule. The traditional view of &quot;computer A runs OS/Application B&quot; can now give way to a more responsive &quot;these computers are available for high priority work,&quot; without regard to operating system or architecture. A spike in on-line shopping might reallocate more &quot;virtual&quot; machines to transaction processing during peak shopping hours, shifting to a different OS/app stack when the frenzy dies down. Capacity moves from fixed to fungible.
&lt;P&gt;
Although desktop virtualization wasn&apos;t the focus of these customers, most live in a world with multiple desktop OS&apos;s, too - it&apos;s not that they all (like me) run five different desktop OS&apos;s, most don&apos;t - it&apos;s that they have multiple generations of Windows, or no longer have the source code to legacy applications, a condition that dictates you keep old OS&apos;s (and hardware) around. Desktop virtualization enables users to run multiple OS&apos;s side by side on a single desktop, and divorces software upgrades from hardware upgrades (an innovation keeping CIO&apos;s and developers smiling).
&lt;P&gt;
Back to the datacenter, virtualization can enable extreme infrastructure consolidation - decoupling applications from hardware drives more efficient capacity planning and system purchases. And as exciting as that was to everyone, if things went wrong, you could also tank the quarter, blow those savings and end your career. So, why all the anxiety?
&lt;P&gt;
If I could sum it up, these customers worried that virtualization would dissolve the control they&apos;d carefully built to manage extreme reliability. In essence, they could hug a virtualized mainframe or an E25K (hugging is the act of paying exquisite attention to an individual machine), but it&apos;s far harder to hug a cloud. Nor can you ask a cloud why it&apos;s slow, irritable, or flaky, questions more easily answered with a single, big machine.
&lt;P&gt;
As the wine soothed their anxieties, a few of them began to draw out their vision of an ideal cloud environment (our laptops were open to take notes). Summarized, here&apos;s what they wanted:
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Stethoscope.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;Extreme diagnosability&lt;/b&gt;. Datacenter veterans know that things rarely run as planned, so assuming from the outset you&apos;re looking for problems, bottlenecks or optimization opportunities is a safer bet than assuming everything will go as expected. They all wanted ultimate security in responding to the question &quot;what if something goes wrong?&quot; - their jobs were on the line.
&lt;P&gt;
Second, they wanted &lt;b&gt;extreme scalability&lt;/b&gt; - they all believed the move toward horizontally scaled grids (lots of little systems, &apos;scaled out&apos;), would give way (as it always does) to smaller numbers of bigger systems (&apos;scaled up&apos;). We&apos;re seeing that already, with the move toward multi-core cpu&apos;s creating 16, 32, 64 even 128 way systems in a single box, lashed together with very high performance networking.
&lt;P&gt;
But scalability applies to management overhead, as well - having 16,000 virtualized computers is terrific (like 16,000 puppies), until you have to manage and maintain them. Often the biggest challenge (and expense) in a high scale datacenter isn&apos;t the technology, it&apos;s the breadth of point products or people managing the technology. So &lt;b&gt;seamless management&lt;/b&gt; had to be our highest priority, with extreme scale (internet scale) in mind.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/wintel.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;
They wanted a &lt;b&gt;general purpose, hardware and OS independent approach&lt;/b&gt;. That is, they wanted a solution that ran on any hardware vendor they chose, not just on Sun&apos;s servers and storage, but Dell&apos;s, IBM&apos;s, HP&apos;s, too. And they wanted a solution that would support Microsoft Windows, Linux and not just Solaris. Ideally embraced and endorsed by Microsoft, Intel, AMD, and not just Sun. 

&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And finally, they wanted open source&lt;/b&gt;. After years of moving toward and relying upon open source software, they didn&apos;t want to reintroduce proprietary software into the most foundational layer of their future datacenters. Some wanted the ability to &quot;look at the code,&quot; to ensure security, others wanted the freedom to make modifications for unique workloads or requirements.
&lt;P&gt;
And with that feedback, the answer to the above seemed obvious to one attendee, &quot;why can&apos;t you guys just use Solaris?&quot; They all ran Solaris in mission critical deployment, all appreciated its performance, they loved the diagnosability (via &lt;A HREF=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115755300770755096-R2Ct41cQ4ZIPMwk4_xh0xU_HnQI_20061011.html&quot;&gt;delivered via DTrace&lt;/A&gt;), and the capacity to scale to the largest systems on earth. It was the perfect answer until one of the customers asked, &quot;do Windows customers want to run Solaris? I don&apos;t think so.&quot; The &quot;Solaris&quot; brand didn&apos;t convey OS neutrality - and that neutrality was core to what we were thinking. But we knew the underlying inventory of OpenSolaris innovations would certainly give us a fabulous headstart.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/software/products/xvm/index.jsp&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 230px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/stevewilson/resource/xvm-portfolio.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

That&apos;s the rough backdrop to what drove our &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-09/sunflash.20080910.1.xml&quot;&gt;virtualization announcements&lt;/A&gt; last week - a desire to solve problems for developers and datacenter operators in multi-vendor environments. If you look to the core of our xVM offerings, you&apos;ll see exactly how we responded to the requirements outlined above: we integrated DTrace for extreme diagnosability. We leveraged the scale inherent in our kernel innovations to virtualize the largest systems on earth. We&apos;ve built a clean, simple interface to manage clouds (called xVM OpsCenter, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/stevewilson/entry/an_update_on_xvm_server&quot;&gt;click here for more details&lt;/A&gt;), to address management and provisioning for the smallest to the largest datacenters. And everything&apos;s available via open source (and free download), endorsed by our industry peers (watch &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://channelsun.sun.com/video/featured/featured+media/1631259652/introducing+sun+xvm+virtualization+portfolio/1785267263&quot;&gt;these launch videos&lt;/a&gt; to see Microsoft and Intel endorse xVM - no, that&apos;s not a typo, Microsoft endorsed xVM). We even leveraged ZFS to get a head start on storage virtualization (the next frontier).
&lt;P&gt;
And why call it xVM? To make sure everyone knew we weren&apos;t simply targeting Solaris - xVM virtualizes Microsoft Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, all other distros) alongside Solaris (8, 9 and 10). Customers can consolidate those operating systems, and similarly consolidate their hardware infrastructure - and use xVM OpsCenter to manage and maintain the whole plant. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Champagne.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

This week, we&apos;re unveiling a full line of desktop to datacenter virtualization offerings, covering desktop virtualization (xVM &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/A&gt;), datacenter virtualization (xVM Server), high scale management (xVM Ops Center), and Virtual Desktop support (xVM VDI and SunRay). All endorsed and supported by the industry, and all in use by some of the most powerful customers on earth. 
&lt;P&gt;
And to that end, I&apos;d like to offer my thanks to the customers who were present at that event a few years ago, and offer my sincere congratulations to the teams involved in bringing xVM to market, across Sun and our partner community. 
&lt;P&gt;
With all the celebration around xVM, perhaps our next customer event should be held in Champagne...

        <content type="html">It&apos;s been over a month (and three hurricanes in America) since I&apos;ve posted a blog. More than a few of you&apos;ve noticed - thanks for the prodding...
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;
http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/fan.jpg
&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;P&gt;
It&apos;s been a busy summer, on nearly every front. Customer activity hasn&apos;t slowed down, and the good news surrounding the (otherwise unfortunate) economic crisis embroiling many customers (especially those in the financial services industry, a heavy concentration for Sun) is that it&apos;s whipping up the winds of change. Customers facing spending pressure, or tiring of vendor price increases have new options, and there&apos;s a new appetite to explore those options (nothing like mandates from the CEO to reduce spending by 50%).
&lt;P&gt;
One of my more interesting recent meetings wasn&apos;t with a customer, though, it was with an equity analyst from a global financial institution. Equity analysts publish research that feeds the investment community - their (free) research and financial analysis accompanies buy/hold/sell recommendations to investors (who hopefully generate trading fees for the analyst&apos;s employers).
&lt;P&gt;
This one analyst hadn&apos;t historically followed Sun, and was in the process of developing his first rating. He wanted to focus on our storage plans - more and more of the customers whom he interviewed were focused on storage, and many were talking up a specific open source software technology: &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/whatis/&quot;&gt;ZFS&lt;/A&gt;. (Before meeting with me, he&apos;d talked to colleagues in his own IT shop, and was impressed to find some who admitted to running ZFS at home - nothing like touching your customers where they live... if you&apos;d like to have ZFS sent to you, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.sun.de/dct/forms/reg_us_2307_228_0.jsp&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt; or on the LiveCD shown at right.)
&lt;P&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.sun.de/dct/forms/reg_us_2307_228_0.jsp&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;
Granted, you can see an increasing focus on storage at Sun - the acquisition of MySQL is as much a storage acquisition, as an enhancement to Sun&apos;s developer offerings. Discussions of flash memory, the economics of archiving, the Lustre parallel file system, all point to an increasing focus on what Sun sees as an exceptional opportunity for customers (and thus, investors). Storage and computing are converging - and we&apos;re about to bring the trends that transformed the server industry a few years ago (mass engagement in open development communities, and scale achieved via clusters of commodity parts vs. proprietary technologies) to the historically closed and proprietary storage industry. 
&lt;P&gt;
Now, the notion of &quot;engaging customers in open development communities&quot; doesn&apos;t sit well among some traditional storage analysts (or our competition) who believe &quot;Storage is too mission critical to tolerate open source software.&quot; Although I appreciate that wisdom and experience, I think the market&apos;s more nuanced than that - mission critical environments don&apos;t tolerate unsupported software, true, which is why we offer 24x7 commercial support for ZFS (on Sun hardware, and &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.dell.com/solaris&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, even). But broad global adoption of key open source projects will continue to drive change deep into the world&apos;s datacenters. Gartner&apos;s prediction that 90% of world&apos;s companies will run open source software didn&apos;t specify where they&apos;d be running it - &quot;everywhere&quot; is the safest bet.
&lt;P&gt;
But back to the equity analyst - he patiently asked, &quot;Great theory, but when will you see revenue results?&quot; 
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Last year,&quot; I responded. &quot;You&apos;re seeing it accelerate.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 150px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/X4500_lowres.1024x768.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;P&gt;
As many folks know, we shipped our first ZFS based storage systems in 2007 - known as &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4540/&quot;&gt;Thumpers&lt;/A&gt;. Thumpers finished up this last year generating around $100m in billings, up 80% year over year. From a capacity perspective, we delivered roughly 90 petabytes of Thumper storage in FY2008, to some of the most demanding storage installations on earth (up ~200% y/y). What&apos;s fueling the growth? Adoption of ZFS is a clear driver (&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://sysnet.sunwarp.net/maps/?lat=27.371767300523047&amp;lng=-15.8203125&amp;zoom=2&amp;mtype=Blank&quot;&gt;this chart&lt;/A&gt; gives you a sense of where we&apos;re seeing adoption - thus revenue opportunity). But ultimately, customers are recognizing they can save money, space and power. &lt;b&gt;Thumpers are roughly twice the capacity in half the space at half the cost of the competition - $1.20/Gigabyte.&lt;/b&gt; (They also run Windows and Linux with the same hardware economics).

&lt;P&gt;
Now, our view is &quot;OpenStorage&quot; (systems built from commodity parts and open source software) will grow far faster than the proprietary storage market. We plan on driving that growth, and over the next few months, you&apos;ll see a tremendous amount of storage innovation targeting the growing breadth of customers wanting better/faster/cheaper/smaller options. Expect to see flash, zfs, dtrace, and good old fashioned systems engineering play a very prominent role in an aggressive push into the storage market.
&lt;P&gt;
And in case you missed &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-09/sunflash.20080905.1.xml&quot;&gt;our announcement&lt;/A&gt; last week, our progress was validated by industry analysis - IDC said customers are growing their disk storage business with Sun far faster than with any of our proprietary competition. And at three times the rate of the overall market&apos;s growth. A great place to start.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-rebpalmtrees29jan29,0,4799509.story&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 175px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.sun-sentinel.com/media/photo/2006-01/21618526.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;

If you&apos;d like to know more, and might be interested in taking a Thumper system for a free trial run, just &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/tryandbuy/applyonline.jsp?puuid=391d17f4-e2fe-11db-8c3c-080020a9ed93&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt; and pick the country in which you&apos;re located. We supply most systems at Sun for free trials across the globe (yes, we even cover shipping to you). If you like the system, please buy it. If not, we&apos;ll take care of getting it returned to Sun, you owe us nothing. (That&apos;s the closest we can get to free hardware downloads...)
&lt;P&gt;
As I said to the analyst, you need only look to the results we&apos;re already delivering to see the linkage between open innovation and revenue growth. ZFS won&apos;t transform demand for our legacy products, but it&apos;ll certainly transform the opportunity and industry unfolding before us. But don&apos;t just get our opinion, the best folks to validate our approach aren&apos;t at Sun, they&apos;re among the storage buyers finally feeling the winds of change - at their backs.

        <content type="html">I was with a customer last week, who leads technology and operations for one of the world&apos;s largest companies. We were talking through his priorities for the upcoming year, and on a page filled with various traditional priorities (consolidation, energy management, disaster recovery, regulatory compliance) were two interesting words.
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Open Source.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
I asked what that meant, why it was there. He said they&apos;d done an audit of the firm&apos;s development activities, and found an overwhelming number (&quot;hundreds&quot;) of open source 

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 120px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Opensource.svg/180px-Opensource.svg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;
projects that had been completed behind the scenes, beyond management&apos;s oversight. The projects were designed to solve problems deemed too expensive or difficult to solve with proprietary technologies - from meeting a tough budget, to automating a new process. And rather than fight the trend, they figured it was delivering real benefit, something to explore more fully. And they were asking for Sun&apos;s help.
&lt;P&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
I&apos;m seeing this with nearly every customer I meet, the invisible hand of open source - communities of individuals equally devoted to their employers, and to personal and peer productivity. These communities, within companies as well as across industries, are solving problems without having to involve procurement (while religiously adhering to policies surrounding privacy, intellectual property protection and software licensing). They&apos;re delivering unquestionable value.
&lt;P&gt;
Now, is unprescribed technology usage all that unusual in the workplace? I don&apos;t think so - it&apos;s similar to choosing your favorite search engine or social network, choices we all make (even CIO&apos;s) without purchase orders, that definitely bear on workplace productivity. Most progressive CIO&apos;s are trying to embrace this trend rather than fight it, figuring out how they can mandate as little as possible, not as much as possible - selecting only the most critical policies and standards to drive efficiency or compliance.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 120px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

The invisible hand of open source adoption is definitely changing IT, and it&apos;s changing Sun&apos;s market opportunity - in software, &lt;A HREF=&quot;	http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/28/sun_dziuba_tm/
&quot;&gt;servers&lt;/A&gt; and storage systems. Before Sun acquired them, MySQL had already established themselves among the world&apos;s open source communities, and invisibly penetrated an enormous breadth of companies across the world. From where I sit, the acquisition changed MySQL&apos;s standing not so much among developers, but among traditional technology decision makers - by bridging the divide that separated them. A well adopted product became a safe choice for enterprise deployment. The acquisition opened new doors and business dialog - we&apos;ve seen a substantive increase in sales and download activity since it was announced. We&apos;ve also seen a fair number of CIO&apos;s, as above, asking their teams - &quot;where are we using MySQL?&quot; The answers are always interesting.
&lt;P&gt;
As those conversations transition to sales cycles for MySQL Enterprise subscriptions (for those seeking mission crtiical support, eg), the number one question I get asked by traditional customers has become... &quot;...but does MySQL scale?&quot;
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/img/pic/pic_logo_119x32.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;


And there&apos;s no better way of putting that question to rest than citing the global businesses powered by MySQL - at least one of which is often used by the very individual asking the question: LinkedIn. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080728/20080728005247.html?.v=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; to read how Sun and LinkedIn are working together to serve one of the world&apos;s largest, most valuable, and fastest growing social networks - at truly global scale.
&lt;P&gt;
At the pace LinkedIn is growing, they will be managing services to far more accounts than most of the world&apos;s banks... and building exceptional value along the way. (And if you haven&apos;t signed up yet, you &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com&quot;&gt;really ought to&lt;/A&gt;...)

I remember a dinner I had a while back with the CEO of a global financial services firm. As one of his first acts as CEO, he&apos;d cancelled an enormous outsourcing contract, and I&apos;d asked him why - his response has stuck with me. &amp;quot;Banking is a technology business. Pure and simple. I can&apos;t win if I don&apos;t have my own team.&amp;quot;

   
  
  
  
  
  
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Independent of his views on outsourcing, I&apos;ve heard the same point made by many (but not all) financial services executives - banking (like big swaths of telecommunications, media and retailing) has become a technology business, where every ounce of performance and differentiation matters. Even, and especially, in the midst of market turmoil.

&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
Which is a fitting backdrop for a joint &lt;a href=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080701/20080701005384.html?.v=1&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; we just issued with Intel - in which we achieved a land speed record - a &lt;b&gt;million messages per second&lt;/b&gt;, running the Reuters Market Data System on Solaris 10 for Intel silicon (see release for details). To our colleagues at Intel and Thomson Reuters... thank you! Performance = market advantage, energy savings, or datacenter consolidation&amp;nbsp; - or all of the above. Customers get to pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; And following up on my last post on the impact of flash memory and ZFS on the world of datacenters, our own Adam Leventhal has added a far more fulfilling technical perspective in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mags.acm.org/communications/200807/?searchterm=adam+leventhal&amp;amp;pg=49&quot;&gt;Communications of the ACM: Flash Storage Memory&lt;/a&gt;.Worth the read...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are only two kinds of storage devices - those that have failed, and those that are about to fail. That&apos;s the view most datacenters have about the traditionally mechanical devices pejoratively referred to as &amp;quot;spinning rust.&amp;quot; All disk drives fail, cheap drives fail faster.

&lt;a&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 20px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 180px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/JBOD.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
If the average time to fail is five years, you and your laptop can make do with the occasional backup. But when an average enterprise has 100, or 1,000, or increasingly 10,000 or 100,000 individual disk drives, failure is a daily, if not hourly occurrence. Mechanical devices fail.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
And with failure comes the potential for losing data - using commodity disks to save your boss $500,000 does her no good if she&apos;s fined $50,000,000 for violating data retention regulations. Stock transactions, medical images or feature length movies - take your pick, some data has to be perfect. Not a decimal point or pixel out of place.
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
That&apos;s exactly why, years ago, Sun invented a storage platform called ZFS. ZFS makes a powerful assumption - that a reliable system must be built from unreliable parts. By using surplus computing cycles, ZFS constantly runs powerful integrity checks, giving data corruption no place to hide. With ZFS, customers can use the cheapest disks and simplest systems, and get exceptional data integrity, along with massive reductions in cost and complexity. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 170px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/DRAM.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

But there&apos;s a new option on the table, known to many by the memory cards they use in their phones, iPods or digital cameras - called Flash memory. Flash is very fast at reading and writing data, like DRAM (the memory chips in your computer). Its price sits squarely between DRAM and traditional disk drives. But unlike either alternative, Flash requires &lt;b&gt;no power&lt;/b&gt; to remember data. And with the price of electricity escalating across the world, keeping 10,000 disks spinning at thousands of rpm can cost you in power what you pay for your storage. Power has become &lt;a href=&quot;/jonathan/entry/hugging_customers&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;the dominant factor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in high scale hardware decisions - and Flash is set to disrupt the industry. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
Historically, there have been two impediments to using Flash in the enterprise. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/flash/Products_FlashSSD.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; cursor: pointer; width: 170px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/Flash2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


The first was cost. Flash is more expensive per gigabyte than a comparable disk drive. But with every increase in the cost of electricity (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storagesearch.com/semico-art1-fig1.gif&quot;&gt;decay&lt;/a&gt; in the price of Flash memory), Flash&apos;s relative cost &lt;i&gt;per available gigabyte&lt;/i&gt; is quickly improving - remember, disk drives have to be powered on to be available. 
And although a gigabyte of mechanical disk might cost you less than a gigabyte of Flash memory, the latter is at least an order of magnitude faster in reading and writing data - so the cost &lt;i&gt;per gigabyte served&lt;/i&gt; is exceptionally low.
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensparc.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 170px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/CPU.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But simply introducing Flash as yet another tier of storage in a datacenter isn&apos;t the real opportunity - that adds new costs and a set of new management hassles. To truly change the industry, adding Flash would have to be completely transparent to users and operators, alike, with no switching or operational cost. And that&apos;s exactly what we&apos;re doing with ZFS. ZFS will &lt;a href=&quot;http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/fs/zfs/arc.c#3377&quot;&gt;transparently incorporate&lt;/a&gt; Flash into the storage hierarchy of a running system, using the microprocessor cache for the most performance sensitive tasks, DRAM for the next, then Flash, then disk (then ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;/jonathan/entry/moving_a_petabyte_of_data&quot;&gt;tape&lt;/a&gt;). ZFS will allow Flash to join DRAM and commodity disks to form a
hybrid pool automatically used by ZFS to achieve the best price, performance and energy efficiency conceivable. Simply put, our storage and server systems will get enormously faster - without any upgrade to the microprocessor. Adding Flash will be like adding DRAM - once it&apos;s in, there&apos;s no new administration, just new capability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;That&apos;s one reason we&apos;re so excited by Flash - the cost &lt;i&gt;per available gigabyte served&lt;/i&gt; (the total operational cost of storage) plummets with Flash in the mix, especially for data or performance intensive applications (like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle or SQL Server). From the right systems designs, Flash has the potential of providing orders of magnitude improvements in economics and performance - and with the advent of Sun&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://openxvm.org/learn.html&quot;&gt;xVM&lt;/a&gt; hypervisor, we can bring this performance benefit to any host operating system (running atop xVM, Windows operators can inherit the benefit of ZFS+Flash, too).&amp;nbsp;  
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
The second problem is trickier - simply put, although Flash memory can be read an infinite number of times, writing to Flash more than a few hundred thousand times can wear it out. Now, most normal humans will never hit 500,000 writes in a digital camera. But you might in your enterprise. What to do? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 130px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/zfs_white.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Again, ZFS to the rescue.
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
ZFS treats Flash memory like any other storage medium - remember, all storage devices fail - and manages data integrity whether failure&apos;s induced by a bad hard drive motor, write-fatigue or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naKd9nARAes&amp;amp;%u205E%u205E%u205ENR=1&quot;&gt;hammer drill&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlinetips.org/cordless-hammer-drill&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 150px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.onlinetips.org/images/hammer-drill.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


Increasingly sophisticated &amp;quot;wear leveling&amp;quot; algorithms are also maximizing Flash lifespans - evening out write activity to avoid hot spot failures. But the bottom line is this - with ZFS at the helm, wear is a non-issue (on hard drives or Flash - they both have wear limitations, after all).
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
These are the premises behind Sun&apos;s systems approach to Open Storage. We&apos;re integrating ZFS, Flash memory and some exceptional hardware/silicon innovations to deliver high performance, low power, general purpose storage and server appliances - accelerating &lt;i&gt;any software that runs on our SPARC or x86 systems &lt;/i&gt;(MySQL users, in specific, will see a big turbo charge). For a fraction of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080529163415471&quot;&gt;proprietary NAS storage&lt;/a&gt; ordinarily costs. Expect our first Flash systems to ship toward the end of this calendar year. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com/get/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/OpenSolaris_CDimage.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
And as you might expect, ZFS and all the underlying software will be free without commercial support -  OpenSolaris, ZFS, MySQL and Postgres are already available (click the image at left to get a free LiveCD - or check out Apple&apos;s release of ZFS in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/snowleopard/&quot;&gt;Mac OSX&lt;/a&gt;). Software revenue will come from those enterprises that want Sun&apos;s technical support for mission critical deployment. On the hardware side, Sun&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sun.com/tryandbuy/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Try and Buy&lt;/a&gt; programs allow any partner or customer to order one of our systems for free 60 day trial - if you love it, buy it. If not, we&apos;ll cover the return postage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;If the above doesn&apos;t make it obvious... our view is Flash is anything but a flash in the pan - as the price of power continues to increase, and the price of Flash continues to plummet, the combination of Flash, ZFS and true systems innovation will have an even bigger impact on datacenter economics than virtualization. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
It&apos;s that big a deal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr width=&quot;100%&quot; size=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; You may have seen we added yet another company to the list led by Intel, IBM and Dell supporting Solaris (and thus ZFS) as OEM partners - this morning, we officially announced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080610/20080610005598.html?.v=1&quot;&gt;addition of Fujitsu-Siemens&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations, all... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content type="html">De facto standards are the only ones that matter. 

&lt;p&gt;



That&apos;s a bit of a truism in the technology world - well intentioned standards bodies and departments of justice can do their best, but at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/27/business/worldbusiness/27telecom.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 15px 20px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;&quot;  src=&quot;/jonathan/resource/emergingconsumers.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
the end of the day, volume deployment is the only setter of standards. Ubiquity trumps policy, just about every time.

&lt;p&gt;

To that point, I was on a panel recently, discussing the impact of technology on the world&apos;s more rapidly developing economies (what&apos;s often referred to as &amp;quot;BRICA,&amp;quot; or Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa).

&lt;p&gt;

One of the speakers referenced an interesting shift in the traditional media industry: western companies were turning their attention toward the developing world. GDP growth wasn&apos;t drawing their attention - as much as demographics. Teenagers and those in their early twenties represent the biggest media buyers in the world, spending a greater portion of their income on music, movies and entertainment than any other age group. And the majority of people fitting that age profile live, by definition, in population centers - not in the US, UK, or Germany, but BRICA. Whose collective population represents &lt;em&gt;nearly half the entire planet&apos;s&lt;/em&gt;. Think of the Ovum analysis from the New York Times, pictured on the right, more as growth in media outlets - and remember, more people in the world see &quot;the internet&quot; on their phone, than on a PC.

  &lt;p&gt;

The impact of that shift in buying power won&apos;t be limited to traditional media. The software industry is a media industry, as well - technically, the two have fully converged (a digital file is a digital file, whether it&apos;s OpenSolaris, MySQL, a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=DqJlEVvr52Q&quot;&gt;Jay Chou&lt;/a&gt; video, or a champion cricket highlight). The infrastructure to distribute and manipulate that content (eg, servers, networking, storage and infrastructure software) is increasingly geared to serve consumers - the &amp;quot;business to consumer&amp;quot; (or, B2C) segment of the IT marketplace is growing far, far faster than &amp;quot;business to business&amp;quot; (B2B). 

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 90px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/jay1.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/A&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 29px 0px 10px 10px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 30px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/os_com_logo.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/A&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;https://video.cricinfo.tv/video_player.aspx?channelId=CHCricInfo&apos;,&apos;CricInfoPlayer&apos;,&apos;width=720,height=1021&apos;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; float: left; cursor: pointer; height: 90px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/cricket.jpeg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/A&gt;

And where will the market for such network computing infrastructure be largest? By definition, where the markets are centered - near consumers (more than half of whom now live in urban environments, well covered by mobile network service). If B2B caused the IT industry to concentrate in proximity to economic centers (the G7), B2C focuses our attention on consumers and population centers (the P7?). That&apos;s a profound change.


  &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
So with that backdrop, I&apos;ve made a few significant changes to how Sun&apos;s organized, focusing leadership and resourcing around two new areas. &lt;/p&gt; 

  &lt;p&gt;First, as many folks know inside of Sun, I announced the addition of Lin Lee to my staff, to manage relationships with governments and NGO&apos;s across the world. Based in Shanghai, Lin will advocate Sun&apos;s vision of sustainable network infrastructure, encompassing open source and document formats to power efficient datacenters - we&apos;ve already found a very receptive audience in emerging economies. Lin&apos;s focus will be helping students, universities and governments to lower the barriers to indigenous opportunity. 

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 180px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/flowersprout.png&quot; /&gt;I also announced today a new leader reporting to me for Sun&apos;s Global Sales and Services organization, Peter Ryan. He&apos;s also added to his staff a new business region, Emerging Markets - with a new leader (Denis Heraud). Emerging Markets, representing a basket of rapidly developing economies (BRICA included), will be a peer to North America, Europe and Asia. Last quarter alone, our BRICA business grew in double digits - this change is designed to accelerate that growth by adding new focus, resourcing and strong leadership.
&lt;P&gt;

Peter (who disclosed to me only this weekend that he started his career as a mainframe systems engineer!) replaces Don Grantham. (Don&apos;s leaving Sun to help HP secure a Solaris license before their EDS transaction closes...)

&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sun.com/sunray/sunray2/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/sunray_small.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/A&gt; Rapidly developing economies have, of late, started throwing their weight around in the world of traditional IT standards - and have been among the most assertive in embracing and &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-03/sunflash.20080304.2.xml&quot;&gt;deploying&lt;/A&gt; free/open source software. Quite naturally, they&apos;ve also been among the most concerned about sustainable technology practices: 100,000,000 new PC users, each drawing 200 watts, certainly paves the way for social and economic progress - at the cost of ~20 gigawatts of new coal fired power plants. Now you know why our SunRay desktops, at 4 watts apiece, have been of such interest in the developing (and developed) world.

&lt;p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Bluntly put, we&apos;re elevating our focus on developing economies because that&apos;s where free software, and Sun&apos;s businesses, are growing fastest. Where is OpenOffice deployed in the greatest numbers? In places where saving $300 per desktop is meaningful. 

&lt;p&gt;

No wonder those economies are so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/30/brazil_appeals_against_oomxl/&quot;&gt;passionate&lt;/a&gt; about open standards - their citizenry will ultimately make them the most important decision makers in the world. 

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I was sitting across from the CEO of a media company. He showed enormous pride in the social value of his organization - in delivering news to the world via a global team of thoughtful, award-winning journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px; cursor:pointer; width: 180px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/2008_Sichuan_earthquake_map_no_labels.svg/240px-2008_Sichuan_earthquake_map_no_labels.svg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asked what made me proud to be at Sun. Among a number of things, I said I&apos;m proudest of the role Sun plays in making sure stories like his are told - &quot;Our technologies, after all, are how your journalists file their stories, and we play a central role in how you present them to the world via the network.&quot; I am unreservedly proud of Sun&apos;s role in making the world a more open, transparent place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond professional journalism, the network is a social utility for the world&apos;s citizenry - whose digital cameras and cell phones and blog postings and emails form a tidal wave of transparency. We live in a world whose traumas and triumphs are visible instantaneously. Sunlight&apos;s not just a great disinfectant, it&apos;s a wonderful safety net, too - you can&apos;t fix the problems you don&apos;t know about. But once you know about a problem, even small attempts to help, multiplied over the long tail of the internet, can make an extraordinary difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, the world has watched an earthquake in China lead to the death and dislocation of countless thousands. The San Francisco Bay Area, where Sun is headquartered, has felt the impact deeply - beyond co-workers, friends and family, we&apos;ve suffered our own traumas with earthquakes. A cyclone in Myanmar triggered similar thoughts among those of us effected by hurricanes in New Orleans, Louisiana.

&lt;p&gt;But the world&apos;s an increasingly transparent place. And any help, from $1 to $1m, multiplied over the world, makes a difference. 
&lt;P&gt;
Which is why I&apos;m sending personal funds to the relief organizations I trust to bring aid to those stricken. 
&lt;P&gt;
And I&apos;m encouraging you to take the time to make a similar choice.

        <content type="html">&lt;P&gt;
JavaOne wrapped up on Friday. We hosted individuals from across the globe, and from every industry: consumer electronics and gaming, to enterprise IT, space exploration, factory automation, the automotive industry, academia - like the network itself, Java delivers something for nearly everyone, everywhere.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; width: 180px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/java_dev.jpg&quot;&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
This year&apos;s biggest announcements centered around Java&apos;s role in the future of rich internet applications (or RIA&apos;s). What&apos;s a rich internet application? It depends on your perspective - from mine, it&apos;s any network connected application that persists in front of a user, typically outside a browser, that can operate when disconnected from the network.
&lt;P&gt;
On the one hand, I&apos;d claim Java&apos;s always been a RIA platform - before the world really wanted one. Early Java applets delivered interactivity, but at the expense of development complexity and, in the early days, performance - when a browser, and more recently Javascript, would suffice.
&lt;P&gt;
But browser based applications are hitting complexity and performance limits, and content owners are striving for higher levels of engagement (via high definition video, or advanced interactivity). Developers are demanding something new - the browser&apos;s a wonderfully accessible programming model, but it&apos;s a weak deployment model for rich/disconnected applications. 
&lt;P&gt;
An unspoken driver of RIA is also business model evolution - many companies behind rich applications are seeking independence from browsers and search engines, whose default settings and corporate parents present a competitive threat. There&apos;s a growing appetite for locally installed applications that build rich, direct &lt;b&gt;and permanent&lt;/b&gt; engagement with consumers. No one wants to pay a toll to meet their own customers.
&lt;P&gt;
With that in mind, as we looked to reinvent the Java platform, we heard a consistent set of requirements. And not just from coders, but from sports francishes seeking to directly engage their fans, media companies wanting to bypass browser defaults, to artists and businesses and device manufacturers - everyone&apos;s looking to uniquely engage consumers via the network. These audiences have nearly identitical requirements for a RIA platform - they want technology that:&lt;P&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;small&gt;

&lt;li type=square&gt;Reaches every internet consumer - on desktops, mobile, and new devices, too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li type=square&gt;Delivers high performance - and the ability to engage creative professsionals in the design process.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li type=square&gt;Leverages existing skills and enterprise infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li type=square&gt;Is totally free, and open source.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li type=square&gt;Provides content owners with control and ownership of their own data.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
At JavaOne last week, we addressed every one of those issues - here&apos;s how: &lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;First, RIA developers want to reach every consumer on earth, and on every device.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;

Why? Because the market is in front of consumers - no matter what screen they may be using. Desktop, mobile phone, personal navigation, digital book - you name it. The market&apos;s in front of all the screens in your life, not just a PC.&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; width: 180px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/fiona/general/Kindle_C1_03._V10214354_.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
That said, on PC&apos;s alone, Java&apos;s popularity has grown in the last few years, as measured by runtime downloads - we routinely download 40 to 50 million new Java runtimes a month, and update more than a &lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt; every year. 

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 20px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/themes/ubuntu07/images/ubuntulogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

The adoption of the Java platform exceeds the adoption of Microsoft&apos;s Windows itself - Sun&apos;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.java.com&quot;&gt;Java runtime environment&lt;/A&gt; (JRE) is preloaded on nearly every Windows machine (from HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc.), but also runs on Apple&apos;s Macintosh, Ubuntu, Fedora, SuSe, Solaris and OpenSolaris desktops. In addition, a JRE is present on billions - yes, billions - of wireless and mobile devices, from automobile dashboards and navigation devices, to Amazon&apos;s Kindle (did you know Amazon&apos;s Kindle is a Java platform?).
&lt;P&gt;
Which is to say, the Java platform reaches more people than any other software technology the world has ever seen.&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Second, RIA developers want performance, functionality AND simplicity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;

Why? Because content owners and application developers want to engage consumers - and want to engage artists and creative professionals in the workflow. &lt;P&gt;

Java&apos;s history with simplicity isn&apos;t perfect - which is why our teams have rewritten the applet model, and focused so intently on making the new consumer Java runtime environment (download a beta version &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/java6u10/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;) exceptionally fast to load within a web page, exceptionally performant for complex interactivity, and trivially accessible to consumers. We&apos;ve also simplified Java with a scripting language, JavaFX script, that enables creative professionals to engage with coders to create immersive experiences, while embracing the creative tool chain (from interaction design to pixel manipulation) used by the worlds designers and digital artists.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://news.zdnet.com/2422-13568_22-200560.html&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/fxapplets.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

And I&apos;m really pleased we&apos;ve solved the desktop installation problem, by making JavaFX applets separable from a web page with a simple drag and drop (click the image above to watch this demonstrated). Developers can now bypass the browser to trivially install apps on desktops - once the applet&apos;s dropped on the desktop, content owners have a direct relationship with their consumers.&lt;P&gt;

You might have also seen that we&apos;re adding full high quality audio and video codecs to Java on every platform on which it runs - resolving another gap for RIA developers, support for time-based media (click &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://news.zdnet.com/2422-13568_22-200368.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; for a demo of high performance video). &lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Third, enterprises want to reuse their existing Java skills and assets in moving to RIA.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;

Nearly every enterprise employs programmers with Java skills - it&apos;s still the number one internet language taught across the world, and found pervasively in global business infrastructure. As businesses move to engage their customers via RIA platforms, reusing existing skills, and connecting RIA&apos;s to existing systems, gives the Java community a unique ability to build from what exists - rather than attempt to replace it. 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 32px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/opensolaris_little.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/downloads&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 30px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;a HREF=&quot;https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/v2ur1-b09d.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:center margin:0px 10px 0px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;https://glassfish-theme.dev.java.net/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/index.php&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;margin: 24px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 130px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.netbeans.org/images/v5/nb-logo2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;

This familiarity also allows businesses and developer teams to focus on engaging with consumers - rather than irritating IT with new infrastructure requirements (JavaFX developers simply link to existing enterprise infrastructure, vs. requiring new systems for RIA apps).&lt;P&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Fourth, RIA developers want free and open platforms.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;

Why free? Because developers don&apos;t want to encumber their applications with royalty bearing dependencies, or use technologies that predefine where consumers might appear. You don&apos;t build &lt;em&gt;developer&lt;/em&gt; communities around closed source, you build &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; communities - 

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/contribute/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 110px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/images/openjdk-small.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

and this is an instance where developer selection and adoption will define the broadest RIA marketplace. JavaFX will, like all of Sun&apos;s software platforms, be made freely available as open source, and it&apos;ll be released via the GPL (v2) license.&lt;P&gt;

And lest you think free and open software is the province of those with goatees and tattoos... we&apos;re seeing a rising tide of developing nations mandating free and open software in government and academic procurement. Why? To protect choice, and build indigenous opportunity - there&apos;s no reason to build dependencies upon proprietary software if you can avoid it. &lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Lastly, lets face it, the real &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=3&quot;&gt;value in Web 2.0 is the data&lt;/A&gt; - not the app. And that data is YOURS. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.microscope.com&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.microscope.com/product_thumb.php?img=images/OMSZ55L_main.jpg&amp;w=138&amp;h=200&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

If you&apos;ve been watching the social media space as carefully as we have, you understand the value of instrumentation and intentionality in building a business on the web. Knowing what users are doing with your product, whether it&apos;s a &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.cricketweb.net/fantasycricket/&quot;&gt;fantasy cricket&lt;/a&gt; league or a consumer banking application, enables more innovative business models, the delivery of higher value services, placement of more valuable ads - data allows for better decisions, and better value creation (and bluntly  put, higher &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_action&quot;&gt;CPA&lt;/A&gt;). 
&lt;P&gt;
But most rich internet applications are built, then deployed - into a fog. Developers who leave the confines of the browser either lose access to information about what their users are doing, or have to rely upon a technology provider that&apos;s inserting itself into their data stream. And some of those technology providers compete with content developers. 
&lt;P&gt;
With a project code named &lt;b&gt;Project Insight&lt;/b&gt;, we&apos;ll be instrumenting the Java platform to enable developers to harvest the data stream generated by their RIA content. JavaFX developers can focus on their business models - rather than enhancing someone else&apos;s. &lt;P&gt;

_______________________
&lt;P&gt;
With all that said, what&apos;s the success of JavaFX worth to Sun? 
&lt;P&gt;
By definition, it&apos;s worth more to Sun than the adoption of someone else&apos;s platform (known as &quot;positive option value&quot;) - and the proprietary infrastructure used to serve it (don&apos;t forget, RIA&apos;s have rich internet back-ends (RIBs?). And in the RIA world, all the options are going to be priced at free, anyways - this isn&apos;t a contest to be won on price.
&lt;P&gt;
From where I sit, the platform likely to win will be the one that sets developers free - to pursue markets, opportunities and customer experiences as they define them, not as vendors define them. Now, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/media_shell.jsp?id=FRdamp267542&quot;&gt;setting developers free&lt;/A&gt; - that&apos;s where we can excel. It&apos;s in the DNA of everything we do.
&lt;P&gt;
For developers, learn more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javafx.com&quot;&gt;at JavaFX.com&lt;/A&gt;. And be sure to check out &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/index.php&quot;&gt;NetBeans&lt;/a&gt; - like Java itself, it&apos;s starting to rock the free world...

        <content type="html">We made some big announcements this week at our annual developer forums, CommunityOne and JavaOne. I thought I&apos;d highlight a couple in particular. &lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;https://www2.sun.de/dct/forms/reg_us_2307_228_0.jsp&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Opensolaris.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

We announced the first commercial release of OpenSolaris - targeting high speed developers and development teams (not consumers...). OpenSolaris focuses on developers wanting to be freed from proprietary software models, who see innovation and automation in operating systems as a source of competitive advantage.&lt;P&gt;

If Solaris 10, OpenSolaris&apos;s older brother, is for IT departments prioritizing carrier grade stability over rapid innovation, OpenSolaris targets the exact opposite -  developers, from high performance computing to social networking, that prioritize a constantly refreshing repository filled with community innovations (and ZFS-based automated rollback) over an unchanging qualification target. Go to &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.com&quot;&gt;OpenSolaris.com&lt;/A&gt; to download a free copy, or click on the OpenSolaris logo to have a bootable CD delivered to you (free of charge). Or if you want a simpler way of trying it out... just go to Amazon!&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=391556011&amp;no=3440661&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/00/10/00/14/19/27/100014192753._V46777512_.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

We also announced a &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=391556011&amp;no=3440661&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA&quot;&gt;partnership with Amazon&lt;/A&gt;, through which we&apos;ve made OpenSolaris, alongside MySQL and Glassfish, available with commercial support on Amazon&apos;s elastic computing cloud. From where I sit, this is a profound change in the industry - the world&apos;s most popular database is now available, and commercially supported, as a cloud service. As is the fastest growing Java container, and a redefined OpenSolaris for the modern world.&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/downloadsindex.html&quot; &gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:-15px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 90px;&quot;SRC=&quot;https://glassfish-theme.dev.java.net/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;


The traditional software industry, first revolutionized by open source, next by software as a service, is now embarking on a third revolutionary change... infrastructure as a service. 
&lt;P&gt;
Sure feels like the clouds are parting.
&lt;P&gt;
(And again, if you&apos;d like a free copy of OpenSolaris sent to you on a bootable, &quot;live&quot; CD, just click on the OpenSolaris logo above.)

        <content type="html">&lt;P&gt;
We announced the results of our third fiscal quarter (Q3) on Thursday last week, and the results weren&apos;t what I, or any of us, wanted.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.netbanker.com/Images/glass6.jpg&quot;&gt;

As you can read in the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/investor/earnings_releases/pr/fy08q3/index.html&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/A&gt;, we delivered $3.267 billion in revenue for Q3, roughly flat with a year ago. On that revenue, we delivered a GAAP loss of 4 cents (equal to the charge associated with the acquisition of MySQL, which closed within the quarter) - on that revenue, we generated around $320m in cash.
&lt;P&gt;
The low light of the quarter was revenue in the US - which declined year over year by nearly 10%, a big step down for a geography that typically contributes 40% of our total revenue. The highlight of the quarter was our India performance, up 30% year over year - and our chip multi-threading Niagara systems, which grew (billings) 110%. 
&lt;P&gt;
We had growth in 12 of 16 geographies in which we sell, but a shortfall in the world&apos;s largest economy (and the largest in Sun&apos;s portfolio), is tough to make up elsewhere. So we showed no growth at the corporate level.
&lt;P&gt;
Despite a weak US economy, we still see growth and opportunity across the world. We are going to be making some changes as a result of the quarter, certainly, but not in our core vision or strategic direction - network infrastructure is being built out across the world, developers will continue to define its architecture and shape demand, and we will continue to position ourselves to drive and capture that market.
&lt;P&gt;
With that, I&apos;ll go through a few questions:
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What happened in the US? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Late in the quarter, we saw a fairly aggressive slowdown - among smaller customers, and for larger systems (like enterprise servers and large tape libraries). As you recall, we left Q2 with a healthy backlog, lots of momentum, and feedback from customers that we were totally on the right track, so we were as surprised as anyone that deals started stalling in early March.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why did big systems slow? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&apos;s counterintuitive, but larger systems and purchase orders&apos;s are easier to slow down than smaller purchases. When you sell the systems and storage behind a big buildout, it&apos;s typically a long selling cycle, and a fairly long implementation process (systems aren&apos;t powered up the day they arrive). So holding off for a few weeks, either because you&apos;re spooked about the US mortgage crisis or because your CFO decided to put a pause on capital spending, is fairly straightforward.
&lt;P&gt;
And remember, our business is a portfolio - from high growth, low end blades and training services, to slower growth, high end enterprise systems an infrastructure software. There is no one system or product for all workloads, it&apos;s a portfolio.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So how are you going to adjust going forward? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We&apos;ll continue to diversify our business - geographically, and with the introduction of our &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storagetek/openstorage/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Open Storage&lt;/A&gt; initiatives this past week and acquisitions like MySQL and Vaau, we&apos;ll continue moving into adjacent markets.
&lt;P&gt;
We also announced a restructuring plan, through which we&apos;ll be making targeted reductions in operating expenses. The net result will be the elimination of up to 2,500 jobs.
&lt;P&gt;
To be clear - we are taking assertive, and prudent steps to focus on growth opportunities, and to pull our cost structure in line with our business model. As we&apos;ve done in years past, we&apos;re doing both - making choices to invest and disinvest.
&lt;P&gt;
Evolving companies are never done making choices.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Where did you grow in the quarter? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 12 of the 16 geographies we serve - including India (up 30%), Brazil (up 20%), up in China, Russia, the Middle East, Canada, to name a few places. In general, the world continues to look to technology as a source of growth, automation and efficiency. Even our Wall Street business was up this past quarter.
&lt;P&gt;
On the product front, our focus on energy efficiency continues to pay off, with Niagara systems grew (billings) 110% year over year, and our newest (AMD, Intel and SPARC) blade systems growing at an even higher clip. The MySQL team delivered a great growth quarter, and Service revenues were up 3% (a major portion of which are software related, of course). Disk storage billings were up 6%.
&lt;P&gt;
Deferred product revenues were again up nicely, more than 25% - these deferred revenues tend to be for higher end systems and more complex configurations, with gross margins above the corporate average. Deferred Services were down, attributable to the ERP transition I mentioned earlier (we expect to recover that in Q4).
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What didn&apos;t go well? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Enterprise systems, which were great growers in Q1 and Q2 (20% and 8% growth, respectively), were down in the quarter - and not specifically attributable to competition. We saw exceptional performance on our APL systems built with Fujitsu, and a strengthening partnership. Tape libraries were also down, although media sales were strong. 
&lt;P&gt;
Given the size of both these line items, our higher volume lower end businesses were not yet at a sufficient scale to eclipse the slowdown on the lower volume, high end systems. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why don&apos;t you just stop giving your software away? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Because we prioritize developer adoption. Let me give an example. 
&lt;P&gt;
Last week, we saw a very high profile media company raise a considerable sum of money. They had not otherwise been on our radar. I sent a note to the head of our global sales team, given the fundraising had cited a growing infrastructure buildout, and asked if we&apos;d made contact. 
&lt;P&gt;
He said no, but we were immediately reaching out - and it turns out they&apos;re completely built around MySQL. 
&lt;P&gt;
So before we arrived, before we were engaged, and before they began building out a large infrastructure, the MySQL team had scored a design win - ahead of the proprietary competition. What should we have charged them beforehand? No matter what it was, they wouldn&apos;t have used the product - startups and developers don&apos;t pay for software. But here&apos;s a diffrent question: what would we have paid them to select MySQL over the proprietary alternatives before embarking on a massive expansion? 
&lt;P&gt;
Right question. We didn&apos;t pay them, the MySQL team &lt;em&gt;earned&lt;/em&gt; their adoption.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/startup&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 400px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/startup-camp-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;



Will they buy a license now? Maybe not, but we&apos;ll be well positioned if and when they, like Facebook or Nokia or the New York Times, do. And in the interim, it costs us nothing for the reference. I was with a bunch of startups at our StartupCamp this morning, and asked how many folks in the audience *didn&apos;t* use free software... no hands were raised. Why are we focused on startups? Because we&apos;re focused on all developers, in big companies and small.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How do you feel about the competition? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just fine, we looked at the deals slowing in the US, competition wasn&apos;t our big issue - it&apos;s not that someone else was getting the purchase order, it&apos;s that no PO was being issued in the quarter. We&apos;re more exposed to the US markets, and potentially more exposed to discretionary purchases (although I don&apos;t really believe that servers are more discretionary than storage - they&apos;re &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/storagetek/openstorage/index.jsp&quot;&gt;converging&lt;/A&gt;). &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://seekingalpha.com/article/73887-avnet-s-vallee-fyq2-hurt-by-server-sales-slowdown&quot;&gt;Avnet&lt;/A&gt;, one of our big distributors, had a similar experience in the US.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why didn&apos;t you pre-announce the quarter? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We wanted to be sure, when we made our announcements, to have finalized our numbers and our plan to adjust our cost structure going forward. Given we&apos;re in the midst of an ERP transition, we were still finalizing work late into April.  Secondarily, we needed to review our FY 2009 restructuring plan with the board before going public. We announced as soon as we&apos;d met, reviewed and approved the plan. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How did you lose money compared to a year ago profit? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, although we generated a lot of cash in the quarter (more than $320m from operating activities), we also incurred a number of charges which reduced our net income. These included non-cash items related to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as well as other acquisition-related charges - all of which added up to 20 cents worth of charges.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Are you repurchasing your own shares? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We don&apos;t comment on buyback plans, but we&apos;ll report any potential purchases at the end of the quarter. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When will the US recover? Will the malaise spread overseas? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We build network innovation at Sun, we don&apos;t predict the global economy.
&lt;P&gt;
And with that, you&apos;ve hopefully got a clearer sense of what we saw, and what we see. So I&apos;ll end on a particuarly vexing question, 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Why does Sun&apos;s CEO waste time writing that blog?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because I believe in providing clarity surrounding our strategy and operations - not just once a year in the Annual Report. I believe clarity behind our direction is useful for our shareholders, customers, partners and employees.
&lt;P&gt;
In good times, and in challenging ones.

        <content type="html">Today is the opening day of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/content/home&quot;&gt;MySQL User Conference&lt;/A&gt; - so I thought I&apos;d describe a recent customer interaction related to the acquisition.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysql.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

A few weeks ago, I was visiting the Chief Information Officer of a large commercial institution. He had with him the company&apos;s Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security Officer (known as the &quot;see-so&quot;), and a series of lieutenants from various parts of their (large) development organization. 
&lt;P&gt;
The Sun team had spent the day reviewing our progress together, and was finishing up with a product roadmap presentation. From what I sensed, it&apos;d been a good day, so when I arrived, it was mostly to say thanks for the business, and ensure everyone had my contact info in the event I could help out going forward.
&lt;P&gt;
We had just closed the acquisition of MySQL, so before I wrapped up, I asked, &quot;And would you like a quick update on the newest addition to our family, MySQL?&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
The CIO responded categorically with &quot;we don&apos;t run MySQL, we run [&lt;em&gt;name withheld to protect the proprietary&lt;/em&gt;].&quot; The CISO said, &quot;We can&apos;t just let developers download software off the net, you know, we&apos;ve got regulation and security to worry about.&quot; The CTO smiled. Everyone else appeared to be sitting on their hands. I was going to leave it at that. Thanks for the business.
&lt;P&gt;
Until a (diplomatically) assertive Sun sales rep piped up, &quot;Um... no, I connected with a buddy of mine over at MySQL, and had him check - you&apos;ve downloaded MySQL more than 1,300 times in the last twelve months.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(Monty)_Widenius&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 13px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 350px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2414423398_2711e9df3f.jpg?v=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;




After a profoundly awkward silence, one of the individuals from their internal development team piped up, &quot;Actually, everybody uses it. Why bother hassling with license agreements when MySQL&apos;s got you covered. We&apos;re stoked you bought them.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
Awkward silences aside, we&apos;ve now got a very productive engagment with the customer around delivering commercial support on a global basis to what&apos;s turned out to be the most popular database inside their development shop. They&apos;re finding more and more applications for MySQL, and more ways to save significant time and money in moving toward the future. 
&lt;P&gt;
And that experience - of a CIO not knowing how ubiquitous and valuable free software has become to their organization - isn&apos;t atypical. In fact, it&apos;s the norm, and a divide we&apos;re gently trying to bridge.
&lt;P&gt;
Opportunity&apos;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/who_picked_your_search_engine1&quot;&gt;everywhere&lt;/A&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;
So is free and open software.
&lt;P&gt;
They might even travel in pairs.

If you&apos;d like the backstory on the April Fool&apos;s video making its way around Sun (below)... it goes like this. 
&lt;P&gt;
My normally trustworthy administrator let me know I had a lunch appointment with my normally trustworthy friend, Ted. So I went to a normally trustworthy restaurant, where the normally trustworthy host walked me to my table - and past a series of video cameras I foolishly didn&apos;t notice. Ted lets me know he&apos;s managed to connect with Dan, a normally trustworthy colleague, who&apos;s put him in touch with a technical expert I might be interested in meeting.
&lt;P&gt;
Ted lets me know the guest is flying up from Los Angeles. And that he&apos;s been in an accident that might impair his ability to speak. Pay special attention at minute five, marking the first time I&apos;ve seen anyone make a chicken out of a dinner napkin.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/yUdFqW7vRc0&amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/yUdFqW7vRc0&amp;rel=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; align = left&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Let me be the first to point out that the video shown was highly edited. The good (and, notwithstanding this prank, normally trustworthy) people who edited the footage exercised appropriate restraint for a global audience unaccustomed to diluvian drooling. How uncomfortable was it at the table? Having watched the unedited version with a Sun colleague before it was posted externally, she remarked, &quot;Look how well your Mother raised you, you didn&apos;t even stare.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHOPavgsM4M&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 20px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 250px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2101/2382287119_5e38bd9907_m.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
On a far more civil note, Sun&apos;s headquarters were also attacked by a herd of &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHOPavgsM4M&quot;&gt;squeaky dolphins&lt;/A&gt; yesterday, swimming in formation from right to left... rumor has it they were on their way to meet with a representative of their community who now leads our database business.

&lt;P&gt;
Oh, and Bill Macgowan is still at Sun. 
&lt;P&gt;
I hold him personally responsible for my designation as the real &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools&apos;_Day&quot;&gt;poisson d&apos;avril&lt;/A&gt; (dolphins aren&apos;t fish, after all, they&apos;re mammals), and I&apos;ll forever view him with a lingering suspicion... but he&apos;s still here.

        <content type="html">As you know, Sun&apos;s open source software and microprocessor strategy has been, at times controversial. We&apos;ve filled trade journals and chat rooms with all kinds of dialog and the occasional crackpot conspiracy theory.
&lt;P&gt;
As many have rightly assumed from the outset, that controversy was, in fact, not a byproduct of the strategy - it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the strategy: if you&apos;re talking about Sun, you&apos;re not talking about the other guy. And then you&apos;ll buy a datacenter.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.conflictmanagement.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 20px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.protectmystaff.co.uk/users/www.protectmystaff.co.uk/upload/The%20way%20personal%20safety%20hand%20grab.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

But now that we&apos;ve firmly established our reputation for open source leadership, I&apos;m very worried there&apos;s no more controversy to be had. There&apos;s too much trust in the system, and too much clarity around our strategic intent. So it&apos;s getting tougher and tougher to kick up a storm - and we can&apos;t very well spend a billion dollars or change our ticker symbol every time we want to generate a headline. Now can we?
&lt;P&gt;
So today I&apos;d like to unfurl the second chapter of our strategy.
&lt;P&gt;
We want you to give it all back. You couldn&apos;t possibly believe we&apos;d let you keep it, did you? 
&lt;P&gt;
We specifically request that all free software originally distributed by Sun Microsystems, related to software or microprocessors, including but not limited to source files, binaries, derivatives, extensions, applications, patents, patent applications, copyrights, ideas, thoughts, and derivative thoughts, along with any and all mirrors thereof, be returned immediately.
&lt;P&gt;
In addition, (we know this is the risky part, but we need to get the privacy advocates twittering, too), we demand all data processed, stored or created by such intellectual property, up to and including all data held within file systems, databases or open source productivity applications be returned, as well. Up to and including the book report your kid just typed on OpenOffice. 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
We&apos;d like to request this all be returned within thirty days. 
&lt;P&gt;
Thank you for your understanding.

&lt;P&gt;
This is Bill Macgowan. 
&lt;P&gt;
Bill is Sun&apos;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/mgt_macgowan.html&quot;&gt;Chief Human Resources Officer&lt;/A&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;
Which means he works with me to build and cultivate talent at Sun. 
&lt;P&gt;
He&apos;s bright, well spoken, and usually exercises good judgement. 
&lt;P&gt;
Usually. 
&lt;P&gt;
But today, he perpetrated a prank. On me. An &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fool&apos;s_Day&quot;&gt;April Fool&apos;s Day&lt;/A&gt; prank. 
&lt;P&gt;
Executed early enough to turn into a video for the enjoyment of Sun&apos;s employees on Tuesday (April Fool&apos;s Day). And if I have the courage to publicly display my gullibility, it&apos;ll be here, on this blog, in front of a global audience.
&lt;P&gt;
The prank, like any good Silicon Valley practical joke, involved a venture capitalist, a drooling visitor, a bib and lamb chops.
&lt;P&gt;
Owing to the graciousness with which my parents raised me, I suffered through the prank. Without staring. Focused on the business at hand.
&lt;P&gt;
Having no idea it was a prank.
&lt;P&gt;
Until all the camera men appeared. At which point I picked up on the notion something wasn&apos;t quite right. I had been spoofed.
&lt;P&gt;
Upon my humbling return from lunch, Bill caught me in the hallway. He asked, with his ill-gotten video in hand, &quot;so do I still have a job?&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
And I have until Tuesday to think up a creative response.
&lt;P&gt;
Remember, my office mate is the CFO, and the General Counsel writes a blog. Surely there&apos;s an opportunity for clever repartee.
&lt;P&gt;
Surely :)

        <content type="html">We made a very significant announcement last week, of a collaboration with one of the most (if not the most) security sensitive institutions on earth, the United States government&apos;s National Security Agency. They&apos;ve joined the burgeoning &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSolaris community&lt;/A&gt;, to collaborate with Sun and other community members on the future of ultra-secure operating systems. 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/opensolaris_little.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

To put this in context, community engagement has always been one of the most important ways Sun innovates in the marketplace - we partner with those that have extreme demands (whether it&apos;s the world&apos;s largest supercomputing facility, or the world&apos;s most paranoid security professionals (no offense intended), or the world&apos;s largest archival storage facilities), and then we leverage that expertise to create products for the mass market. We let extreme customers teach us what the rest of the world will ultimately experience. 
&lt;P&gt;
Nine times out of ten, what extreme customers experience is a great leading indicator for the industry as a whole.
&lt;P&gt;
Historically, this type of collaboration used to involve reams and reams of legal documents describing all kinds of confidentiality restrictions, intellectual property exchanges, or cumbersome institutional processes. But it got really simple when we
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.nsa.gov&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/National_Security_Agency.svg/180px-National_Security_Agency.svg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

 embraced the open source community - now our most fruitful collaborations boil down to this: &quot;come join the community.&quot; And that&apos;s exactly what we&apos;re announcing with the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.nsa.gov&quot;&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/A&gt;, they&apos;ve joined the OpenSolaris community.
&lt;P&gt;
And rather than walk through the details of our collaboration, I figured I&apos;d have Bill Vass, the president of Sun&apos;s Federal Systems Group do all the heavy lifting - so I sent him a bunch of questions, and thought I&apos;d post the resulting Q&amp;A. His responses are below. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So Bill, what did we announce?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;



That we&apos;ve formalized a relationship with the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to incorporate their security research into an OpenSolaris community project called &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/fmac/&quot;&gt;Flexible Mandatory Access Control&lt;/A&gt; (FMAC). The press release for the project is available &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-03/sunflash.20080313.1.xml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;What&apos;s Flexible Mandatory Access Control (FMAC)?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a mechanism generally implemented in the operating system that provides unbypassable restrictions over system privileges. MAC&apos;s exists so that not just anyone, for example, can look at your passport file without permission, or turn off a machine in mission critical deployment. MAC is all about managing privileges.

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.avon-barrier.co.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.avon-barrier.co.uk/images/rb880r5.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
But when it comes to MAC, there isn&apos;t one size that fits all, so that&apos;s where the flexible part comes in. An installation&apos;s security goals can vary
based upon the value of its information assets or systems, and the methods used to protect them. By allowing flexibility, the security policy can be
described to meet the actual needs for access control based upon an extensible enforcement model. 
&lt;P&gt;
Thus, &lt;em&gt;Flexible&lt;/em&gt; Mandatory Access Controls - you can read more about FMAC &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensolaris.org/os/project/fmac/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. FMAC isn&apos;t just a government issue, of course, it&apos;s just as much an issue for a social networking site, or a bank - everyone wants simplified, easy to use access controls, consumers and corporations, too.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Who&apos;s involved in the project?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sun and the NSA are jointly working in the OpenSolaris community, and we&apos;re inviting broad participation - one of the great benefits of being an open source company is that Sun can innovate out in the open, within a very large community. For security technologies in particular, transparency of development is absolutely vital, even for the NSA - you can&apos;t sneak trojan horses into open source platforms. So open source allows high security customers to trust vendors *and* verify. 
&lt;P&gt;
This collaboration is a great endorsement for the integrity of the OpenSolaris community among government users focused on technical and commercial progress.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;So why did the NSA select Sun?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Security and performance are really the core of our relationship with governments around the world. We&apos;ve been focused on security since our inception, and we&apos;ve got more than 20 years experience in the trusted operating system business (remember, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Solaris&quot;&gt;Trusted Solaris&lt;/A&gt; spawned from collaboration with the US government about a decade ago). 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.ukfreesims.co.uk/img/simcards1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Our security technologies touch everything from the SIM card in your cell phone, to the identity management platforms at the heart of some of the world&apos;s largest web services - and Solaris has long been recognized as the most secure open source OS in deployment, from battlefields to command and control systems. So this seemed like a natural partnership to us.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;You mentioned something about integrating NSA security research?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, we are investigating how the NSA research on Flux Advanced Security Kernel (&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/fluke/html/flask.html&quot;&gt;FLASK&lt;/A&gt;) architecture and type enforcement (TE) policy can be
combined with our Solaris Trusted Extensions technology. They&apos;re potentially complementary, and we think we can leverage that in the delivery of a fully open source application stack - from &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysql.com&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/A&gt; through &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://glassfish.java.net&quot;&gt;Glassfish/Java&lt;/A&gt;, and up to the user. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 32px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/opensolaris_little.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;


&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/downloads&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 30px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;a HREF=&quot;https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/v2ur1-b09d.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:center margin:0px 10px 0px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;https://glassfish-theme.dev.java.net/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/index.php&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;margin: 24px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 130px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.netbeans.org/images/v5/nb-logo2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
The Flask architecture separates policy enforcement from the policy itself. Policies can be modified without needing to change the enforcement &quot;hooks&quot; in the operating environment, which makes life a lot easier for security administrators, and makes the systems more flexible and useful.
&lt;P&gt;
Type Enforcement policy allows for very fine-grained access control that can be used to to protect against malicious software.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Why are we embarking on this work with the NSA?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We&apos;ve received requests for a Flask/TE based implementation in Solaris from a number of government customers. And now that we have Solaris Trusted Extensions out the door, it&apos;s a great time to start looking toward the future. We already have a great Multilevel Security (MLS) infrastructure with Solaris Trusted Extensions but the value of the combined technologies may provide a single extensible platform that can be used to protect sensitive government information, along with mainstream enterprises, and ultimately, even consumer electronics like your phone or digital video recorder.
&lt;P&gt;


&lt;B&gt;What audience does FMAC address?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Like I said above, MAC based systems are used primarily by governments. Our goal moving forward is to make technologies such as FMAC more accessible to commercial markets, from startups to big enterprises. Governments tend to be good leading indicators for broader commercial security concerns.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.ego4u.com/images/countries/uk/london/houses-of-parliament01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

High security used to be esoteric, now it&apos;s essential - for the US government, for international governments, and most importantly, for users.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Is this limited to the US?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Nope. It&apos;s an OpenSolaris project and we want the global community to help drive it forward. If others want to collaborate, just create an account on opensolaris.org and join in. 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;B&gt;If someone wants to get a hold of your team to talk about FMAC in the open source community, what should they do?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Just send me an email, bill.vass@sun.com. We&apos;ve got lots of folks in Washington, DC, as well as contacts around the world, who can help organizations understand security and open source, and understand how to join the community to collaborate around security innovation. Now&apos;s the time, join in!
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks, Bill. Much appreciated.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You&apos;re very welcome. &lt;B&gt;ADDITION&lt;/B&gt;: if any of your readers are local to Silicon Valley, and would like to hear Sun&apos;s lead John Weeks discuss Flask/TE and the OpenSolaris collaboration project, you might &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/aland/date/20080325&quot;&gt;stop in on us&lt;/A&gt; in at Sun&apos;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=sun+santa+clara+campus&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl&quot;&gt;Santa Clara campus&lt;/A&gt; at 7:30p. If not, I&apos;ll post a video of the session so interested parties can share their insights.

        <content type="html">I had no idea the Hubble telescope could see only 12 billion years into the past. 
&lt;P&gt;


&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/gallery/db/spacecraft/06/formats/06_sm_web.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;



Frankly, I&apos;d never really thought about telescopes looking into the past until &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ucsd.tv/atoms/meet-norman.shtml&quot;&gt;Dr. Michael Norman&lt;/A&gt;, a researcher from &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sdsc.edu/&quot;&gt;UCSD&lt;/A&gt; gave me a basic education in astronomy - and explained the Hubble looks at celestial bodies whose light is just now reaching us. But it can &quot;only&quot; see 12 billion years into the past - and that was a veil he&apos;d like to pierce. (I asked him what he did for a living, he said, &quot;I simulate the universe.&quot; Trump that job description.)
&lt;P&gt;
The question he was interested in answering was, &quot;what about the prior 1.7 billion years?&quot; The universe is roughly 13.7 billion years old, and given the Hubble&apos;s limits, he was using the world&apos;s largest supercomputer, the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/ta/ta_display.php?ta_id=100379&quot;&gt;Ranger&lt;/A&gt; platform at the University of Texas at Austin&apos;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/&quot;&gt;TACC&lt;/A&gt; (Texas Advanced Computer Center) to &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://lca.ucsd.edu/portal/software/zeus-mp2/?searchterm=None&quot;&gt;simulate&lt;/A&gt; the prior 1.7 billion years. (He later confided he was most interested in the prior 1.5 billion years, the first 200-300 million were characterized by lots of hydrogen fog, yet to clump into the wells that enable stars to be born.) 
&lt;P&gt;
I was asked to give a keynote to celebrate Ranger&apos;s opening, and this was only one example of the flood of basic research and science that will now be performed on the world&apos;s largest open computing platform. Open? The facility was funded by the National Science Foundation, and is committed to providing large scale supercomputing as a service to any researcher or scientist within the US (&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.teragrid.org/userinfo/access/allocations.php&quot;&gt;submit proposals here&lt;/a&gt;). Ranger is built entirely on Sun - to dip into geekspeak for a moment, here are the stats: 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_&apos;em_Horns&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin: 5px 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 2-200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/horns.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;&lt;small&gt;

&lt;li type=square&gt;In around 6,000 square feet datacenter space, consuming less than 3 Megawatts...
&lt;li type=square&gt;More than 4000 quad core Sun/Opteron blades, 120+ Tb of DRAM, running CentOS
&lt;li type=square&gt;Delivering more than 500 teraflops computing capacity
&lt;li type=square&gt;Jobs scheduled by Sun&apos;s Grid Engine
&lt;li type=square&gt;Interconnected by two, 100 terabit non-blocking Magnum switches (horns optional)
&lt;li type=square&gt;Data managed by the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php?title=Main_Page&quot;&gt; Lustre file system&lt;/A&gt;, on Thumpers
&lt;li type=square&gt;More than 2 petabytes of storage
&lt;li type=square&gt;Managed by our hierarchical data management SAM-FS product, archived to Sun tape platforms
&lt;li type=square&gt;With overall systems managed and monitored by xVM OpsCenter (the world&apos;s largest installation).

&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;P&gt;


An enormous amount of engineering went into the construction of the facility and the technology behind it, which Sun can now replicate across the world in smaller (and larger, of course) installations (public and commercial). Beyond governments and research facilities, Industries across the planet are turning to high performance computing for business advantage, not simply scientific endeavor. This system consumes a fraction of the power budget required just a few years ago - making it among the greenest supercomputing facilities on earth, too.
&lt;P&gt;
To give you a sense of how significant Ranger actually is, check out this chart (click for live version):
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;https://portal.teragrid.org:443/gridsphere/gridsphere;jsessionid=D0F5193FBF703D31105219615D07BAA4.tgup1?cid=32&amp;JavaScript=enabled&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/ranger.jpg
&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ranger&apos;s capacity exceeds that of all other National Science Foundation granted supercomputing facilities combined. &lt;/b&gt;When they say big in Texas, they mean big.
&lt;P&gt;
As the director of Cyberinfrastructure at the NSF pointed out during his congratulatory speech, computational simulation is now considered a legitimate field of scientific exploration. From drug discovery to climate modeling, fluid dynamics to simulating the universe, epidemiology to materials science - a facility of this size will revolutionize science, in the US and across the world. To date, there are already more than 500 research projects using Ranger - it&apos;s already changing the world. And because it&apos;s part of the NSF &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.teragrid.org/&quot;&gt;Teragrid&lt;/A&gt;, output from the studies will be shared throughout the world. Open means open. &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/general/staff/boisseau/&quot;&gt;Jay Boisseau&lt;/A&gt;, TACC&apos;s director, let me know they&apos;re dangerously close to receiving more applications for time on Ranger (they have about 500 million cpu hours to allocate each year, or 125m/quarter) than they have available. For folks like Jay and Dr.Norman, increasing capacity &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; appetite - unlike much of enterprise computing, where surpluses are often consolidated away (the heart of Greg&apos;s &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift_(theory)&quot;&gt;redshift theory&lt;/A&gt;).
&lt;P&gt;
How did Ranger come together? It resulted from a commitment to basic science from the National Science Foundation, a passionate set of people at the University of Texas, inspired by a driven technical leader in Jay, commitments from an exceptional (truly exceptional) team of TACC, Sun and AMD employees, with all three groups in a mad scramble to stand up the facility in record time - as the world&apos;s largest open supercomputing facility. The world&apos;s largest, by a factor of 4.
&lt;P&gt;
Ranger will transform academia, industry and ultimately society. Why do I believe that? 
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.niagarafrontier.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 250px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.niagarafrontier.com/image/PLopcgenerators1912.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

As I pointed out during my speech, there was a point at which the Niagara Falls power plant in the United States supplied fully 30% of America&apos;s electrical requirements. The engineering and basic science that went into that work parallels the work required to build Ranger. It was truly fundamental research.
&lt;P&gt;
Did electricity transform society? Unquestionably. Will knowing what happened in the first 1.7 billion years of the universe transform our lives? We don&apos;t know yet. That&apos;s what Dr. Norman is figuring out. A question Sun, AMD and the University of Texas researcher will now be able to help him answer. With a platform Sun will now be making &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/servers/hpc/sunconstellationsystem/index.jsp&quot;&gt;generally available&lt;/A&gt; to the commercial market. (I was going to write something like &quot;parting the clouds of cloud computing,&quot; but even I winced when I read that.)

Today, Sun announced we&apos;ve closed the acquisition of MySQL - MySQL is now officially a part of Sun! From a dinner meeting back in late November, through some &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/23603&quot;&gt;introspection&lt;/A&gt; from MySQL&apos;s CEO, to a closing today in late February - everyone involved showed a great sense of pace, urgency and excitement. And now, it&apos;s off to the races!
&lt;P&gt;
Since the announcement, I&apos;ve seen and heard near universal support for the relationship - most everyone wants to know where we&apos;re headed, so here&apos;s a quick overview of our initial plans.
&lt;P&gt;
Starting today, we&apos;re rolling out global programs to raise awareness and adoption of MySQL among more established enterprises - you&apos;ll see ads like this (to the right) targeting institutions and independent software/service vendors (ISV&apos;s) looking to standardize on open source architectures. As the ad highlights, we&apos;re introducing global, enterprise support programs for MySQL - offering the largest institutions on earth a new option in mission critical deployment. We are going all out to sign up new customers, extending MySQL&apos;s reach.
&lt;P&gt;
The overall message is simple: we&apos;re bringing our largest customers the innovation and performance the world&apos;s most important on-line companies are already experiencing - giving them the option of putting MySQL into global, mission critical deployment.
&lt;P&gt;
Internally, the more than 10,000 people that make up the Sun engineering community - of which the MySQL team is now a core part - have begun to engage across a dizzying array of touchpoints. From diagnostics and &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/ritu/entry/how_to_configure_mysql_to&quot;&gt;technical integration&lt;/A&gt;, to performance engineering, hardware and software optimization and, leveraging our large scale benchmarking facilities, going after a few more world records. A breadth of projects are underway to enhance the value MySQL can deliver in a diversity of settings - and we&apos;ll work hard to ensure MySQL flies like a dolphin on Linux, Windows and Solaris, and on systems built by Dell, IBM, HP, Intel, AMD, Sun, Fujitsu (ie, everyone).
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Sakila.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
As importantly, our market development teams are also spooling up - to assist ISV&apos;s who rely upon MySQL (along with those that are newly interested in doing so) with the engineering, marketing and sales support they require. Functionality aside, what matters most to ISV&apos;s is ready access to markets and customers - what&apos;s known as &quot;go to market&quot; partnering with ISV&apos;s has always been a long suit for Sun. So over the next few months, you&apos;ll start to see a parade of new wins - which we&apos;ll be winning with ISV&apos;s, and with partners, arm in arm, across the world.
&lt;P&gt;
The big MySQL user conference is coming up, too - to which I&apos;d like to invite all interested in the future of MySQL (partners, ISV&apos;s, customers, developers, all). You can get &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysqlconf.com&quot;&gt;more information here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;
Now,  although the feedback has been hugely positive, across the globe, there have been a couple snarky comments from a cynic here and there, whose concerns I thought I&apos;d put to rest right here, once and for all.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/vanga/entry/scaling_sugarcrm_with_mysql_on&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/images/SugarCRM_logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
There are still folks in the world who don&apos;t believe there&apos;s an economic model behind open source - they thus believe $1 billion is an outlandish price to pay for MySQL. The most extreme among them see Linux, OpenSolaris or companies like &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/vanga/entry/scaling_sugarcrm_with_mysql_on&quot;&gt;SugarCRM&lt;/A&gt; as nothing more than playgrounds for hobbyists.
&lt;P&gt;
Most of the IT world knows quite the opposite.
&lt;P&gt;
Companies that &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free&quot;&gt;freely&lt;/A&gt; distribute their products, rather than limit access via pricing or proprietary licensing, are simply prioritizing adoption over immediate revenue - a good example of this is Microsoft&apos;s recent attempt to revive adoption of their developer tools in universities by lowering some prices to free. 
&lt;P&gt;
There is a clear economic model behind open source, eloquently summarized by Marten Mickos, MySQL&apos;s CEO: the spectrum describing the marketplace spans those with more time than money, who form the user and developer communities around free software; and those with more money than time, who purchase commercial support contracts typically in more mature enterprises. To win in the long run, you have to win on both sides of the spectrum - with the same product. Crippling products, or sneaky licensing exceptions don&apos;t work - freedom does.
&lt;P&gt;
In terms of the price we paid for MySQL (roughly $800m in cash, $200m in assumed options), we thought about it this way - first, the standalone business, unenhanced by Sun, was on a ramp to an IPO. The IPO would&apos;ve been priced, by our calculations, at near the purchase price we paid. Remember, we&apos;re buying a financial asset as well as a strategic one. We paid a control premium to convince their board to go with Sun, obviously. But then we figured we could amplify their success as a software company by aligning with Sun&apos;s 17,000+ person global sales/service/support/channel organization - we can together reach a far broader customer set than MySQL could on their own, which generates upside for Sun. And, although a small (but growing) percentage of their downloads convert to purchase orders, 100% of those downloads require a hardware purchase - for many, a server and storage device (for just as many, a laptop). We&apos;d like to believe we can earn some of that business with solutions optimized for MySQL - even if the end customer isn&apos;t (yet) paying for software.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin: -10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 280px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/sun_mysql_mug_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Finally, remember that database licenses often make up a considerable part of any company&apos;s budget - to the extent we can introduce new options for those customers (even via the appearance of a well designed coffee mug on the procurement agent&apos;s desk), we can free up budgets for new investments. Which drives more customers to seek out Sun - vendors that save money with better performance are well liked.
&lt;P&gt;
Net/net, we believe we paid a fair price (and all that said, remember, we&apos;re not a monopsony).
&lt;P&gt;
Now, another concern forwarded to me was the conspiracy theory that wondered... as soon as a big company owns MySQL, surely they&apos;ll adopt a nefarious proprietary license that levies extortionate rents for the simple act of storing and retrieving data?
&lt;P&gt;
Anyone who thinks that hasn&apos;t be following &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/16/sun_mysql_open_source/&quot;&gt;Sun of late&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
One reason the integration of Sun and MySQL has gone so smoothly is our development and business models are nearly identical - we both invest in very high quality free software and the cultivation of large communities, then turn our efforts to monetize at the point of value for companies that want commercial support. We&apos;re peas in a pod.
&lt;P&gt;
And to prove the point - I would like to formally invite you to try MySQL, with a free download (just click the logo). While you&apos;re at it, why not give Glassfish and NetBeans a swim around the tank, too...  Web developers never had it so good...
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/downloads&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 30px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
It&apos;s truly a great day for free software - and for the growing majority of companies across the globe that look to open solutions for choice, value and innovation.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I hope to see many of you at the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysqlconf.com&quot;&gt;MySQL Conference&lt;/A&gt;! I&apos;m quite confident it&apos;s going to be an interesting event for everyone.

        <content type="html">As you&apos;re probably aware, we&apos;ve been working very hard to rebuild the community, and the momentum, around all our software assets at Sun, most notably the Solaris operating system. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.tedpella.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.tedpella.com/magnify_html/7401.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Why notably Solaris? As a systems company, the operating system (OS) is among the most important lenses through which our microelectronics, software, systems and service innovations are seen by the marketplace - if the lens is cloudy, you can&apos;t see much. As is the case with few other products, our overall market is defined by how big a community of skills, applications and developers we can build around Solaris (and its younger sibling, OpenSolaris) - and only then, by how many customers we can generate.
&lt;P&gt;
The work to rebuild that developer community was begun in earnest in January of 2005 - the date on which we made the first source code to Solaris available under a &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;free software&lt;/A&gt; license. But the investment in innovation (the main reason people care about source code, after all) &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/business/03unbox.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;began far earlier&lt;/A&gt;, with projects like &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/faq/&quot;&gt;ZFS&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/&quot;&gt;DTrace&lt;/A&gt; beginning about seven (yes, &lt;b&gt;seven&lt;/b&gt;) years ago. Other enhancements were more recent - like our embrace of the

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/software/products/postgresql/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 75px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://pkg-vexim.alioth.debian.org/img/postgresql.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;


 Postgres community (who delivered a &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.872&quot;&gt;fantastic new 8.3 release&lt;/A&gt; into OpenSolaris today), the evolution of &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://glassfish.java.net&quot;&gt;Glassfish&lt;/A&gt; (which has a similarly long history), and even the inclusion of &lt;A HREF =&quot;http://opensolaris.org/os/project/cifs-server/&quot;&gt;CIFS&lt;/A&gt; (which allows Solaris to be a first class file server for Microsoft Windows machines).
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://glassfish.java.net&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;https://glassfish-theme.dev.java.net/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
The developer community surrounding Solaris - as opposed to the user community - is best measured by OpenSolaris. Like its brethren in the Linux community, OpenSolaris is always the most up to date release of Solaris innovations, and is used by those who not only tolerate changes to the underlying OS, but eagerly anticipate it in hopes of eeking out incremental performance, features or functions.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.forrester.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/forrester-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Which is why I was so thrilled to read a report from Forrester that showed great progress in Europe - for open source broadly, and for Solaris and OpenSolaris specifically. You can read &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/analyst/european_fsa.pdf&quot;&gt;the report here&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
In it, executives in European Financial Services companies point to Solaris as one of the three most important OS&apos;s for their business - and the only modern/open source OS (the other two are proprietary). This bodes well for our capacity to grow, and the early return on what&apos;s been a long innovation cycle, not solely in features and performance, but in community, too. (I doubt OpenSolaris was even measurable last year.)
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/images/solaris_medium.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

But what&apos;s really the best part about the report?
&lt;P&gt;
It represents data as of nearly a year ago. If two points make a trend...
&lt;P&gt;
To the teams involved - inside Sun, and in the community... thank you. Your work is making a measurable difference.

&lt;P&gt;



We released our official earnings on Thursday last week, after pre-announcing the news one week prior alongside the announcement of our &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/winds_of_change_are_blowing&quot;&gt;intent to acquire MySQL&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 20px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 50px;&quot; SRC=&quot;http://logos.sun.com/try/img/sun_logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Our second quarter financial &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/investor/earnings_releases/pr/fy08q2/index.html&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/A&gt; came down to this: we doubled our profitability compared to a year ago, with $260 million in net income on revenues of $3.6 billion, while generating $336 million in cash from operations. We also repurchased $750 million of our own shares within the quarter, and reaffirmed our guidance for the full year of low to mid single digit revenue growth, and at least 8% operating profit for Q4 (excluding any acquisition charges). 
&lt;P&gt;
From a financial perspective, with the glass half empty, total revenues were up only slightly (just over 1% vs. a year ago). This was partly due to changes in how we do business with our resellers and channel partners &#8211; we&apos;ll be reporting revenue when there&apos;s a sale to an end user customer, not when we&apos;ve fulfilled an order from a business partner that sells to end users. (This makes us more transparent, too.)
&lt;P&gt;
Those changes took a few percentage points of revenue growth off the top line, and were one reason for the disparity between our bookings growth of 7%+ (bookings are orders for delivery within the next six months) and our revenue (orders fulfilled/installed within the quarter). With the glass half full, this generated a very healthy &#8220;book to bill&#8221; ratio, which investors look to for insight into future performance. Our total deferred revenues (products and services) also ballooned considerably, growing 24% year over year, to almost $2.7 billion. A very healthy increase.
&lt;P&gt;
What were some of the strategic highlights within the quarter? 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Topping the list was the interest in &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://opensolaris.org/os/community/xen/docs/developers/&quot;&gt;Sun xVM&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. xVM is our free, open source virtualization platform, which we unveiled at Oracle Open World, alongside our management platform, xVM Ops Center. xVM will virtualize Windows, Linux or Solaris, on either Dell, HP, IBM or Sun hardware. We&apos;ve seen broad interest from across the world, especially from customers that want to avoid putting a proprietary virtualization technology at the base of large scale open source datacenters (&#8220;why go back?&#8221; one said to me). Interest in &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2007-1114/feature/index.jsp&quot;&gt;our virtualization story&lt;/A&gt; (from xVM to Solaris containers) expands to every industry, and nearly every customer &#8211; it&apos;s just about the number one item on the agenda.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.dell.com/solaris&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 80px;&quot; SRC=&quot;http://i.dell.com/images/global/brand/ui/logo52.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Next on the list was &lt;b&gt;signing a Solaris OEM deal with Dell&lt;/b&gt;, through which they&apos;ve endorsed and will support Solaris across their server and blade platforms. This was a very big deal for us &#8211;  an endorsement from the volume leader in PC&apos;s and commodity infrastructure matters to our customers. Michael joined me on stage, and politely invited me to join Dell&apos;s &#8220;Regeneration&#8221; (an offer I gladly accepted in exchange for a t-shirt). Dell joins IBM and &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://softwareblogs.intel.com/2008/01/22/intel-sun-1-year-opensolaris/&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; as Solaris OEM partners. Personally, I&apos;d love to add Hewlett Packard to the list of partners our customers can rely upon for Solaris support.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We saw double digit growth in emerging economies&lt;/b&gt;, from India, China, Latin America, to portions of Eastern Europe and the Middle East. We saw booming growth in our UltraSPARC T2 Niagara platform, generating approximately $285 million in billings, 100% higher than a year ago. 100% growth! Why&apos;s it growing so fast? A focus on eco-efficiency, on outright raw performance, integrated (ie., free) virtualization and crypto support - we see opportunity emerging every day. With the acceptance of SPARC and Solaris 10 as open platforms driving new conversations and opportunity (with our existing, and new customers - if you&apos;d like to try a Niagara 2 (officially, a T5120 or T5220) system for free, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/tryandbuy/products.jsp&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt;).
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Our x64 business was relatively flat within the quarter&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; which was a low point, certainly. But we&apos;re just now introducing our new Intel offerings, and starting to build out our blade offerings. So I&apos;ve got more confidence heading into the back half of the year, and with a bulked up product line that continues to expand and evolve.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.fujitsu.com/img/common/fujitsu/en/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/servers/highend/m9000/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.sun.com/images/k3/k3_enterprise-m9000_3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

&lt;b&gt;We also saw growth on the very highest end systems we jointly build with Fujitsu&lt;/b&gt;. We&apos;re seeing those systems perform at or above our internal benchmark estimates, and we couldn&apos;t be happier with the strategic progress Sun and Fujitsu are making as partners. Speaking of partner relationships, we saw good growth in our Hitachi high end storage offerings, alongside growth in our core tape business. As predicted, we&apos;re seeing growing interest in tape as an archive platform among web companies that must preserve very large pools of data (user generated photographs and movies, eg.) for long periods of time. Where &#8220;large pools&#8221; are tens of petabytes, growing to hundreds). Alongside growth in our enterprise business, we also saw good growth from our Services business.
&lt;P&gt;
What&apos;s my view on the economy? Having spent my undergraduate years studying the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismal_Science&quot;&gt;dismal science&lt;/a&gt;, I can say with complete confidence, &#8220;no one knows with certainty.&#8221; What do I hear from customers? That they&apos;re increasingly turning to technology to drive efficiency, automation, and growth. And we&apos;re a central figure in that conversation, far more central than a year ago. 
&lt;P&gt;
In addition, we just held an event with 150 or so of our business partners from across the world &#8211; evenly split across Europe, the Americas and the Asia Pacific region. And what did I hear from those partners? That&apos;s confidential, of course, but there&apos;s a reason we&apos;re all holding champagne glasses. We&apos;re hoping to make a habit of toasting success.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;IMG SRC = &quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/americas.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC = &quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/emea.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;P&gt;
To the partners that joined us at the event - &lt;b&gt;thank you for the partnership&lt;/b&gt;. We are committed to growing our opportunity, and the value of our relationships. There&apos;s a world of opportunity in front of us, and we&apos;re looking forward to capturing it together.

In a vortex. That&apos;s the only way to describe the past thirty days, during which we closed out our second quarter, and put together the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/winds_of_change_are_blowing&quot;&gt;transaction to acquire MySQL&lt;/A&gt;. How&apos;d it all start? 
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;That&apos;ll never happen, I&apos;ve been trying for years.&quot; That&apos;s what I told Rich Green (EVP, Software at Sun) about six months ago in response to his assertion, &quot;if there were one company I&apos;d love to acquire, it&apos;d be MySQL. They&apos;re an amazing company.&quot; Why&apos;d I say it was impossible? 
&lt;P&gt;
For nearly five years, I&apos;ve been getting together for dinner with Marten Mickos, MySQL&apos;s CEO, catching up on the industry, chatting about trends and business models, and just as the dessert was about to be served... I&apos;d say, &quot;geez, we have so much in common, Marten, we see the world so similarly, what would you think about becoming a part of Sun?&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysql.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 150px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
At which point Marten would say he was flattered and honored, pour some milk into his coffee, stir, and start talking about Finland.
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;I still think it&apos;s worth trying,&quot; said Rich. So we did - Marten, Rich and I set up another dinner for early December. At which we went through the same great conversation, updating one another on what we saw in the market and industry, how much we had common, and just as dessert was showing up, I popped the question. And... 
&lt;P&gt;
...smile, stir, we&apos;re talking about Finland again.
&lt;P&gt;
So we leave the restaurant, talk about scheduling another dinner six months from now, and I look at Rich with the &quot;See what I mean?&quot; look on my face.
&lt;P&gt;
But unlike prior meetings, the next morning, Marten called me back and said, &quot;We&apos;ve been doing some thinking. Are you still interested in talking about an acquisition?&quot; Um, yes. Yes. Just like the past four years.
&lt;P&gt;

And that&apos;s where it all started. 
&lt;P&gt;
Tenacity pays, and Rich joins the growing list of people who can pull an &quot;I told you so&quot; card. (For the record, I&apos;m happily proven wrong, it keeps me on my toes.)
&lt;P&gt;
Other than &quot;how did this deal come to pass?&quot; I&apos;ve heard a lot of questions over the past few days, and thought I&apos;d write down a few answers. 
&lt;P&gt;
First things first. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A billion dollars for a company that gives its products away for free?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Facebook gives its products away for free, too. They make money on ads, we make money on service, support and infrastructure. MySQL has a big business, growing very rapidly. Investing in the future has more value than buying the past - which is why the latter so often comes at a discount. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What happens to your commitment to PostgreSQL?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/software/products/postgresql/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://pkg-vexim.alioth.debian.org/img/postgresql.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

It grows. The day before we announced the acquisition, and within an hour of signing the deal, I put a call into Josh Berkus, who leads our work with Postgres inside of Sun. I wanted to be as clear as I could: this transaction increases our investment in open source, and in open source databases. And increases our commitment to Postgres - and the database industry broadly. The same goes for our work with Apache Derby, and our JavaDB.
&lt;P&gt;
Josh says it exactly right &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/soup/archives/sun-acquires-mysql-21822&quot;&gt;on his blog&lt;/A&gt; - Sun wants to be the leading provider of datacenters. Not just MySQL datacenters. Exactly. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Who are you going to buy next? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Now that&apos;s a great question, we&apos;ll tell you after we&apos;re done :)
&lt;P&gt;
More seriously, I do agree with those that say Sun&apos;s acquisition of MySQL proves the value of open source business models - and I&apos;m hoping it fuels yet more investment from the venture community in truly open source innovation. There is a ton of value to be had, just ask MySQL&apos;s investors.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What happens to your relationship with Oracle?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 90px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://oracleimg.com/admin/images/ocom/hp/oralogo_small.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
Oracle&apos;s a very important Solaris ISV - and we have joint customers across the world that have relied upon the service and support Sun and Oracle provide in mission critical environments to run the world&apos;s banks, retailers, telcos, governments, etc. Absolutely nothing changes about that commitment as a result of this deal - just as nothing changes in our willingness and ability to support DB2, or Microsoft&apos;s SQL Server (which also happens to run quite well on our systems, btw). Customers want choice, and we maintain our commitment to offer it. 
&lt;P&gt;
It&apos;s important to remember, our service organization focuses on our customers, not our products. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Will the integration be complex like StorageTek? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
StorageTek was 7,000 employees, with complicated supply chains, logistics processes, real estate, factories, redundant systems (like any big company), different engineering models and processes built up over a 35 year history. Integration was, to be blunt, complicated.
&lt;P&gt;
MySQL is 400 employees, without offices (their employees work from home), without a supply chain, no factories or real estate, and they have an engineering model and business process just about identical to ours. 
&lt;P&gt;
So no, the integration won&apos;t be complex. It&apos;ll be quite straightforward.
&lt;P&gt;
After the transaction closes, Marten Mickos will continue to lead MySQL, will report into our Software organization, and will join my Executive Management Group (the top officers at Sun). 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://glassfish.java.net&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:0px 10px 0px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 80px;&quot;SRC=&quot;https://glassfish-theme.dev.java.net/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
And strategically, there are technical synergies everywhere we look, as well - from &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-zfs.html&quot;&gt;MySQL on ZFS and Lustre&lt;/A&gt;, to better integration with &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://glassfish.java.net&quot;&gt;Glassfish&lt;/A&gt;, OpenSolaris, NetBeans and our Grid Engine. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Will you change their platform priorities? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Absolutely not.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why not? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Because the L in LAMP stands for Linux, not Looney. Customers prioritize MySQL&apos;s platform choices, not Sun. As with Glassfish, their number one download platform is still Windows - and we&apos;re very committed to those developers, as well.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Will you change MySQL&apos;s choice of license (the GPL)?&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
No. As you can see with Java, and with Glassfish (and NetBeans and OpenOffice), we&apos;re huge supporters of the GPL.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Are there cost synergies in the deal? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Nope. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Are there revenue synergies in the deal? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Everywhere we look.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Where are the revenue synergies?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
The more interesting question is &quot;where aren&apos;t the synergies?&quot; Wherever MySQL is deployed, &lt;em&gt;whether the user is paying for software support or not&lt;/em&gt;, a server will be purchased, along with a storage device, networking infrastructure - and over time, support services on high value open platforms. Last I checked, we have products in almost all those categories.
&lt;P&gt;
In addition, the single biggest impediment to MySQL&apos;s growth wasn&apos;t the feature set of their technology - which is perfectly married to planetary scale in the on-line/web world. The biggest impediment was that some traditional enterprises wanted a Fortune 500 vendor (&quot;someone in a Gartner magic quadrant&quot;) to provide enterprise support. Good news, we can augment MySQL&apos;s great service team with an extraordinary set of service professionals across the planet - and provide global mission critical support to the biggest businesses on earth.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Where will you take MySQL next?&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
That&apos;s a question you&apos;ll need to vector to MySQL - both before the acquisition (given that we&apos;re still separate companies), as well as after. We&apos;re not acquiring them to tell them what to do - we acquiring them to listen. To their leaders, their community, and their customers.
&lt;P&gt;
And having listened to about 10 customers face to face over the past couple days, I&apos;ve heard only one comment, made consistently - &quot;Congratulations, this is absolutely fantastic news for all of us!&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
I totally agree.

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysql.com&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 200px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/MySQL_Logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
We announced big news today - our preliminary results for our fiscal second quarter, and as importantly, that we&apos;re acquiring &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysql.com&quot;&gt;MySQL AB&lt;/A&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;
If you&apos;re interested in the financial details for the quarter, tune in to our conference call (see details on &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com&quot;&gt;sun.com&lt;/A&gt;) today - we&apos;ll obviously have more to say as we release our formal results on January 24th.
&lt;P&gt;
But the biggest news of the day is... &lt;b&gt;we&apos;re putting a billion dollars behind the M in &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29&quot;&gt;LAMP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If you&apos;re an industry insider, you&apos;ll know what that means - we&apos;re acquiring MySQL AB, the company behind MySQL, the world&apos;s most popular open source database.
&lt;P&gt;
You&apos;ll recall I wrote about a customer event a few weeks ago, at which some of the world&apos;s most important web companies talked to us about their technology challenges. Simultaneously, we gathered together some of the largest IT shops and their CIO&apos;s, and spent the same two days (in adjoining rooms) listening to their views and directions.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; width: 250px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Sakila.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Both sets of customers confirmed what we&apos;ve known for years - that MySQL is by far the most popular platform on which modern developers are creating network services. From Facebook, Google and Sina.com to banks and telecommunications companies, architects looking for performance, productivity and innovation have turned to MySQL. In high schools and college campuses, at startups, at high performance computing labs and in the Global 2000. The adoption of MySQL across the globe is nothing short of breathtaking. They are the root stock from which an enormous portion of the web economy springs.
&lt;P&gt;
But as I pointed out, we heard some paradoxical things, too. CTO&apos;s at startups and web companies disallow the usage of products that aren&apos;t free and open source. They need and want access to source code to enable optimization and rapid problem resolution (although they&apos;re happy to pay for support if they see value). Alternatively, more traditional CIO&apos;s disallow the usage of products that aren&apos;t backed by commercial support relationships - they&apos;re more comfortable relying on vendors like Sun to manage global, mission critical infrastructure.
&lt;P&gt;
This puts products like MySQL in an interesting position. They&apos;re a part of every web company&apos;s infrastructure, to be sure. And though many of the more traditional companies use MySQL (from auto companies to financial institutions to banks and retailers), many have been waiting for a Fortune 500 vendor willing to step up, to provide mission critical global support.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sun.com/service/serviceplans/index.jsp&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 260px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/services.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

So what are we announcing today? That in addition to acquiring MySQL, Sun will be unveiling new global support offerings into the MySQL marketplace. We&apos;ll be investing in both the community, and the marketplace - to accelerate the industry&apos;s phase change away from proprietary technology to the new world of open web platforms.
&lt;P&gt;
The good news is Sun is already committed to the business model at the heart of MySQL&apos;s success - first investing to grow communities of users and developers, and only then creating commercial services that attract (rather than lock in) paying customers. Over the past few years, we&apos;ve distributed hundreds of millions of licenses and invested to build some of the free software world&apos;s largest communities. From Java to ZFS, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php?title=Main_Page&quot;&gt;Lustre&lt;/A&gt; to 

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://glassfish.java.net&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;https://glassfish-theme.dev.java.net/logo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

 Glassfish, NetBeans to OpenOffice.org and OpenSolaris, we&apos;ve been patient investors and contributors, both. Free and open software has become a way of life at Sun. MySQL&apos;s has similarly driven extraordinary adoption of their community platform, with more than 100 million downloads over the past 10 years. Their users, as with Sun&apos;s, run MySQL across every major operating system - Linux, Windows, Solaris and the Mac; and every major system platform, from IBM, Intel, AMD, Dell, Sun and HP.
&lt;P&gt;
Not coincidentally, those companies are exactly the companies with whom Sun has signed &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/momentous_day_for_solaris&quot;&gt;OEM relationships&lt;/A&gt; - so the integration of MySQL into Sun&apos;s ecosystem and channels will be exceptionally straightforward.
&lt;P&gt;
So how do we plan to go after this new opportunity? In a few fundamental ways.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; width: 250px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/Marten_et_al.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

We&apos;ve historically worked at arm&apos;s length to optimize MySQL on Sun&apos;s platforms. Just as we did for Oracle in their early days, our performance engineering teams will sit (virtually) with their counterparts in MySQL and in the community, leveraging technologies such as ZFS and DTrace (which we didn&apos;t even have in the Oracle era) to ensure &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://mysql.openmirrors.org/doc/refman/5.1/en/history.html&quot;&gt;Sakila&lt;/A&gt; flies - along with the rest of the LAMP stack (from memcached and php, to the broader ISV community around MySQL). MySQL is already the performance leader on a variety of benchmarks - we&apos;ll make performance leadership the default for every application we can find (and on every vendor&apos;s hardware platforms, not just Sun&apos;s - and on Linux, Solaris, Windows, all). For the technically oriented, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Falcon&quot;&gt;Falcon&lt;/A&gt; will absolutely sing on Niagara... talk about a match made in heaven.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://www.mysql.com/ent-trial-reg-2007/mysql_enterprise-white-med.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Second, I&apos;ve asked our team to negotiate an arms&apos; length commercial transaction, prior to closing, that allows us to provide Global Enterprise Support for MySQL - so that traditional enterprises looking for the same mission critical support they&apos;ve come to expect with proprietary databases can have that peace of mind with MySQL, as well. This gives traditional enterprises a world of new choices and competition. As I said, if there&apos;s one item customers have been asking from us for years it&apos;s more innovation in the database marketplace - we&apos;re now in a position to respond.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px 0px 10px 10px; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/resource/mysql1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

Third, we&apos;ll be announcing some exceptionally attractive platform offerings, leveraging the success Lustre and ZFS, along with new systems platforms (like the new 48TB Thumpers and 64 thread Niagara2 machines) to deliver eye popping price performance. Ultimately, that&apos;s what customers want - real value, supported globally, with quality and performance. Most importantly, MySQL&apos;s partners are going to be the centerpiece of our solutions and offers - just as we&apos;ve done with Solaris and Java, we&apos;re going to work very hard to make our ISV&apos;s wildly successful as we broaden the market. It takes decades to build a broad partner portfolio, and they are an enormous part of the value customers see in Sun, and we certainly see in MySQL.
&lt;P&gt;
And finally, this acquisition will kickstart a new set of investments Sun will be making into the academic community. Why universities? As we continue to invest in open source software development across the world, it&apos;s apparent that nearly all roads lead to academic environments - and it&apos;s high time we (as an industry) started watering the trees at their roots. It&apos;s one thing to say you&apos;re committed to education, it&apos;s another to put your money where your mouth is. Within the next 60 days, Greg will be announcing a new set of global research fellowships designed to advance the state of engineering on the internet. (Stay tuned on this blog, and on Greg&apos;s, for updates.) 
&lt;P&gt;
So why is this important for the internet? Until now, no platform vendor has assembled all the core elements of a completely open source operating system for the internet. No company has been able to deliver a comprehensive alternative to the leading proprietary OS. With this acquisition, we will have done just that - positioned Sun at the center of the web, as the definitive provider of high performance platforms for the web economy. For startups and web 2.0 companies, to government agencies and traditional enterprises. This creates enormous potential for Sun, for the global free software community, and for our partners and customers across the globe. There&apos;s opportunity everywhere.
&lt;P&gt;
To the folks at MySQL, from employees to customers and partners - welcome, and we&apos;re thrilled to join you. This acquisition spells the beginning of a new era on the internet. 
&lt;P&gt;
Starting with the letter M.

        <content type="html">I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to a very important group of people working through the evenings and holidays - our employees, partners and customers. You know who you are.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070514.wgtapril0514/BNStory/Technology/&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot;float:left; margin:3.5px 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; width: 100px;&quot;SRC=&quot;http://images.theglobeandmail.com/archives/RTGAM/images/20070514/wgtapril0514/candle_600big.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

For most of us, holidays are a great time to catch up with friends and family. They&apos;re also a time of mad scrambles. As I&apos;m sure isn&apos;t unique to the American tradition, some among us postpone holiday shopping until the very last minute (today, even). Which leads to a late surge in infrastructure requirements from those businesses that continue to bet the world will ever get its shopping act in gear (I&apos;ll take the other side of that bet, any day).
&lt;P&gt;
This leads to a late surge in purchase orders (for the record, we love that part, planned or otherwise), and then a late surge in shipment activities (not all datacenters are near airports, sadly), and then a late surge in installation activity - yielding a lot of travel for those responsible.
&lt;P&gt;
In a perfect world, we&apos;d then be done, and home with friends and family.
&lt;P&gt;
But then it doesn&apos;t end.
&lt;P&gt;
Christmas Day is a day of massively high load for Sun&apos;s customers across the world. This year will undoubtedly set a pile of new records. Millions upon millions of network enabled gifts will be given in December, and a huge chunk will be unwrapped and turned on tomorrow. Digital still and video cameras will start pumping content to photo/video sharing services. Mobile phones will need to be provisioned, and will start downloading and sharing content (on a global basis, the network load from New Year&apos;s Eve &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service&quot;&gt;MMS&lt;/A&gt; messages goes beyond staggering). Set top boxes, networked picture frames, video game consoles, navigation devices, &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.webkinz.com/&quot;&gt;stuffed animals&lt;/A&gt;, sports equipment and automobiles - will all come on-line tomorrow. On the same day. And everyone will (and should) expect flawless service.
&lt;P&gt;
For some of our customers, it&apos;s their single highest load day of the year - and single most valuable opportunity to shape their brands. For Sun and our partners, it&apos;s a day we&apos;re very focused on making successful. So to all of you working over the holidays - thank you. I and my team are aware and appreciative of your efforts, and you are making a big difference. 
&lt;P&gt;
Please take the time to rest when the work is done. Remember, the difference between humans and computers is that our uptime is a function of our downtime.
