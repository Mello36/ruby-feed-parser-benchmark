			<title>Warner Music: Where's The Conversation?</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>

			<description>Last week, we broke the story about a &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081204/1534153023.shtml"&gt;presentation being given&lt;/a&gt; to various universities about a music "tax" plan.  The plan presented wasn't any different from what Jim Griffin (who was hired by Warner to pitch exactly this plan earlier this year) has talked about in the past -- but Warner Music Group was quick to contact us and distance itself from the presentation -- despite the title of the presentation announcing that this was Warner Music Group's plan, and two full slides of "comments from WMG," with one of those slides suggesting people contact Griffin at WMG for more info.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This week, a bunch of news organizations reported on the story -- with some, such as the &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3505/recording-industry-proposes-taxing-students-instead-of-suing-them"&gt;the Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;, just repeating what was already known, while a few added to the story.  Wired &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/12/warner-music-gr.html" target="_new"&gt;discovered that the planned name&lt;/a&gt; of the organization that would handle the "distribution" of funds would be Choruss.  It also found out that EMI and Sony BMG have already signed onto the plan, along with Warner, which initiated it.  Universal Music is the major label that's still holding out.  Apparently independent labels are able to join up, as well, but the terms aren't at all clear yet.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Portfolio stepped up with its own discussion of the topic, highlighting a key point that I made to the Warner Music rep who called me: &lt;a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2008/12/08/warnergriffin-music-tax-needs-public-debate"&gt;this conversation should be public&lt;/a&gt;.  My conversation with Warner Music was off-the-record at their request, but I tried to defend posting the presentation by noting that this information should be discussed among &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the stakeholders, rather than settled in a backroom deal like so many efforts by the recording industry.  Otherwise, the parties that are left out of the discussion (generally, consumers) are going to get screwed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In Jim Griffin's response to my post, he complained that: "At this early stage, many ideas may be discussed and discarded, but efforts to prematurely label or criticize the process only hinder achievement of constructive solutions."  I would say back, that, at this early stage, if ideas are being discussed and discarded, why not bring everyone here into the conversation, so that we don't feel like the fix has been put on us after the "finished product" is finally announced from high atop RIAA-mountain?  We're more than willing to help, right here on Techdirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1955023057.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1955023057.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081208/1955023057&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Dealing Virtual Drugs On The iPhone Seems Unlikely To Get People To Do Real Drugs</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/2243233058.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/2243233058.shtml</guid>
			<description>For many, many, many years there has been a very popular application called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dope_Wars"&gt;Dope Wars&lt;/a&gt;.  I used to have a copy of it on my Palm Pilot a decade ago, and it was a fantastic way to kill time (that and Rally 1000 were great time wasters).  Over the years, Dope Wars has shown up on many different platforms and many different versions.  I just looked around, and it appears there are a variety of downloadable versions, some web-based versions, both a MySpace and Facebook app and many other things.  There have also been a ton of derivative games, some taking the drug theme further, and some changing the theme of the game completely.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That's because, in actuality, Dope Wars has relatively little to do with drugs.  It's really a classic trading game.  You borrow money that you need to pay back (with interest) and then you go buy and sell goods at different location.  The goal is simple: buy low, sell high, don't run into any catastrophe (police) and make back enough to pay back whoever you borrowed the money from.  You could easily apply that to any sort of "commodity" -- and I've seen versions based on stock trading, middle ages commodity trading, space travel and a few other such things.  The "drug" connection is pretty weak, and basically just gives a framework for what it is you're buying and selling.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Either way, back when I had that Palm Pilot, I played the game for many, many hours, and never had the slightest interest in following that up by taking or dealing any drugs.  If someone's going to get interested in drugs, it's not going to be from playing such a game... but that hasn't stopped one woman from &lt;a href="http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/12/08/heroin-victim039s-mom-wants-iphone-drug-dealing-game-banned" target="_new"&gt;demanding that a version of the game created for the iPhone, called &lt;i&gt;Underworld&lt;/i&gt;, be banned&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, the woman's situation is tragic.  She has a daughter who fell into a coma after taking heroin.  That's clearly an awful situation.  But it's difficult to think that the reason she took heroin was because she played a dopey trading game on a mobile phone somewhere.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, why target just this iPhone version?  This game, in some form or another, is found on pretty much every platform around (including TI calculators), often with multiple versions from different programmers -- and we've yet to see any evidence that playing the game leads anyone to be even slightly more disposed to taking drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/2243233058.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/2243233058.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081208/2243233058&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>New Zealand Hairdresser Gets Bill For Playing Music In Her Shop</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1817143044.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1817143044.shtml</guid>
			<description>For years, we've questioned why it makes sense for various songwriters' collection societies to charge a license fee for playing music in various restaurants and shops.  In the past, most of the focus on enforcement has been in restaurants and bars, where music is more central to the experience -- but even then, it's always seemed like the music helps draw more interest in people going out and actually paying that musician for something.  It's promotional.  However, in the past few years, collections groups have become a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; more aggressive.  From going after &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071005/094552.shtml"&gt;auto repair shops&lt;/a&gt; because their mechanics listened to radios in the garage that customers could hear in the waiting room (public performance!) to &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080612/1158191390.shtml"&gt;police stations&lt;/a&gt; where cops listened to music too loud (public performance!), these rights societies consistently seem to be shooting themselves in their collective feet.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The latest, sent in by Lawrence D'Oliveiro, involves a &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4782110a22381.html" target="_new"&gt;hairdresser in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; who had the temerity to have a radio playing in her shop (public performance!).  Of course, the real solution to this isn't to pay, but to stop playing music.  Music is not central to the hairdressing process, though, by not playing music, the shop would certainly seem a lot less welcoming.  Either way, the whole thing seems backwards.  If they're playing the music off the radio, then it's been licensed already, and if it's off a personal CD or MP3 player, it's been paid for in other ways.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're still waiting for the day when one of these collections societies goes after someone playing music in their car with the top or windows down (public performance!) or maybe someone on a beach with a radio (public performance!).  Perhaps what they really want is for everyone to do everything with their own personal music players and earphones jacked in.  There should be no sharing or promoting of music whatsoever without a special license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1817143044.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1817143044.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/1817143044&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>PlayStation Hurts Ronaldinho's Performance Once More</title>
			<dc:creator>Carlo Longino</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1903573013.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1903573013.shtml</guid>
			<description>During the 2006 World Cup, Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho made some headlines after his poor performance in the quarterfinal, when Brazil lost to France, was blamed on all-night sessions of &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20060725/1653232.shtml"&gt;sex and PS2 games&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly his game of choice was EA Sports' &lt;i&gt;FIFA 2006&lt;/i&gt; soccer game, so it's slightly amusing to see an opposing goalkeeper credit a save he made on a Ronaldinho free kick last weekend to &lt;a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/743/palermo/2008/12/01/990135/amelia-credits-playstation-for-helping-him-stop-ronaldinho"&gt;playing soccer games on his PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;. The goalie says that the game features a solid replication of Ronaldinho's penalty-taking style, giving him an idea of how to react in real life. As games become more and more realistic, more and more athletes and teams might start using them as &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050523/1921205.shtml"&gt;scouting&lt;/a&gt; tools. Indeed, another soccer team recently signed a deal with the developer of a management simulation game to get &lt;a href="http://kotaku.com/5087283/everton-fc-using-football-manager-2009-to-find-talent"&gt;exclusive access to its full database&lt;/a&gt; in order to help it identify new talent from around the world.&lt;p style="border-top: 1px #aaaaaa dashed;padding-top: 5px;margin-top: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carlo Longino is an expert at the &lt;a href="http://www.insightcommunity.com/"&gt;Insight Community&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Is Emailing Professors About School Schedule Changes Spam?</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1933013048.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1933013048.shtml</guid>
			<description>One of the biggest problems with any kind of regulations concerning "spam" is that people define it very differently -- with the core definition tending to be &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20030829/1329259.shtml"&gt;"anything I don't like"&lt;/a&gt; which is rather difficult to reduce into written regulation.  That problem seems to be cropping up at Michigan State, where a student is being disciplined for &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10114646-38.html?part=rss&amp;#038;subj=news&amp;#038;tag=2547-1_3-0-20" target="_new"&gt;spamming the faculty&lt;/a&gt;.  The student was upset about a plan to shorten the 2009 fall semester, and sent emails to 391 faculty members, alerting them to the planned change, and pointing out how it could impact their syllabi and schedules.  Apparently one out of the 391 professors complained about this as spam, and the school notes that its rules say email to more than 30 people is considered spam (the &lt;a href="http://lct.msu.edu/guidelines-policies/bulkemail.html"&gt;actual policy&lt;/a&gt; seems to leave some wiggle room, but not much).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While you could see how professors would get annoyed if they were constantly bombarded by students supporting different causes asking for help, it's still difficult to see how this particular use of the email system really counts as spam.  Some are pointing out that, since Michigan State is a public university, it needs to protect students' free speech rights -- and disciplining this student goes against those rights.  Overall, the fear should be that this sort of disciplinary process acts as a hindrance to public participation among students.  If actually trying to get out the word on an issue, by sending emails to the folks who are impacted, is likely to get them disciplined, then won't people start to think twice before even bothering?  Is that the message Michigan State is trying to send to its students?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1933013048.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1933013048.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/1933013048&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>What About Free CDs?</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1843393045.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1843393045.shtml</guid>
			<description>&lt;a href="http://www.nodooragency.com"&gt;Don Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;, a manager for some musicians, has written in to point out a letter that he wrote to Bob Lefsetz outlining the &lt;a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2008/11/21/e-mail-of-the-day-13/" target="_new"&gt;successful strategy he's had in promoting one of his acts&lt;/a&gt; and asked for the thoughts of folks around here:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
We decided to put an offer up on Joe's website and MySpace.  We told any fan that if they knew anyone who might be interested in Joe's music that they could send us an email and we send them as many copies of a two-song sampler CD as they wanted.  Free.  We even cover the postage.  To keep costs down, we invested in a cd publishing system that burns and prints them robotically.  Each CD has two songs, contact info, MySpace, and a reminder that the full cd was at iTunes.  If someone lived near a place where a show was scheduled, we printed that show info on there as well.  People requested as few as 2 and as many as 50.  We sent all of them. Requests continued to pour in, and the more we sent out the faster the new requests came in.  We're at the point now where we get about 15 a day.  Joe writes a thank you in each and every one.  And almost instantly, sales took off.  Attendance jumped noticeably and MySpace/website action began a steady upward arc.  More importantly, we built an incredible database of his most hardcore fans. And after receiving a mailbox full of cds for free, they are  willing to do anything to help forward the cause.  And it is the ultimate in target marketing.... you have people who already like your music passing it on to their friends, whose tastes they presumably know.  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The idea is definitely a bit different, but obviously can and does work on a small scale.  The problem is that it wouldn't scale to a really large number very easily.  It's also somewhat costly.  Even if they've decreased the production costs, there are still costs in terms of resources, time and postage for every free CD they send out.  It's good that it's allowed them to more closely connect with fans (and turn them into &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080304/174129438.shtml"&gt;true fan&lt;/a&gt; promoters), but it seems risky to spend so much on promotions.  So, while it can work on a small scale, and help a musician stand out as being especially fan friendly, it seems like it could be pretty costly if you tried to scale it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1843393045.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1843393045.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/1843393045&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Do We Really Want An Internet Run By Lynch Mobs?</title>
			<dc:creator>Kevin Donovan</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081112/2001052815.shtml</link>

			<description>Sprint and Cogent were recently kind enough to &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081031/1107122702.shtml"&gt;remind us&lt;/a&gt; that the Internet is held together by rather tenuous peering deals to share traffic across providers. As such, some arcane disputes can aggravate to levels that disrupt normal consumers ability to use the Internet. If you weren't convinced that the good will of sysadmins keeps the series of tubes clear, two recent examples will show just how informal they can all be, and it raises some questions about the ability of "mob rule" to force certain decisions.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the past couple of months, two hosting companies who were known to be havens for spammers and cyber-criminals, have been brought offline through extralegal means. Following some &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081112/1236162810.shtml"&gt;pretty damning reports&lt;/a&gt; of the illegal uses of McColo and Intercage, the upstream ISPs servicing the hosting companies decided to pull the plug and disconnect them from the internet. Basically, a couple of ISP admins decided that they didn't want to be responsible for providing service to those companies so they cut them off. At first blush, these seem like effective actions taken against criminals -- some reports showed spam amounts dropping 66% following McColo's deathblow. &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&amp;#038;taxonomyName=Security&amp;#038;articleId=330172&amp;#038;taxonomyId=17"&gt;However, is this really the precedent we want?&lt;/a&gt;  Lynch mob justice, even when well meaning, can inflict collateral damage and occasionally pick the wrong targets leading to significant damage with little recourse. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some have equated these types of actions with a Neighborhood Watch program -- good intentioned folks driving off negative influences. But the key difference is the lack of legal authority and due process. Neighborhood watches call the police when illegal activity is detected. While it is true that McColo and Intercage were neutered much more quickly through extralegal means than if police had tried to understand the system and work through the courts, there are still very good reasons why we should support traditional legal prosecution. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An internet where ISPs can cut off service without explanation may be a very unstable platform, indeed. The checks and balances (eroded as they may be) of the legal system do a pretty good job at finding the best course of action, and we shouldn't rush to a future of lynch mobs. Lynch mobs (digital or not) have the unfortunate habit of negative side effects like choosing the wrong target or cutting off innocent users in the process. At least one ISP who cut off the criminal hosts claimed that they did so because the Terms of Service were being violated, but if they want to limit online crime, it would be best to utilize their leverage by working with law enforcement. After all, a phisher disconnected from the Internet can just move to another hosting provider where they will be less likely to be reached by America's comparatively stronger cybercrime laws.&lt;p style="border-top: 1px #aaaaaa dashed;padding-top: 5px;margin-top: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Donovan is an expert at the &lt;a href="http://www.insightcommunity.com/"&gt;Insight Community&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>If There's A National Cybersecurity Policy, What Should It Cover?</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1142253055.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1142253055.shtml</guid>
			<description>A bunch of folks have been sending in the various news stories about a new report recommending to the incoming presidential administration a &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/2008-12-08-obama-hacker_N.htm?csp=34" target="_new"&gt;set up a national cybersecurity policy&lt;/a&gt;, which is the sort of broad pronouncement that many people would instinctively agree with.  However, it's not really clear what this covers.  The report covers &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/bwdaily/dnflash/content/dec2008/db2008127_817606.htm" target="_new"&gt;both government and private companies' computer networks&lt;/a&gt;, as if the issues and challenges facing each should be covered under a single plan. There's also talk of some new kind of warrant called "data warrants" rather than search warrants.  Obviously, protecting internet infrastructure from foreign attacks is a good thing, but there's a lot here that seems like a grab for power -- and the ability to more closely gather and monitor data.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that government networks and security of government computers is a mess is one issue, but it shouldn't be mixed in with private companies protecting their own data.  The two issues should be tackled separately.  If the government needs to fix its own computer network and security policies, that seems like a reasonable job for the national CIO that Obama has indicated is a part of his plan, rather than a separate cybersecurity policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1142253055.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1142253055.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081208/1142253055&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Patent Lawsuit So Bogus That The Judge Ordered Sanctions And Attorney's Fees Paid</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/0158153029.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/0158153029.shtml</guid>
			<description>There are an awful lot of bogus patent lawsuits out there, but even when the lawsuits are tossed out it's very, very rare for a judge to order the plaintiffs to pay the legal fees of the defendants.  However, in Illinois it just happened.  Joe Mullin has the story of a patent that was &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; clearly limited to an &lt;i&gt;infrared camera&lt;/i&gt; linked to a GPS system.  The patent examiner required the inventor to include the word "infrared" before declaring the patent acceptable and non-obvious.  Yet, that didn't stop the patent holder from &lt;a href="http://thepriorart.typepad.com/the_prior_art/2008/12/triune-star-frivolous-patent-lawsuit.html" target="_new"&gt;suing LG, Pantech and Disney&lt;/a&gt; for the Disney mobile phone service that let parents &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20060405/0333251.shtml"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; where their kids were.  The product was a &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070927/215516.shtml"&gt;huge commercial failure&lt;/a&gt;, but those are three big companies worth suing for infringement.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, the judge noted, sternly, that the patent holder and the law firm that was handling the case (which had also worked on the patent) clearly decided to ignore what the patent actually said about it being for infrared cameras.  This practice is more common than it should be.  Even when claims are written to be narrowly focused, there's always some wiggle room, and many patent holders bring lawsuits on technologies that are pretty far from what's in the claims -- usually hoping that the accused will settle rather than take the issue to court.  In this case, though, the judge pointed out that it was clearly a frivolous lawsuit, and ordered the defendants get reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.  If this happened more often, maybe we'd see fewer ridiculous patent lawsuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/0158153029.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/0158153029.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081205/0158153029&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>When Life And Work Blend, Everything Is Commercial Use</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/2239253051.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/2239253051.shtml</guid>
			<description>I was recently having a talk with a friend who was trying to determine what to do next with his life.  He's not happy with his job and wants a "goal" for the future -- but isn't really sure what he wants to do.  I suggested focusing on a hobby in the short term and devoting plenty of time to it.  He felt that was the wrong approach, because a hobby is separate from a job, and the two would never connect.  While that &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; happen, the internet today has made it increasingly easy to turn a hobby into a job in some way or another.  It's not that you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to turn a hobby into a job.  Sometimes it's good for a hobby to just be a hobby.  But, if you focus on what you're passionate about, I think eventually different job opportunities start to come to you.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But it's this blurring of "personal" and "work" lives that again has me pondering if there really is a &lt;i&gt;meaningful&lt;/i&gt; distinction between "commercial use" and "non-commercial use."  Some of this debate first came about years ago, when some web publishers claimed that their RSS feeds were "for non-commercial use only," but &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061023/140659.shtml"&gt;what does that mean&lt;/a&gt;?  If I read your site as part of my job, have I violated that rule?  If I learn information from your feed that allows me to make money, have I violated that rule?  More recently, there have been proposals to separate copyright violations, such that "non-commercial use" &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080611/1900481382.shtml"&gt;is allowed&lt;/a&gt;.  But, again, you quickly run into very questionable scenarios.  If my personal blog has Google AdSense on it, is it commercial use?  If I end up getting a job because of my "personal use" of your content, does it suddenly morph into "commercial use"?  The questions get more and more confusing, and the mess would make less and less sense.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These days, it seems that the distinction between personal, professional, commercial and non-commercial are becoming increasingly meaningless -- and that's not a bad thing.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With that said, I have to agree with Gordon Haff over at News.com that Creative Commons is making a mistake in &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13556_3-10113230-61.html?part=rss&amp;#038;subj=news&amp;#038;tag=2547-1_3-0-20" target="_new"&gt;trying to better define the meaning of "commercial use" for its "non-commercial" licenses&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm already struggling with its current definition.  I'm working on a presentation for a conference I'm attending next month, and found some images that are under a CC license that allows non-commercial use.  I'm not getting paid for the talk itself, but I am doing it as a representative of Techdirt, which is a commercial entity.  Is that commercial use?  The presentation isn't about our business, though, but about what I usually write about here.  Is that non-commercial use?  I'm assuming it's non-commercial use, but these days, I have a hard time understanding what the difference is at all, and Haff is right that it's likely to lead to more confusion.  The real answer is to &lt;i&gt;simplify&lt;/i&gt; CC licenses, not make them even more complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/2239253051.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/2239253051.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/2239253051&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Stopping People From Spreading Your Ideas Doesn't Seem Very Smart</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>

			<description>Reader Another Mike sent in a long, but interesting story in Fast Company about a supposed "Green Guru" named William McDonough.  The &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/1042475/print" target="_new"&gt;profile is not particularly flattering&lt;/a&gt;, painting McDonough as a blatant self-promoter at all costs, ignoring various projects that have failed (and even describing them as successes many years after they were clearly massive failures).  However, what was most interesting for the stuff we discuss here was his overwhelming desire to retain "control" and "ownership" over his ideas.  We see this all too often, and it ends up doing a lot more damage than good -- and that's demonstrated repeatedly with McDonough.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In one example, he was hired by a carpet company to help present a business plan on how to make the company be a positive force for the environment.  Yet: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
"Bill presented a business plan that said he owned the rights," says John Picard, an environmental consultant on the team, "like it was his intellectual property. He was asking for an obscene amount [of money]."
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And that resulted in the company parting ways with McDonough:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
"The issue is that some of the things he thinks he originated no one owns. These are things that need to be blown up, not sequestered down with a patent." Interface went on to develop its recyclable carpet, now a nearly $1 billion business, without McDonough. The company confirmed the accuracy of Picard's account.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Next up, was his supposed "success story" with Nike:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
McDonough, who includes a Nike shoe in his standard slide show, recalls the period fondly. "The great thing about working with Nike was it had tremendous interest in communicating with its supply chain, and it took cradle-to-cradle ideas to heart and developed its own strategy for communicating across an immense supply chain, over 3,000 vendors," he tells me. "Incredible. It inspired us. A lot of what we do today is inspired by our clients."
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The folks at Nike remember the collaboration a little differently. "It was devastating that we couldn't go forward with it," says someone who worked closely on the project and requested anonymity. When McDonough's team finished building a list of approved materials for manufacturing, after two years and a hefty consulting fee, Nike told McDonough the time had come to share the details with its thousands of vendors. To the company's shock, McDonough responded that he owned the list -- it was proprietary. "He wanted to charge us for every supplier we rolled it out to. We didn't own it after we paid all this money, which made no sense," says the person from the Nike team. "You can develop lists until you're blue in the face, but if you don't have effective ways to roll that out to the supply chain, it's not going to change it." Nike, which went on to improve its supply chain independently, confirmed this account to Fast Company and said that, given the huge amount McDonough was demanding, it decided to terminate the relationship. The company adds that "neither Bill nor MBDC designed materials for Nike."
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Once again, in his demand for ownership of ideas, he's actually shut down.  Finally, perhaps the most ridiculous and damning story of all involves a non-profit that McDonough himself tried to set up to promote the term "cradle-to-cradle," which he has trademarked as a description of his process.  Of course, he didn't actually coin it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even the term cradle to cradle, for which McDonough has applied for a trademark, isn't his at all. According to Hunter Lovins, cofounder of the Rocky Mountain Institute think tank, "Walter Stahel in Switzerland actually coined the phrase 25 years ago, long before Bill started using it."
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The whole nonprofit, called GreenBlue was supposed to be used to promote "cradle-to-cradle" and build up McDonough's reputation.  And, in what appeared to be a contrary move to his earlier "ownership" position, McDonough announced GreenBlue with a plan to "give away the cradle-to-cradle protocol freely."  Except, he didn't.  The first employee at GreenBlue grew disenchanted, noting that McDonough did nothing to make "cradle-to-cradle" info publicly available.  So, he pleaded with the board to jettison McDonough -- which eventually happened.  And then, &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; McDonough left, GreenBlue became a success:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
It wasn't until McDonough left that GreenBlue, specifically its Sustainable Packaging Coalition, took off. The coalition now includes 190 companies -- Procter &amp;#038; Gamble, Kraft, and Starbucks among them -- that are working to develop environmentally sound packaging practices. "Many people still think of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition as a project that has succeeded because of Bill McDonough, which is simply not the case," Pearson stresses.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even better?  Now that GreenBlue is a success, McDonough, who &lt;i&gt;started it&lt;/i&gt; is demanding that GreenBlue pay lots of money to use that "cradle-to-cradle" trademark:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Earlier this year, his materials firm, MBDC, told GreenBlue it would have to license the term cradle to cradle if the nonprofit wanted to use it. "Our respective lawyers went back and forth at substantial cost to GreenBlue," says Pearson, now GreenBlue's executive director, "[but] I don't have the financial resources, nor the strong motivation, to stop them." By 2010, the very nonprofit that McDonough founded will be obliged to use terms such as "green chemistry," "closed-loop material systems," and "industrial ecology" to describe its work. Thanks to McDonough and his lawyers, Pearson says, "we will eliminate the phrase cradle to cradle from any of our materials."
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, in his quest to "own" all of these ideas, he's created a bunch of failed projects, and done little to actually help create successful environmental solutions.  Yet, when he gets out of the way, and others are able to more freely share ideas, stuff gets done.  Maybe he shouldn't focus so much on owning ideas, and be a little more open to the fact that if he shared more freely, and there were actual success stories built around his work, the demand to hire him in the future would be much, much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1958593018.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1958593018.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081203/1958593018&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Invest In Innovative Companies; Not Failing Ones</title>

			<description>While the US is looking to bail out its biggest businesses, it looks like the UK is working on a plan for the other end of the spectrum: &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/dec/07/nesta-plan-technology-startups" target="_new"&gt;creating a &amp;pound;1 billion "emergency" venture capital fund for startups&lt;/a&gt;.  While it's not clear how this money will actually get doled out, this could make a lot of sense.  With increasing rumors that existing venture funds are having &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081114/1529122835.shtml"&gt;some trouble&lt;/a&gt; getting limited partners to actually meet the capital calls they committed to, there is some worry that the next generation of innovation (which may be necessary to get us out of this economic funk) will be stymied.  While folks like Paul Graham are correctly pointing out that many internet startups these days &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/divergence.html" target="_new"&gt;really don't need venture capital&lt;/a&gt; to build success stories, that's not true of all startups.  There are still innovative startups that will need risk capital to get anywhere, and having more money focused on those early stage, innovative companies with high growth potential seems a lot more intriguing (and useful) than dumping hundreds of billions into mismanaged behemoths who will quickly squander what they're given, and come back asking for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1638093040.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1638093040.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/1638093040&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>First Thing We Do Is Automate Away All The Lawyers...</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>

			<description>Since we write about an awful lot of lawsuits and public policy issues around here, we often can be pretty harsh on lawyers (admittedly, we often fall short of appreciating the good lawyers who protect everyone from the worst abuses).  But, one thing that has seemed pretty clear is that, by opening up more legal issues, the pace of technology innovation has increased the demand for more lawyers.  But will that always be the case?  Apparently, some believe that a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/04/internet-law-and-technology" target="_new"&gt;business ripe for disintermediation, thanks to the internet, will be the legal profession&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is that a lot of basic (high margin) legal work can now be automated.  Part of this is probably true.  The amount that businesses have to pay for fairly routine processes can be quite ridiculous at times.  However, I doubt that the legal profession is really facing a shift as major as those facing, say, the entertainment industry.  It may cut out some margins on the low end of stuff usually handled by paralegals or new associates, but it seems likely that there will be plenty of room for lawyers.  Sometimes, in fact, it seems like our elected representatives are really mostly focused on a program of "full employment for lawyers," by passing laws that only require more lawyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1759523009.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1759523009.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081203/1759523009&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Online Video Sites Harming Themselves With Geographic Restrictions</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1933253017.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1933253017.shtml</guid>
			<description>Techdirt reader &lt;a href="http://www.e-ndeavor.com"&gt;Santiago Crespo&lt;/a&gt; recently wrote in making a really valid point about all the various authorized online video sites that seem to employ geographic restriction, much to their own detriment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
I live in Argentina, in South America and am an avid Heroes and House follower, but there's a problem watching those shows in our side of the world. Big network subsidiaries offer cable access to American TV shows, but for some unknown reason they can take up to six months to subtitle them in Spanish, and therefore we're stuck watching last season episodes all the time. I don't need subtitles to watch the series, since my grasp of the English language is decent enough to understand what the show is about.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But every time you want to use any legal video site such as Hulu, the NBC website, Sling.com or even some bits of YouTube (Geo-restricted music videos), it will show an &lt;a href="http://i38.tinypic.com/6s4505.jpg" target="_new"&gt;error message saying you're "geographically challenged."&lt;/a&gt; So instead of geolocalizing ads (as Google does, since I get ads for Deremate.com, a Latin American eBay clone here on Techdirt) they leave me no choice but to head over to the pirate bay to get my fix ad-free.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And even if your comprehension of English isn't good enough to watch the shows downloaded from Bittorrent, every single TV episode gets fansubbed within 24 hours of airing.  I think the big networks are wasting a revenue opportunity by limiting who can watch their shows (6 months from now if you have cable) instead of letting you watch them on-line (unlimited audience potential) with some geo-located ads.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It's a really good point.  Some of it may be due to rather old school and silly geographic "rights" issues, where certain contracts allow companies to only have the right to broadcast content in certain geographies so that the content owner can try to resell the same content in other areas as well.  Yet, by now it should be clear that geographic specific content makes less and less sense, and really is detrimental to the content owners.  Rather than making it easier to score big deals, all they're doing is encouraging piracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1933253017.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081203/1933253017.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081203/1933253017&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Microsoft Jumping On The T-Shirt Bandwagon</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>

			<description>For years, critics of this site have made fun of us (incorrectly) by claiming that we're really telling content creators of all kind to bet their business model on selling t-shirts.  That, of course, isn't true, but we &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081010/1715412521.shtml"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; seeing t-shirts show up in odd places -- and recently discovered that the branded t-shirt market is &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081124/1709222941.shtml"&gt;a decent size&lt;/a&gt;.  Who's the latest to jump in?  Apparently Microsoft.  Seriously.  Ad Age is reporting that Microsoft &lt;a href="http://adage.com/agencynews/article?article_id=133069" target="_new"&gt;is coming out with its own clothing line&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on the sort of retro-geek/ironic look that's been sort of trendy in the t-shirt space.  They're calling it "Softwear" (not soft&lt;i&gt;ware&lt;/i&gt;, get it?), and it will even include the infamous &lt;a href="http://www.mugshots.org/misc/bill-gates.html"&gt;Bill Gates' mugshot&lt;/a&gt; among other Microsoft-related images from the 80s.  And, no, I doubt anyone expects this to be a big money maker, but with so many people actually selling t-shirts and with a bunch of folks in the &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081204/1453233022.shtml#comments"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; recently requesting t-shirts from us, maybe we should have some fun and offer some up.  I'd probably get one that read &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081124/0033382934.shtml#c39"&gt;LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTS of T-shirts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1614193039.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1614193039.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/1614193039&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Music Games Drive Kids' Interest In Real Instruments</title>

			<description>A report from the UK says that 20 percent of the kids there that have played music video games like &lt;i&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rock Band&lt;/i&gt; have &lt;a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article5266959.ece"&gt;picked up real instruments&lt;/a&gt; because of the games. The author of the report says it shows that when music is presented to kids in new and compelling ways, it can get them interested in creating their own music. We'll note it's nice to see that kids getting excited by video games can have some positive effects and not only translate into violence, as one &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081202/0353332996.shtml"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; study said. It's also interesting to note that Gibson says it's getting a sales bump from the games, particularly for its iconic Les Paul guitar, after which one of the plastic axes in &lt;i&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/i&gt; is modeled. This is a little ironic, after Gibson wanted to &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080312/012013508.shtml"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; some money from Activision by waving an unrelated patent in its face and trying to get the company to license it. This further illustrates to record companies how these games can add &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081001/0245102424.shtml"&gt;value&lt;/a&gt; to their content and serve to promote it, but sadly, you know that somehow that lesson will still be &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080807/1025451922.shtml"&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; on the labels.&lt;p style="border-top: 1px #aaaaaa dashed;padding-top: 5px;margin-top: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carlo Longino is an expert at the &lt;a href="http://www.insightcommunity.com/"&gt;Insight Community&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Turning Down A Chance To Own 10% Of Apple</title>

			<description>Computer Shopper is running an article, written by the magazine's first editor, Stan Veit, talking about his experience running a small computer store in NY and dealing with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak before Apple was even a company -- when they were pushing him to sell their Apple I machines (which were more computer boards than complete machines at the time).  But the most amusing part is Steve Jobs' &lt;a href="http://computershopper.com/feature/apple-computer-the-very-early-years" target="_new"&gt;offer to give him 10% of the company in exchange for $10,000&lt;/a&gt;.  It's an entertaining look into some of the very, very early days of Apple (when Woz was still working at HP).

			<title>UK ISPs Block Wikipedia Page; Cause Problem With UK Editing</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>

			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1805293043.shtml</guid>
			<description>One of the big problems with the idea of various governments around the world coming up with "blacklists" that ISPs have to block access to, is that it will always create huge questions over borderline content.  At least if there's a lawsuit that involves taking down specific illegal content, there's due process to determine if the content is actually illegal.  But handing that authority to a single entity with no outstanding review process seems quite dangerous.  And, now, it's resulted in a variety of UK ISPs, who subscribe to Internet Watch Foundation UK's blacklist, to &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia/" target="_new"&gt;block a particular page on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.  The page itself is about an album, Virgin Killer, from the German band Scorpions.  Apparently, the cover of the album includes a photo that many feel is child pornography.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, in blocking out this page, there have been some unintended consequences.  Apparently, the way that the ISPs are blocking access to the page involves a transparent proxy, that effectively routes all customers through a very small number of IP addresses -- and that's causing a second problem.  Many of the users of those ISPs are now banned from editing &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; Wikipedia article.  Basically, if &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; from those IPs gets on the banned list, it now affects every user, and that's what's happened for at least a segment of the UK population at this point.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And, of course, this action hasn't done anything to prevent or slow down the spread of a potentially illegal image.  Because of the attempted block -- The Register notes the image is still available on Amazon's UK site -- plenty of others are also posting the image to point out how silly it is to set up such a block.  Once again, this demonstrates the futility of such filtering systems.  If certain content is illegal, go after it with laws -- not a secretive filtering process that will create unintended consequences with no warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1805293043.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081207/1805293043.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081207/1805293043&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Joe Satriani Sues Coldplay For Copyright Infringement</title>
			<dc:creator>Blaise Alleyne</dc:creator>
			<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/1146593034.shtml</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/1146593034.shtml</guid>
			<description>Guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani has &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7766683.stm"&gt;sued Coldplay for copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt; over claims that their hit single, &lt;em&gt;Viva La Vida&lt;/em&gt;, used "substantial original portions" of his song &lt;em&gt;If I Could Fly&lt;/em&gt; from 2004, seeking damages for "any and all profits." The lawsuit has been filed in Los Angeles federal court. Call me a skeptic, but it was just back in June when we wrote about a band called Creaky Boards making a &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080701/0154411560.shtml"&gt;similar claim&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is that the Creaky Boards didn't sue. They made a cheeky video and used the opportunity to get some attention (also, later retracting the statement after Coldplay refuted it). However, one notable difference here is that Coldplay was very unlikely to have heard the Creaky Boards song, while Joe Satriani is well known, especially among guitarists. When you listen to this clip, &lt;a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/theampersand/archive/2008/12/05/216213.aspx"&gt;the melodies are certainly very similar&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1ofFw9DKu_I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1ofFw9DKu_I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But does that mean it was copied? Most people's knee-jerk reaction is to assume it must have been, but here's an idea: Creaky Boards, Coldplay and Joe Satriani all have a similar melody over a similar chord sequence. When Coldplay responded to Creaky Boards, Chris Martin called it a "simple coincidence." Is it not plausible that it's just a &lt;em&gt;somewhat natural melody&lt;/em&gt; to sing over those chords? You can't copyright a chord sequence. If you &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAbqMfPjQ4Y"&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XEUjvEDvro"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTPIFn20mOs"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjPAEPFaxoM"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4KX7SkDe4Q&amp;"&gt;sorts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOd9Of0-8J0"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktXZeXQrgpo"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;, you quickly realize that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM"&gt;a lot of songs sound the same&lt;/a&gt;. Some cases are blatant infringement, but for most, there are only so many notes in a scale...
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chris Martin &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7381688/qa_chris_martin"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "We're definitely good, but I don't think you can say we're that original. I regard us as being incredibly good plagiarists." I bet he wishes he hadn't said that now, but to what extent is that true about all of our ideas? Isn't a certain element of "plagiarism" a natural part of the &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080924/0408022358.shtml"&gt;creative process&lt;/a&gt;? Where's the line between &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20061204/203658.shtml"&gt;plagiarism and inspiration&lt;/a&gt;? Of course, trying to pass someone's work off as your own is bad because it's dishonest and you aren't giving proper &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080808/2157481936.shtml"&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt;, and your &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070219/010207.shtml"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; will likely suffer for it if someone finds out. But even if Coldplay &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get the melody from Satriani (whether consciously or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia"&gt;unconsciously&lt;/a&gt;), how much damage have they done? If you listen to the theme of Satriani's song and the verse of Coldplay's, the melodies are very similar, but the songs in their entirety are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different. Coldplay takes the song in a completely different direction in the chorus, while that melody &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Satriani's chorus. Coldplay's song has lyrics, Satriani's is instrumental. They appeal to different audiences, they're very different songs. Even if it is an case of infringement, how significant is it?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
That's saying little about the legal realities though. It's bound to be a sticky issue in court. Coldplay will likely claim independent creation to try and clear their name (unless they did blatantly rip it off, in which case they might look for a settlement). How do you prove whether or not someone came up with a melody independently? How many notes or rhythms need to be similar to prove that one melody is a derivative of another? This is going to be an interesting case to watch.&lt;p style="border-top: 1px #aaaaaa dashed;padding-top: 5px;margin-top: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blaise Alleyne is an expert at the &lt;a href="http://www.insightcommunity.com/"&gt;Insight Community&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Spore's DRM So Effective It Was The Most Downloaded Game Of The Year</title>
			<dc:creator>Michael Masnick</dc:creator>

			<description>It never really made sense for EA to be so insistent on having draconian DRM on games.  Before the company even launched Spore people made it &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080507/1353061058.shtml"&gt;quite clear&lt;/a&gt; the plan would backfire, but EA went forward with it anyway, creating a &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080924/1831242364.shtml"&gt;PR nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.  And all for what?  Turns out (not surprisingly) the DRM didn't do squat to stop unauthorized file sharing.  Spore has now been declared &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-pirated-games-of-2008-081204/" target="_new"&gt;the most downloaded video game of the year&lt;/a&gt;.  And, even though the year's not over, no other game is going to catch up.  And, it's worth noting, the game only launched in October, so this is only over a couple of months.  In other words, EA's "antipiracy strategy" backfired almost completely.  The company got a huge PR blackeye which probably only encouraged &lt;i&gt;more people&lt;/i&gt; to download the game via file sharing.  Can someone explain, again, why any company thinks DRM works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/1533083035.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081205/1533083035.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20081205/1533083035&amp;op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
