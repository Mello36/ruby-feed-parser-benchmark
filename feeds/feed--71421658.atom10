			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For anyone who hasn&#8217;t been paying attention, there is a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe.  This all started when sanitation workers and mechanical engineers stopped coming into work because they weren&#8217;t getting paid. This caused pipes to burst, so they shut off the water.</p>
<p>How you cure cholera is gatorade and acne medication.  The problem is that there&#8217;s no water and the medical staff isn&#8217;t getting paid either.</p>
<p>Mugabe is now claiming that the cholera epidemic has ended, and thus there is no longer a need for the U.S. and Britain to invade Zimbabwe, though he added that Britain ought to be invaded because they have mad cow disease.</p>
<p><span id="more-317"></span></p>
<p>What I seem to have missed is the call for the U.S. and Britain to invade Zimbabwe in the first place.  Mugabe is so delusional at this point that he actually believes the &#8220;colonial powers&#8221; are looking for (or even require) a pretense to invade Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Let me just say that there is no way the epidemic is cured because the economy is not cured.  But Mr. Mugabe, I will happily be your straw man:</p>
<p>On behalf of the colonial powers, I think we should invade Zimbabwe and arrest Mugabe for failing to attempt to solve the 4 year old humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is work for His Majesty, President Obama.</p>
<p>Mr. Mugabe, in your words, go hang.</p>

<p><span id="more-312"></span></p>
<p>Red Alert 2</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know what it is about red alert 2.  There seems to be so much to do with the sheer intensity of it all.  I suppose it&#8217;s simply that I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing if I remade this game.  Red Alert 2 keeps me coming back again and again and holds a special place in my heart, representing the halcyon days when EA didn&#8217;t suck.</p>
<p>Sims 2</p>
<p>Replayability.  Hot damn can you play this game over and over again.  The cool thing about it?  The more you play it the more fun it gets.  Once you have great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren there&#8217;s a whole legacy behind each of your sims.  With witches and werewolves and vampires there&#8217;s just more to do here than in a lifetime.  Luckily you can have as many lifetimes as you want.  The only thing I&#8217;d change is some kind of difficulty setting.  I&#8217;m not sure how it would work but the appeal of Sims 2 is in it&#8217;s ability to wrap you up in your sims lives, not give you an actual challenge.  Sims 3 looks on schedule to replace its predecessor on this list.</p>
<p>Portal</p>
<p>GlaDOS, simple premise, badass puzzles, some intrigue.  This game is just perfect.  It would have made the top spot if there was any extended replayability value.</p>
<p>MarioKart 64</p>
<p>Multiplayer heaven.  MarioKart 64 is just awesome in a way none of the others are.  I&#8217;ll admit I haven&#8217;t played the DS MarioKart, and it does look to have some promise.  Best racing game ever.</p>
<p>Starfox 64</p>
<p>Original title for N64 and it can still put me in a trance, single or multi.  Easy to learn, simple maps, yet those battles are epic every time.  The necessity to unplug a controller to decrease the number of players puts me in stitches every time.</p>
<p>X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter</p>
<p>Hot damn is this a good game.  With pretty much no graphics at all, they capture absolutely everything you need on a star destroyer.  You have complete control over everything in your ship in a way that no Star Wars game has done since.  X v TIE will leave you yelling at Battlefront II that that&#8217;s not the way the TIE&#8217;s lasers work.  Priceless game, so long and with so many bonuses and secrets that there&#8217;s alot of replayability in there too.</p>
<p>Wii Sports</p>
<p>Wii Sports is too young to have withstood the test of time, yet I find myself popping it in the Wii over games that I paid $50 for.  This is the ultimate party game.  Wii Bowling takes little enough concentration that it doesn&#8217;t have to take center stage in a gathering and it can still be fun for everyone.  Let&#8217;s also not forget that this game brought video games into vogue in the party scene.</p>
<p>Sim Earth</p>
<p>Will Wright is a genius.  Not yet harassed by EA execs, Maxis made the only truly great mixing of video games and science.  Sim Earth teaches and has infinite replayability.  Ever wondered what a 2% change in albedo effect will do to arthropod population levels in the arctic circle?  Wonder no more.  Lets not forget that none of us would know what a cetacean is without this game either.</p>
<p>Black &amp; White</p>
<p>Creatures.  The creatures were awesome.  I trained mine to poop on enemy houses as a way to keep their towns from growing too powerful.  What other game has that?  Teaches conditioning, even caring for an animal.  This game is sweet.  Big problem with the 1.0 release crashing in single player if you made it to the 5th level though.  Sloppy debugging.</p>
<p>Rock Band II</p>
<p>The original Rock Band might deserve this title, as it has everything great about Rock Band II.  This game is just a blast, and the center of any party it&#8217;s at.</p>
<p>Feel free to argue.</p>

<p>Roger Ebert <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/win_ben_steins_mind.html">PWNS inteligent design apologist and game show host ameritus, Ben Stein</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;ve been accused of refusing to review Ben Stein&#8217;s documentary &#8220;Expelled,&#8221; a defense of Creationism, because of my belief in the theory of evolution. Here is my response. </em></p>
<p>Ben Stein, you hosted a TV show on which you gave away money. Imagine that I have created a special edition of &#8220;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&#8221; just for you. Ben, you&#8217;ve answered all the earlier questions correctly, and now you&#8217;re up for the $1 million prize. It involves an explanation for the evolution of life on this planet. You have already exercised your option to throw away two of the wrong answers. Now you are faced with two choices: (A) Darwin&#8217;s Theory of Evolution, or (B) Intelligent Design.</p>
<p>Because this is a special edition of the program, you can use a Hotline to telephone every scientist on Earth who has an opinion on this question. You discover that 99.975 of them agree on the answer (A). A million bucks hangs in the balance. The clock is ticking. You could use the money. Which do you choose? You, a firm believer in the Constitution, are not intimidated and exercise your freedom of speech. You choose (B).</p>
<p><strong> <em> Squaaawk!!! </em> </strong> The klaxon horn sounds. You have lost.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nate Silver, on his now pollster cannon blog <a href="fivethrityeight.com">fivethirtyeight.com</a>, has a good <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/12/who-are-swing-senators.html">post on the swing senators for both parties </a>that all of us should be keeping our eyes on over the next two years:</p>
<blockquote><p>In practice, there will be a group of four or five senators in each party who line up just to either side of the 60-seat threshold and will find that they&#8217;re suddenly very much in demand. If Obama&#8217;s approval ratings are strong, he should have little trouble whipping the couple of Republican votes he needs into shape, and should clear 60 comfortably on key issues. But, if Obama proves to be unpopular, there remain enough conservative, red-state Democratic senators to deny him a simple majority on key issues, much less 60 votes.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" title="Florida Rep" src="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/congress/members/photos/228/R000435.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="276" /></p>
<p>The Politco has an amusing piece regarding the manner in which President Elect Obama tried to greet Florida Rep. Lleana Ros-Lehtinen.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>On Wednesday, the Republican congresswoman got a call from President-elect Barack Obama, didn&#8217;t believe it was him, and hung up on him. Twice.</em></p>
<p><em>According to Ros-Lehtinen&#8217;s flack Alex Cruz, the congresswoman received the call on her cell phone from a Chicago-based number and an aide informed her that Obama wanted to speak to her. When Obama introduced himself, Ros-Lehtinen cut him off and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry but I think this is a joke from one of the South Florida radio stations known for these pranks.&#8221; Then she hung up.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Oops. Obama&#8217;s got a good sense of humor though, and he tried back a third time:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It isÂ very funny that you have twice hung up on me,&#8221; Obama said. Ros Lehtinen responded by telling Obama that radio stations in South Florida always make these sorts of jokes. Obama saidÂ similar pranksters reside in Chi-town.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of when <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1108/Sarkozy_calling.html?showall">Sarah Palin got a prank call </a>during the campaign from some Montreal radio hosts pretending to be French President Sarkozy. This goes along with my theory that conservatives don&#8217;t get what humor is. They either see it when its not there (this example, or ANY attempt at humor from Malkin), or they don&#8217;t get it when it is there.</p>

<p>Yep, Michelle Malkin is actually using <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/03/who-will-make-the-other-prop-8-musical/">her blog to </a><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/03/who-will-make-the-other-prop-8-musical/">encourage people to make anti-gay musicals</a><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/03/who-will-make-the-other-prop-8-musical/">.</a> How childish is she? The pro-gay movement is making a musical, the anti-gayÂ  crowd needs one too! This is why nobody takes you seriously michelle.

<p>Today Jim DeMinit (R-S.C.) <a href="http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/12/02/demint-capitol-visitor-center-fails-to-honor-faith/">lambasted the new visitor center</a> (yes, this guy has time in this economic crisis to comment on that state of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/12/02/capitol.visitor.center/index.html">new visitor center on Capital Hill</a>) as &#8220;Left-leaning&#8221;, and &#8220;<span class="greycopy">portray[s] the federal government as the fulfillment of human ambition and the answer to all of societyâ€™s problems.&#8221; DeMint suggests &#8220;</span><span class="greycopy">This is a clear departure from acknowledging that Americansâ€™ rights â€˜are endowed by their Creatorâ€™ and stem from â€˜a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence.â€™&#8221; Right, because it was God who co-sponsord the New Deal, and it was God who finished that hard work on the Union-Pacific rail road, and oh yeah, wasn&#8217;t it God who ended slavery? Listen to this guy:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="greycopy">â€œThe Capitol Visitor Center is designed to tell the history and purpose of our nation&#8217;s Capitol, but it <strong>(1) fails to appropriately honor our religious heritage </strong>that has been critical to Americaâ€™s success. While the Architect of the Capitol has pledged to include some references to faith, more needs to be done. You<strong> (2)cannot accurately tell the history of America or its Capitol by ignoring the religious heritage of our Founders</strong> and the generations since who relied on their faith for strength and guidance. The millions of visitors that will visit the CVC each year <strong>(3)should get a true portrayal of the motivations and inspirations</strong> of those who have served in Congress since its establishment.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="greycopy">I noticed a few things about this statement, and you can refer to the numerated phrases in the quote.</span><br />
<span id="more-279"></span></p>
<p><span class="greycopy">(1). I don&#8217;t think he means our puritan heritage, and one must really ask why it would be appropriate to include a tribute to any deity on capital hill, thanking them for helping our country go from dream to reality. If anything, i assure you it overemphasizes it by replacing critical thought and hard work with devine intervention in some way.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="greycopy">(2) You can&#8217;t? Fun fact, Thomas Jefferson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible" target="_blank">wrote his own verion of the Bible</a> that takes out all references to God and any supernatural activity. I wonder if he thinks you could tell the story of America&#8217;s heritage by ignoring God. DeMint is one of these guys who thought the founders put Christmas in the constitution, that the pledge always had &#8220;under god&#8221; in it, and that our money always said &#8220;in god we trust&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="greycopy">(3) I think he means we need gigantic statues of John Locke, Rousseu, Hobbes, Weber, and host of others, rather some archaic &#8220;old&#8221; god that cares more for smiting non-believers that politcal theory. seriously, everything God decreed was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi" target="_blank">plagiarized from the Code of Hamurabi</a> anyway.</span>When will we kick the Jesus freaks from our capitals?</p>

<p>It appears that <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/11/28/where-are-all-the-anti-inauguration-activists-now/" target="_blank">Michell Malkin doesn&#8217;t undersatnd</a> that protesters during the last two inaugurations weren&#8217;t protesting against the idea of inaugurations, they were protesting against the guy being inaugurated. Does Malking really think they were protesting against the ceremony? Also, do you really want to be that guy protesting at the first black president&#8217;s inauguration?</p>
<p>Malkin&#8217;s posts are written in a fire and brimstone anger that is barely contained by the text.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Obamaâ€™s Chicago machine is kicking into high gear to plan and fund his massive, unprecedented inaugural festivities. He just appointed an inauguration planning committee that <em>includes his hometown cronies</em> William Daley and Penny Pritzker<strong>.</strong>Theyâ€™ve got a <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/content/home/">campaign-style website</a> counting down the days to the massive party in Washington. To <strong>deflect attention from the costs, the Oneâ€™s party planners are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/politics/26inaug.html?ref=politics">patting themselves on the back</a> for limiting inaugural donations to individual contributions of $50,000 </strong>â€” a move<em> they say i</em>s historic. But Bill Clinton also refused corporate money for his second inaugural and capped donations at $100. (Bush raised $42 million for his second inaugural, mostly from corporate donors, capped at $250,000.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I mean come on. &#8220;hometown cronies&#8221; ? They planning a PARTY. It&#8217;s not like these guys are running FEMA or anything. Cause that would be ridiculous, right? How can Malkin even consider this information critical of Obama? He&#8217;s only accepting donations from individuals. He&#8217;s the first person to ever cap donations. All of this, after Bush had a $40,000,000 inaugeral ball.Â  *sound of hand slapping forehead*</p>
