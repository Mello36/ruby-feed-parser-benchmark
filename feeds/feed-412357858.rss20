Even though I have to say it's not that relevant globally (at least for now). If we had the source's to the array, it makes it better and gives a true indication of what people expect from this source, but then it's also too big for a good dashboard!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">julien51</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 00:55:16 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: New features are on the horizon</title><link>http://blog.disqus.net/2008/12/03/new-features-are-on-the-horizon/#comment-4217414</link><description>I would love all of the them actually ;-) And even more.

It might sound something stupid, but the greatest value for Google is not the ability to "query" it, but the ability to display my services in the "the top line".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At notifixious, notification is free... because it's not where the greates value is! The greatest value -at least as we perceive it now- is what sources are users follow, and which of them really matters to them!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">julien51</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2008 21:20:14 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: obscurely famous</title><link>http://obscurelyfamous.com/post/60975284#comment-3950947</link><description>I must have been pretty lucky, since I never got any spam on my Disqus ;-) When you say you use Akismet and stuff.. do you also use the tools that I have installed locally on my blog?

A lot of companies are filing a lot of patents... I think that some idiot filed a patent on "pixels" a while back. IBM and Intel must have a boatload. Apple patents have started the first iPhone rumors, but while it might not be "worth" it (depending on your definition of worth), it's often a good topic for discussion :)</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/11/apple_patent_for_alwayson_displays_would_it_use_eink.html</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2008 19:57:58 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Apple Always-On Display</title><link>http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/11/apple_patent_for_alwayson_displays_would_it_use_eink.html#comment-3918232</link><description>Isn't Apple one of the most prolific companies in terms of patent?
