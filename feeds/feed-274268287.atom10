So, what&#8217;s new? Well, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that we&#8217;ve <a href="http://phantommoose.com/filmmaker-networking-list/">posted the list page</a>, and it actually has more people on it than us!<span id="more-666"></span> Right now, there are five fine people on the list for you to get to know. In order for the list to grow, we need <em>you </em> to keep networking with other filmmakers. If you know any other people who should be on this list, please send them to the original post announcing the list, and encourage them to get to know us. We promise not to bite them. <img src='http://phantommoose.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>If you are on the list, please, put a link to the list page on your Web site. It&#8217;s one of the best ways to spread the word.</p>
<p>An interesting bit came out of this project. <a href="http://jordanmharris.wordpress.com/">Jordan Harris</a> left a comment on the original post, suggesting that the list become a full-fledged networking site. We&#8217;re certainly open to the possibility, if the list gets big enough. And we&#8217;re also very open to your ideas about making this list a bigger project. If you have something for us, either leave a comment here, or <a href="http://phantommoose.com/contact-us/">send us a contact.</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now. We&#8217;re excited to see where this goes in the future!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://phantommoose.com/2008/11/28/were-making-a-list/"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important things in the film business is networking. The more people you know, the better chance you have of working on something big and cool.</p>
<p>Since we started blogging on Phantom Moose, we&#8217;ve been blown away by the number of talented teen filmmakers we&#8217;ve met. Some of you have even emailed us and asked if you could help out with the next film. That&#8217;s great, and we love meeting young filmmakers like ourselves. Which is why we&#8217;re announcing a new project.<span id="more-657"></span></p>
<p>The idea is to create a list of teen filmmakers, with a short description of what they do, and a link to their blog or Web site. Then we&#8217;ll post the list on Phantom Moose. Those on the list would either post the list on their sites, or post a link back to the list here on Phantom Moose.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of being on this list? Suppose that you are working on a big movie project. You write the script and discover that you&#8217;re going to need some cool CG special effects. You know nothing about that sort of thing, and you can&#8217;t think of anybody who does. With this list, you can see who does CG special effects, go to their Web site, and get in touch with them.</p>
<p>This can be repeated for nearly any task that you need done. Now you&#8217;re collaborating with other people, getting them involved, and your project can become better than you&#8217;d expected. That&#8217;s the power of collaboration.</p>
<p>How do you get on the list? Here&#8217;s what we need from you. Head over to the <a href="http://phantommoose.com/contact-us/">contact form</a> and shoot us an email. We need your name, Web site URL, and a brief (50 words max) description of what you do. We&#8217;ll check out your site and get back to you.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t yet have a Web site, there&#8217;s no time like the present to get one. Check out <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> or <a href="https://www.blogger.com/start">Blogger</a> to register a free blog.</p>
<p>We hope to hear from you soon!</p>

It’s hard enough making an eight inch stuffed animal look like he’s thinking and walking and talking, but having him run around with people? People at least five times his size? Thankfully, we had had experience with the basic kitty moves. Wiggle him, he looks like he’s talking. Hop him around on strings, he’s walking. The real pinch was in taking him outside of Mr. Kitty’s Babysitting Set, and putting him in there with the big dogs.<span id="more-637"></span><a class="thickbox" rel="Kitty Cone" href="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/kittycostume.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The first thing we worked on was costume. Jordan’s sister Becca came to my rescue and made the wonderful little shirt and pants that Kitty Cone wears. (At the time we knew we were going to be spoofing a certain science fiction badguy, so a lot of black in the costume was a given.) So, we had a costume that the audience could associate Kitty with. Then we pulled a switch. You only see Kitty in his official costume part of the time. A lot of the filming was done with Kitty wearing a sort of elongated black skirt. That allowed us to stick our arm up through under cover of the black fabric and hang onto his feet. Kitty is a very stiff little critter, and you can get a lot of wiggle out of that position. We used this “sock puppet” approach in a lot of the close ups, and particularly whenever he popped up from behind something.</p>
<p><a class="thickbox" rel="Kitty Cone" href="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/rebekahsplat.jpg"><img class="left size-thumbnail wp-image-643" title="Rebekah Doing Kitty" src="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/rebekahsplat-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Now, that method was all well and good, but if a character is always standing behind things you start to wonder whether he has any legs at all. It worked with Kitty Cone because he was short—so obviously, if he wanted to talk to anyone he had to stand on something tall. I guess we could have left things at the puppet stage, but we decided to push the boundaries a little bit. How hard could it be to make Kitty look like he was walking on his own?</p>
<p>We ended up with a combination of strings, dowels, and computer magic to make it work. There’s this great spool of gray-brown thread that’s been in our movie kit forever and ever. It blends in with practically everything, and especially our basement carpet. All we have to do is attach it to Kitty somewhere and then tie the other end to a long dowel. Someone stands out of camera view and makes him bounce around. His long sword was a definite plus for this because it weighed him down and kept him from revolving while in midair. Then, if all else failed, we simply edited out the arm or string that Kitty was attached to.</p>

<a href="http://vimeo.com/2249109">Kitty Cone Puppetry</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/phantommoose">Phantom Moose Films</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thickbox" rel="Kitty Cone" href="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/rebekahsplatduel.jpg"><img class="left size-thumbnail wp-image-644" title="Rebekah Doing Kitty for the Duel" src="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/rebekahsplatduel-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The duel presented a whole new set of problems. I remember one idea we bounced around was that Kitty would grab one of the Norse Guards and have him push a little wheeled cart around so Kitty could duel from the top of it. Thankfully we didn’t have to deal with that. A simple paintbrush attached to the sword made it possible for the two blades to reach each other. (At the time we were keeping the lightsabers as a big secret. We filmed the duel when the parents were away and had plenty of pre-thought out answers, just in case anyone asked what the paintbrush was for.) The fancy flip that Kitty does over Stelen wasn’t really that fancy. We just threw Kitty and told Stelen to duck.</p>
<p>As with any good puppet, you have to add sound effects to make it come to life. Jordan was our vocal and foley artist for this. He did everything from shuffling in slippers to thumping on the wall.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a positive experience. For <em>almost</em> everyone concerned. We had to sew Kitty’s eyebrows and mustache to his face. I’m pretty sure he didn’t like that. They must have itched.</p>

<p>Believe me, after twenty minutes of acting under two-thousand watts of light (and more than five yards of velvet) you feel like you&#8217;re flying, and it&#8217;s not a pleasant sensation.</p>
<p><a class="thickbox" rel="bluescreen" href="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bluescreen.jpg"><img class="left size-thumbnail wp-image-611" title="The Blue Screen" src="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bluescreen-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Staying cheerful and hydrated during the Flying Machine Sequence was one of the hardest and most personally challenging things I did during the production of iSundae II. The staying cheerful part especially. Bad attitudes can spread like wildfire on the best of days, and filming in a tight area just makes them spread faster. I think the extra effort showed as Gwenanda getting steadily crazier. We got quite a few outtakes and &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; clips. I guess those made up, in a small way, for the difficulties.<span id="more-601"></span></p>
<p>The room we were filming in would have been a great size if we had taken all the furniture out, but that wasn&#8217;t really practical. So all seven of us crammed in between the couches, television, speakers, bookcases, recliner, and foosball table. Us, and two of our biggest production lights. When you get that many heat-producing bodies in that size of an area, things warm up really quick. With the lights it was just awful. Oh, and then we lost about three feet off of one end of the room because the weather-balloon of a blue screen had to hang a ways out from the wall. But somehow we all crammed in there and made it to filming.</p>
<p>As soon as you can get over not being able to see much and the vague feeling that you&#8217;re in a giant microwave, filming with the big lights isn&#8217;t too bad. I&#8217;m here to testify that you can get used to it! Just make sure that none of your costume fabrics are flammable.</p>
<p><a class="thickbox" rel="bluescreen" href="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bluescreen2.jpg"><img class="left size-thumbnail wp-image-612" title="Wide Shot of the Blue Screen" src="http://phantommoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bluescreen2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Acting for this scene was easy. We actually got to sit down almost the entire time! We faced the flying machine left, and said our lines. We faced the machine toward the camera, and said our lines. We turned to the right, and said our lines. You get the basic idea. And you&#8217;d think we would know our lines really well by the end of the first two times through, but you&#8217;re reckoning without the heat. And it didn&#8217;t help that as we got more loopy, things seemed more funny.</p>
<p>All in all it was a . . . good experience. I now know how to survive under all that velvet. <em>You don&#8217;t think about it, and try to help everyone else forget that we&#8217;re presenting a passable imitation of  baked trout.</em> And it did pay off. We got some great footage and ended up having fun.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video of some of the craziness from the flying machine filming day:</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://phantommoose.com/2008/10/18/filming-a-musical-number/"><![CDATA[<p>(This post references <a href="http://phantommoose.com/2008/10/14/isundae-ii-part-8-of-10/">iSundae II: Attack of the Cones, part 8</a>. You may want to view the movie before reading this post.)</p>
<p>Some people learn slower than others. That&#8217;s got to be the only explanation for why we decided to throw not one, but <em>two</em> musical numbers into our second movie. Wasn&#8217;t iSundae I hard enough? Maybe we&#8217;re gluttons for punishment. Or maybe the songs just begged to be written. But however it happened, we wound up with two scenes that involved singing. Singing in the middle of the woods, no less. Are we nuts or what? <span id="more-585"></span></p>
<p>I have it! We were lured into thinking it would be easier because the basics aren&#8217;t that hard. We create the music for the song first, then pre-record the vocals and burn them and the music to a CD. When we want to film the actor singing, we play the CD and the actor sings along. This lets the actor get really close to the original timing of the song and makes the lip syncing look even smoother. Once we have it all filmed, we erase the sound from the visual clips and replace it with the pre-recorded audio. How easy! But wait until you try to film it. Things can get out of hand really quick.</p>
<p>Although we are by no means competent (much less comfortable) with filming musical numbers, here area few tips we want to pass along to anyone who is . . . uh . . . <em>(crazy, nuts, intrepid, confident . . . what do I say?)</em> . . . bold enough to try it.</p>
<h3>Make sure the actors can sing the song in their sleep</h3>
<p>(And I&#8217;m not referring to dream sequences.)</p>
<p>They need to know the lyrics and the tune so well they can sing them backwards! Well, maybe not that well. (Yes, we can sing parts of Cheese Soufflé backwards.) They need to be able to sing the song at a moment&#8217;s notice and sing it well. Trust me on this one. As a director, it&#8217;s so frustrating when you lose every other take because the actor who is supposed to be lip-syncing can&#8217;t remember the words. As an actor, it&#8217;s very discouraging when you have to concentrate so hard on remembering the words that you forget little things like moving your mouth and singing to the other characters instead of the floor.</p>
<h3>Double check everything, but especially the batteries in your portable boom box</h3>
<p>We got caught with this one the day before we were going to film. No C batteries to be found in the house. And the adapter power cable for the cigarette lighter in the van wasn&#8217;t going to work.</p>
<h3>Streamline your storyboards</h3>
<p>If your number has been arranged as a whole song, and you&#8217;ve been practicing it as a whole song, try not to film it one verse at a time as you move the camera around. You lose your place very easily and get a lot of messed up entrances and exits. Things flow best if you do them the way they&#8217;ve been rehearsed. Set your actors up for success! Put the camera in position once and film the whole song. Move it to a secondary location and film the whole song. If you need an angle that&#8217;s weird enough . . . I mean, different enough that you only want one shot of it then it&#8217;s okay to just do a piece of the song. I&#8217;m not trying to force you into filming the whole song a gazillion times. Just keep your (and your actor&#8217;s) patience in mind.</p>
<h3>Make lists and prioritize</h3>
<p>Time constraints are not good friends of mine. In order to combat them efficiently we need two wonder weapons. Checklists and Plan Bs. Think about it. If you have a checklist that says:</p>
<p><em>Full Front Shot - entire song<br />
Close up on MC - entire song<br />
Close up on Secondary Character - verses 9, 10, and 12<br />
Wide Angle - verses 2 and 7<br />
Character reactions - entire song</em></p>
<p>You can hand it to virtually anyone and they can instantly become sub-directors for as long as you need! That will leave you free to think about other things. No worries about them missing an angle or a line. It&#8217;s all spelled out. The more detailed the better. Comprehensive lists are your friends. It takes prep work, but it&#8217;s totally worth it.</p>
<p>The other necessity is Plan B. Or Plan C. Or even clear through to Plan Z. (I have never personally gone that far.) If you think you&#8217;re going to run out of time to film all you had planned, what should you do? The actors and crew are waiting for you to suddenly tell them exactly what they need to be doing to make things work. Do you know what to tell them? Do you have the foggiest notion? Be prepared.<br />
If you know an actor has to leave part of the way through, film everything with him in it first. If you&#8217;re getting ready to film for an hour and you look at the clock and almost faint because you realized it took you a half hour to set up, how will you best redeem the situation? Film all the basic shots first?<br />
I think you get the idea. A little thinking ahead never hurt anyone. Just don&#8217;t turn your plans into a worst-case scenario survival kit. No need to flip out over something that might not happen.</p>
