Not much to look at by any measure &#8212; your quintessential back country town, set amid the arid and gently rolling landscape of rural Washington.

None of Montreal though, as it was still dark when I left, at 6 Eastern this morning. Even with my &#8220;simplified&#8221; flight plan, this has been a long, unproductive day. The sunrise over Lake Champlain was absolutely amazing though &#8212; the flight path from Montreal to NYC basically follows the lake from the NY shore, and luckily I was sitting on the left of the plane. It was still a bit dark when we passed Burlington, VT (of which I just found a batch of pictures dating back from this summer btw &#8212; a posty-post is a-coming) but it got really gorgeous when we got to the Ticonderoga / Saratoga area. Alas, no pictures, as I wasn&#8217;t quick enough to get up and get the camera.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; you need to wear flowers in your hair, c&#8217;est bien connu. Ce qui serait un probleme vu ce qu&#8217;il me reste de cheveux. Eh ben ca tombe bien, j&#8217;y vais pas, a SF. Du moins pas tout de suite (le trip de Noel tient toujours!). Je dis ca, parce qu&#8217;une certaine personne responsable des ventes m&#8217;a fait une fausse joie la semaine derniere en mentionnant un client en  Californie. La conversation a plus ou moins ete comme ca:<br />
- oh yeah, near San Fran maybe?<br />
- no, I forget the name&#8230;<br />
- in SoCal? LA area?<br />
- no, it&#8217;s not in a big city<br />
- um, Bakersfield? (to self &#8212; c&#8217;est quoi les chances d&#8217;avoir un client a Bakersfield, franchement?)<br />
- no, closer to Seattle I think&#8230;<br />
- &#8230; uh?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not sure if you&#8217;ve been following the financial news lately, but there&#8217;s a bit of a crisis in the air. Really, you should check it out.</p>
<p>My favourite part is when forex started going bananas, about three weeks ago.<br />
This is what the Loonie&#8217;s been up to lately:<br />
<img src='http://goyave.homedns.org/online/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/loonie-greenback.png' alt='Loonie vs Greenback' /><br />
No, this is not a temperature forecast for the next 10 days. That one looks much less depressing.</p>
<p>Now, this is painting a rather gloomy and misleading picture &#8212; actually we&#8217;re holding our own fairly well against a vast majority of foreign currencies. I hear we even made moderate gains against the AUD, NZD, and have pretty much held steady against the Euro.<br />
As a matter of fact, the only three currencies we&#8217;ve depreciated significantly against are the Greenback, the Yen and the Swiss Franc. This is not bad at all &#8212; 3 out of what, hundreds of currencies out there.</p>
<p>Only problem is, I&#8217;m currently in Switzerland, and going down twice to NYC and the Southwest by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Oy vey.<br />
(because any and all swearing in these times of financial hardship has to be in Yiddish)</p>

The bass player isn&#8217;t half bad either.




Love it when he picks up the keytar &#8212; unstoppable funk.
