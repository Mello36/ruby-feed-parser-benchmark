			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Meet <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/internet_utilities/addressbooksync.html">AddressBookSync</a>, a simple Mac-app created to synchronise pictures and trivial (birthday) data from Facebook with the local Address book the Mac. This is about as much as you could possibly get out of Facebook, without infringing on the terms of agreement that you agreed too (probably without reading) when signing up to Facebook.</p>
<p>And meet my other friend, LinkedIn&#8217;s <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/addressBookExport">AddressBookExport</a>, which allows me to place all of my contacts into the, again, more useful Address Book on the Mac. </p>
<p>Now, I can take that address book and import it back into Facebook. But I cannot do it the other way around.</p>
<p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/facebook-import-export-mail.jpg?w=466&#038;h=196" alt="Facebook import export mail.jpg" border="0" width="466" height="196" /></p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being too European about this, but it seems logical that this should be a law. These are your contacts; there&#8217;s a mutual agreement between both parties to come into contact. That same agreement might not exist regarding me importing their addresses into Facebook (Still have to read those TOCs), but Facebook still allows it.</p>
<p>We all get why they don&#8217;t allow the opposite. They don&#8217;t want me to take my contacts with me to some other social network. Because it isn&#8217;t a utility like LinkedIn, but more like a gym-membership, with lots of fun activities to do onsite. </p>
<p>But seriously, shouldn&#8217;t this be a law, and if so, why isn&#8217;t it being implemented?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>This is one the hardest things ever. While I was blogging daily it was easy; you somehow get into this rhythm of pumping out text everyday and, at some point, you&#8217;ve hit your groove. Taking <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/12/01/the-key-to-prolific-writing-part-3-take-breaks-and-be-inspired/">my break</a> really made little sense to my brain whatsoever, as day-after-day, I kept on writing draft-after-draft, while I was meant to take a break!!! </p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/vincentvw/status/1040470536"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/twitter-vincent-van-wylick-i-m-a-terrible-break-taker.jpg?w=500" alt="Twitter _ Vincent van Wylick_ I_m a terrible break-taker ....jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Luckily-unluckily I eventually gave that up…</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t actually thing there is any great secret to starting up again. It&#8217;s going to be a bitch, we all know that, and we can all remember that first workout in the gym / at home, after taking much-too-long-a break. <em>Muscle Ache!!!</em> Which in blogging-terms, translates to brain-ache or <em>have-I written-sh*t-today?</em>-ache. I know that, writing this, I will check back over and over and over again to see if it made any sense.</p>
<p>No, the real secret to starting up again is just… <em>to never stop!</em> Or, to continue like you never stopped and have faith in the imagined fact that someday that brain-ache is going to pass… even if it doesn&#8217;t feel like that right now.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow, Tech IT Easians!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Hi, this is not a technology report – analysis, so somehow out of the usual TIE dresscode.<br />
But I feel that I should blog about what is happening in my country Greece nowdays for all the impact that it has on a personal, national, European and human level.</p>
<p>Last Saturday night a teenager was shot by a policeman in the street.<br />
Ever since, Athens and many other Greek cities live in protesting, rioting, and worse, looting and burning of public and private urban tissue.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_riots">( details )</a></p>
<p>It is not the first time citizens fall pray to urban risks, neither in Greece nor in other cities of the world.  Reaction is always part of the game. But extending these reactions over a surreal period of several days, signifies that the game is still a subject of negotiation under the sound of anger.</p>
<p>For me, and for many other people living here, it is a strangling of our logic.<br />
It is only by focusing on each incident separately that we can form a vision on the facts.<br />
Whoever tries to see these past days as whole, is faced with profound stress because there is no connecting line, typical of violence, eh?<br />
So instinctively each part of the population identifies his reason with his own anxiety in this massive crowdsourcing of hate colours.</p>
<p>for example&#8230;<br />
<span style="color:#000000;">Teenagers face their economically and socially undermined environment.<br />
Students and people who enter the productive ages face the paradox of building a life in one of the most expensive European countries by means of parental mecenat.<br />
People in their 50s revive their <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/greece-in-turmoil-riots-and-politics">post-war issues</a>.<br />
Pensioners stress the absence of social welfare.<br />
Artists reason on cultural sins like sleep and obesity.</span><br />
A big happy extended family …</p>
<p>Life in Greece is beautiful, most of the time you feel as if it is a party. If it is not in the air, it lives in the minds of the people.</p>
<p>Sometimes people get drunk. In 2004 we were drunk by the sudden euphoria of the Olympic Games, and in the aftermath we kept on the festivities (very bad for our credit card reflexes)<br />
In 2008 we are drunk with anger.<br />
This is a good kick to begin bringing to reality what we have in our minds. And start building.<br />
Soon, when the violence will be over, we will have no illusion if burning everything down could have been a solution.<br />
A big “NO” will be stuck in our minds hopefully.<br />
And hopefully our animal farm is short-circuited here.</p>
<div id="attachment_1492" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1492" title="100_3116" src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/100_3116.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="me &amp; my friends, after" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">me &amp; my friends, after</p></div>
<p>With or without Mr Jones we will be more ready to build what we want for Greece.<br />
First thing is to put in action some <a href="http://www.peacedirect.org/resources/books/Making_Terrorism_History_Book.html">conciliation practices </a>and rebuild our public safety mechanisms.<br />
Instead of overeducating kindergarteners and pappy-students, getting our guardian angels to learn the basics.<br />
And then begin reintegrating them in the society, which has fiercely stereotyped and dehumanized them.</p>
<p>And then reintegrating ourselves in the society.</p>
<p>And then working for it and not against it.</p>
<p>We all now that, either in Greece or in other parts of the planet.  now it&#8217;s time to begin <strong>doing</strong> it&#8230;</p>
<p>no grande finale in this article, because I will sound even more like a third class politician.</p>
<p>+ behind the violence, there were also some interesting stuff on how people communicated during the crisis, I will blog about them soon, when I find my words back.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><em>Previously on this blog, <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/11/21/learning-java-as-a-beginner/">Vincent talked about learning Java</a>. That reminded me of this post that I had kept as a draft for a very long time. It&#8217;s more like a (really) short story, though. I guess it just a love story about Ruby and perils of having too much time on your hands.</em></p>
<p>I have a confession. I recently wrote a program, or maybe it&#8217;s just a script. I&#8217;m a bit ashamed to confess this, because it serves little if any purpose.</p>
<p>You see, one group of my friends hang at this irc-channel where they post occasionally funny links. The problem, of course, is that you&#8217;d need a connection to <a title="IRC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> to see what&#8217;s going on in the channel and IRC is usually blocked at any public or work access points. It&#8217;s also a pain to keep track of all the links unless you&#8217;re online all the time, 24/7.</p>
<p>So, having some time on my hands, I started writing a little Ruby program that would parse the <a title="irssi" href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a> logs for all links and publish the latest ones as an <a title="Atom" href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">Atom</a>/RSS feed. Thanks to the open source movement, it was easy to find a library, <a title="atom-tools" href="http://code.necronomicorp.com/trac/atom-tools">atom-tools</a>, that would do the heavy lifting of writing out the XML of an Atom feed. I decided writing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> to parse the logs was enough so I could say I had actually done something myself.</p>
<p>It was fun. And I got to use <a title="Transmit" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> and love its feature-I-now-can&#8217;t-live-without Edit With &lt;editor here&gt;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>?&#8221;, you might ask. Because it&#8217;s the only language, which syntax I remember and to which I remember where the documentation is (thanks <a title="RDoc" href="http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/">RDoc</a> ). Publishing this little gem (in figurative sense, not as a <a title="ruby gem" href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/">ruby gem</a>) on my friend&#8217;s server pointed once again the blocking problem of Ruby. My friend&#8217;s Debian box had an outdated version of Ruby and when I finally (okay, it took a day after I hinted about that) got him to update that it was still missing IRB (Ruby&#8217;s interactive shell). Debian doesn&#8217;t like rubygems, so I had to add atom-tools library the hard way. Running the script on Apache through something like mod_ruby or mod_fcgi or something? I chose to run the script as a cron job instead. Deploying my little ruby script was a pain. Had I written a php, python or perl script I would&#8217;ve no doubt avoided some of the obstacles, but my main idea was not to actually have a script converting irssi logs to feeds, but enjoying writing a program, i.e. coding.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t satisfied after the script started to write out every hour the latest links on our irc-channel. There were so many features I could add to it! I could make it so that instead of just linking to an image, it could also display the image as inline content! <a title="I could make it better! I could make it faster! I have the technology!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man#Opening_Sequence">I could make it better! I could make it faster! I have the technology!</a></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the code. It wasn&#8217;t poetry, but the source was still&#8230; ugly. I wanted to make little classes out of everything. Make it more general and modular. To give rhythm to the code. (I blame myself for reading <a title="The Ruby Way" href="http://rubyhacker.com/coralbook/">The Ruby Way</a>).</p>
<p>I was over-engineering. The script was done. It did what I had wanted it to do. But I wasn&#8217;t satisfied, I wanted more. There were still bugs to fix.</p>
<p><em>If you have a burning desire to parse links out of your irssi logs with Finnish dates in timestamps, the code is available &#8230; at request.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Previously Vincent wrote about <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/11/28/collaborative-filtering-is-it-better-to-weigh-user-input-or-expert-input/">collaborative filtering</a> here on Tech It Easy and made a really good business case on the topic of user-generated content (UGC) versus Expert input. Here, I’ll go a bit more deep into the ways collaborative filtering is done and what are the challenges.</p>
<p>For simplicity, I have divided the ways to filter in two. There’s the <a href="http://www.pandora.com/mgp.shtml">Pandora way</a>, where the approach is that a song can be explained by about 150 different genes and recommendations are (in very simple terms) other songs in the neighborhood in that multi-dimensional space. To accurately achieve this, they use expert opinions. Then there’s the Amazon, Last.fm, Netflix et al. way of clustering users with similar histories and recommending what other people in that cluster have liked.</p>
<p>The huge difference in these approaches is best illustrated by the fact that for the Pandora way to work, you don’t actually need any users. The expert’s role in the latter way is to somehow come up with a way to model these clusters accurately.</p>
<p>The latter is much more interesting, because it’s always a challenge to infer anything from user data. The Pandora way’s “only” major challenge is the assumption that people like similar things (ie. how big the searched neighborhood should be).</p>
<p>The other main reason for interest in the Amazon/Netflix way is, of course, money. The $ 1,000,000 <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/leaderboard">Netflix Prize</a> is, simply put, a hunt for a certain RMSE (root mean squared error). When described this way, some interesting questions arise.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_1477" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 180px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1477 " title="Napoleon Dynamite" src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/napoleon-dynamite-played-by-john-heder.jpg?w=170&#038;h=209" alt="For the record, I liked Napoleon Dynamite" width="170" height="209" /><p class="wp-caption-text">For the record, I liked Napoleon Dynamite</p></div>
<p>One question I think is important is what’s the theoretical limit for accuracy in Netflix’s case. In other words, let’s assume that all users at Netflix rate fully rationally all and only the movies they have seen on a cardinal scale. That’s a pretty heavy load of assumptions and I’m pretty sure that’s not all. That’s why even though Netflix could accurately forecast the <em>data</em> it wouldn’t mean it mirrors users’ <em>true preferences</em>. So, what actually is this upper limit on accuracy, or lower limit on RMSE, in Netflix’s case is a good question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For these reasons it shouldn’t be surprising that “just a guy in a garage”, a psychologist employing behavioral decision making assumptions instead of hard rationality, could get so good scores in the Netflix Prize. <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/16-03/mf_netflix">A pretty good story on that was in Wired a while ago</a>.</p>
<p>For the reasons above, it’s also pretty backwards to think that the problem is fitting the data into the algorithm, so I wouldn’t really call it a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23Netflix-t.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">“Napoleon Dynamite problem”</a> as NY Times did recently. But do note, that the “Pragmatic Theory” team interviewed in this article, just like “just a guy in a garage”, didn’t actually invent anything new, they just realized to use a method didn’t know or had forgotten about, in this case singular value decomposition. One such method is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_components_analysis">Principal Component Analysis</a>, which is available in pretty much any statistical software package available (no, Excel doesn’t count) (and yes, could think Pandora way as something similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis">Factor analysis</a>).</p>
<p>One difficulty in Netflix’s case it pretty much boils down to what’s in a number. Remember that in this case the teams work only on user rating data, but they are of course free to add more data from other sources as well. This doesn’t change the fact that the only user data they have are user’s ratings.</p>
<blockquote><p>As a sidenote, I guess that one reason demographics aren’t used is legal issues. Vince pointed that things like the “Napoleon Dynamite problem” could be solved with more data like demographics and mood. Now, usually more data means just more problems, but let’s forget about that for this discussion.</p>
<p>On this topic, I recently listened to a really interesting lecture about modern consumer analysis by Petri Vasara from <a href="http://www.poyry.com">Pöyry consulting</a>. They had come up with neat tool, ConsuNaut (<a href="http://www.noldus.com/mb2008/individual_papers/SIG_Theuws/SIG_Theuws_Vasara.pdf">PDF</a>) to show what certain segments are doing at what times (comparing to the old “your target audience watches TV x hours day” way) and what was their mood etc. One <a href="http://www.dimes.fi/en/news/press_archive?Article=32">“press release friendly” finding</a> of this tool is that the Global Rush Hour, or when most of the world’s people are commuting, is at 18-19 Finnish time (UTC+2).</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, back to the topic. What I also see as a problem is the actual “forecasting” part. Now, this doesn’t affect Netflix that much, because I assume that it is in their interest to get customers rent whatever movies, even - using the out-of-fashion term - “long tail”. Even more so if there are inventory costs involved. What happens when a new movie enters the pool? Remember, that for clustering to work, there has to be data, which is pretty sparse for a new movie. How long does it take for new movie’s recommendations to be accurate and how does it affect other recommendations?</p>
<p>In other words, how stable is the solution for the problem? How does seeing the latest James Bond, because everyone goes to see that, change the recommendations to someone who doesn’t like other action movies? Is he recommended Transporter 2? Is fan of Pixar movies offered Disney’s <em>children’s</em> animations, or worse yet, <em>DreamWorks’</em> animations?</p>
<div id="attachment_1480" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 172px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1480" title="Wall-E" src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/walle1.jpg?w=162&#038;h=240" alt="Wall-E" width="162" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Not Madagascar 2</p></div>
<p>So, while Netflix way is about fitting data and finding clusters, Pandora bases it assumption on the idea that all music can be labeled accurately and objectively. The main criticism against this approach in my opinion is the post-modern philosophy of subjectiveness. Is there really one truth? (Also, how many genes does it need?)</p>
<p>I was attending a guest lecture by Andrzej P. Wierzbicki on “The Problem of Objective Ranking: Foundations, Approaches and Applications”, where he, for example, discussed the “dangers and errors of the subjectivist reduction of objectivity to power and money”. So he was painting with a broad brush, but there were lots of gems. He also noted that intersubjective rational ranking is difficult and full objectivity is impossible, which should demotivate the Pandora crowd a little.</p>
<p>So, what might at surface look like a statistical challenge is deep down much more cross-disciplinary and it goes all the way to our assumptions of reality. This is why it is important to keep in mind the most important thing, the end of all this – the business angle. It is not Netflix’s or Pandora’s interest to 100% accurately predict anything, they only need to do it well enough. Well, not Netflix’s anyway. The whole reason for improving Cinematch is purely economical, they have found out that people actually rent more if the recommendations are good (enough). There’s a reason they’re offering one million dollars for 10% improvement. I’d love to know how quickly that million pays itself back.</p>
<p>And, really, let’s face it. Most of the collaborative filtering things today are just toys so none of this really matters. There’s a lot of assumptions and approximations and the results are good enough for the purpose. For example, iTunes’ Genius is certainly flawed and limited, but it’s way better than normal random or shuffle play. But if you want to go that extra mile, then you see that the challenge gets exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p>To top it off, in the end there’s the age old problem of optimization, which is that on average, the solutions are “good”, but not “interesting” and definitely not varied. But to add “interestingness” we have to add uncertainty and that’s whole new world of pain (<a href="http://www.sfb504.uni-mannheim.de/glossary/allais.htm">Allais paradox</a> being the least)… but risk should have its rewards, shouldn’t it?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Setting-Sound-Business-Goals/dp/0471386545/?tag=reviewrus-20"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CAXPB5D8L._SL500_AA240_.jpg" width="250" align="right"></a>In many ways, I consider this the best strategy book, I&#8217;ve ever read. &#8220;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Setting-Sound-Business-Goals/dp/0471386545/?tag=reviewrus-20">Valuation</a></em>,&#8221; by George Norton, is, as the name suggests, a book that uses financial models as a basis to build (sound) strategies. It is also a textbook—my version is hardcover and 190 pages long—but written in a format that reads easily and is structured to be implemented—ca. 30% of the book are (group-)exercises meant to implement what the book suggests.</p>
<p>If I had to criticise it, it&#8217;s that I don&#8217;t consider it very practical in an entrepreneurial setting. One thing that such methodologies require, is <em>time</em>, which is often a luxury that smaller/younger companies and projects do not have. Building up a set of co-ordinated, organisation-wide strategies can be a matter of years, and, I expect that if you were to follow the book&#8217;s advice, you&#8217;d engage in a 6 month trajectory, at least.</p>
<p>That said, it is a well-written book and achieves the objective of a book, which is to make understood its topic. In this case, <em>valuation</em> means understanding the value of companies, their products, and business activities. The financial part only really plays a part in the first third and last third of the book, while the middle is more about the actual coming up of the company&#8217;s mission, its broader goals, its objectives, and its strategies—the latter being the nitty-gritty activities of how to fulfil the grander vision. </p>
<p>And, where valuation comes in, everything will affect the cash position of the business: some activities may be research-intensive (= costly), but lead to greater rewards in the long-term; others will be quick-sale actions, which generate revenue, but may not always improve the long-term position of the business, unless that revenue is re-invested in more sustainable growth. </p>
<p>I find that these principles easily translate into small business- and individual activities, but only if taken on a holistic level, in which case reading this book may be overkill. But if you&#8217;re a finance-geek that wants to learn how to better translate the numbers into practical company-activities, or, vice versa, if you&#8217;re a creative business-person, who wants a relatively easy intro into the financial fundamentals behind strategies, then this book may be for you.</p>

It is used by sites/web-apps, like <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a>, <a href="http://pandora.com">Pandora Radio</a>, and <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>, and, I think, <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/26/ulikenet-on-community-culture/">Ulik</a>, and mostly based on user-generated content.</p>
<p>Just working it out logically, you could say several things about <strong>user-generated content</strong>:
<ol>
<li>there&#8217;s a lot of it, but attention is limited to a few leading sites</li>
<li>not all users are equal, there are demographic, emotional, intelligence, and other factors that affect how users vote.</li>
<li>users are cheap, which also sometimes means that you get what you paid for.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m personally not a fan of user-generated content, at least on a massive scale, because of some of the things in that list. </p>
<p>Alternative is the <strong>expert-based method</strong>, which means that expert-critics analyse a product and give it a rating. It is not often used in a collaborative setting, meaning that it makes suggestions for other products, i.e. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> or <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> would be sites collect expert input, but don&#8217;t, afaik, suggest other matching movies. </p>
<p>The most famous example of an <em>expert-based collaborative filtering system</em> is Pandora Radio, which is built on top of the <a href="http://www.pandora.com/mgp.shtml">Music Genome Project</a>, a collection of 50-or-so music-experts that analyse music and assign attributes to it. Those attributes can then be used to match songs. Users&#8217; input isn&#8217;t ignored, they can vote on songs, which affects their future track-lists.</p>
<p>A few characteristics of expert-based systems are:
<ol>
<li>They entail significant wage-costs for employees that have invested in their expertise. Counter this against the possible income of a service like Pandora—advertising &amp; referral-fees—and there could be a discrepancy.</li>
<li>They cannot rate as much content, as quickly, as a more user-generated system could.</li>
<li>They, on the other hand, maintain a consistent quality, that is unmatched by the varying quality that comes out of user-input.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m personally much more of a fan of an expert-based system, but sceptical of its economic merit, looking just at point 1.</p>
<p>Most systems seem to be orientated at users mainly, which, if you have a <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">dataset like Netflix&#8217;s</a>, is a smart way to go about things. There are some limitations that that entails, as the Netflix prize has revealed, namely that it <a href="http://kottke.org/08/11/the-netflix-prize-and-the-case-of-the-napoleon-dynamite-problem">cannot account for &#8220;strange&#8221; films</a> like &#8220;Napoleon Dynamite,&#8221; and that it doesn&#8217;t take into account any user-based information, such as demographics or mood.</p>
<p>What do you think, audience? Knowing that users are cheap but a-plenty (but also overwhelmed with competing attention-buckets), and experts are few and expensive, is the solution to still go the user-generated route and try to make that work? In my opinion, expert-based systems require different business models than are popular online these days. You cannot get away with charging <em>nothing</em>, expecting users to magically click your advert, and hope to pay those university-educated experts. That, or, the margins for your products have to be so high (e.g. insurance &amp; travel), to make such a system work (not that I think collaborative filtering and insurance really make that much sense—&#8221;<em>give me the insurance radio-station please!</em>&#8220;… eh no.)</p>
<p>Enjoy the weekend!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/new-venture-deadlines.jpg?w=300" alt="New Venture - Deadlines.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />A lot more multi-part blog posts on Tech IT Easy; finally some continuity again, which is nice for both you and me! So, today was the ceremony for stage 1 of the <a href="http://www.newventure.nl">New Venture business-plan competition</a>, the submission of the idea, of which a prize of €500 was to be won by 10 contestants. As I <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/11/04/some-brief-reflections-on-the-new-venture-business-plan-competition/">expected</a>, for several reasons, I wasn&#8217;t among those 10, though the race isn&#8217;t over yet! The next submission is February 26th 2009, the <a href="http://www.newventure.nl/en/about/deadlines/round2">feasibility-study</a>, for which I may compete with my own idea or change it (to another, if needed). The feasibility of an idea entails technological and business aspects, and there&#8217;s still a lot to be worked out on both ends. I&#8217;m letting you know for completely selfish ends—it would be nice to see a familiar face, if only on the other side of the court. Of course, one team-member must be residing in the Netherlands! </p>
<p>So how was today? I wasn&#8217;t really top-fit as it feels like I&#8217;m doing a 101 things and am a little overwhelmed, i.e. stressed out. So I didn&#8217;t come with high expectations, mostly to check out the competition and perhaps meet some people. The event was presented by Roland Koopman, a Dutch TV-presentor, and the awards were handed out by Pim Batist, founder of <a href="http://www.sellaband.com/">SellaBand</a>. </p>
<p>Two &#8220;insider&#8221;-stories were presented, one was SellaBand and other was <a href="http://www.taniq.com/"><strong>Taniq</strong></a>, a rubber-company, for lack of a better word—the company makes it so that rubber hoses and similar are more stable, while using less materials and no metal. You should check out the film their site, it&#8217;s very well-made. Most important insight from Taniq: the importance of coaches/mentors, which appear to be abundant if you take part in the competition, for bouncing off ideas &amp; solving problems. But also on the hiring process—when the three young founders decided to look for some &#8220;grey haired&#8221; commercial talent, they found out, the hard way, that big-company sales-talent is not the same as small-company talent. In the end, if you can&#8217;t sell your own products as an entrepreneur, you&#8217;re probably in trouble!</p>
<p>The best example of this was perhaps Pim Betist; what a magnetic personality! <strong>SellaBand</strong> is a crowdfunding mechanism for bands, who, instead of walking to a  record-company (for whatever reason), can place themselves on the site, after which fans can vote—<em>with their wallets!</em>—for the band they like. And with that a music-cd, etc. can be produced… He came up with the idea in 2001, residing in New York. Then, for reasons unexplained, he decided to take on a 3-year job at Shell, until he finally quit that job, sold his car, moved into some (illegally) free housing and focussed all his energy on working out the idea. He recruited a guy from Sony BMG as co-founder, by posing as a student wanting to write a thesis and holding several meetings with the company under that subterfuge—a side-note: recruiting people from Sony should never be hard, these guys, from my experience, are all chronically made unhappy by the politics in that company. I&#8217;m a little more into music over rubber, as you can tell, but that&#8217;s maybe also because the presentation was excellent. Not that Taniq didn&#8217;t have a nice movie either, definitely to be watched on their site!</p>
<p>So what about <strong>the winners</strong>? If there was a definite theme to the evening, apart from innovation, it was that pretty much all of the prize-winnars had <em>a sustainable idea</em>. It wasn&#8217;t necessary green, but more efficient, more ethical, more social, etc. What I remembered was:
<ul>
<li>a one-handed fire-extinguisher for handicapped people</li>
<li>a crowd-funded electrical cart for people in third world countries</li>
<li>a way to make fuel consumption more efficient in cars</li>
<li>a sensor that measures how people sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>On the off-chance that you <em>are</em> planning to take part in round 2 (send me a <a href="mailto:vincent.vanwylick [at] gmail">mail</a>, if interested), that should give you a hint of where to direct some energy at! Looking at the credit crisis now, it should perhaps not be a surprise that attention is being drawn towards both efficiency, but also more sustainable ways of doing things—that is, incidentally, one the conditions that will probably be imposed on the car-companies, if they receive financial aid: to become more  green. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s it from me on this subject! It&#8217;s not too far a leap for me to write a feasibility study, but I&#8217;ll only know for certain if I&#8217;ll take part a few months from now. So, let&#8217;s hope for a part 3, 4, and beyond!</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>The point of this mini-series is to vocalise some of my thoughts about the creative writing process, which is something I only think about when I write every day, but not when I only write sporadically. I wrote this post last week Thursday, which illustrate its point perfectly. Another key to prolific writing is scheduling &amp; bundling related tasks. Why?
<ul>
<li>For one, blogging isn&#8217;t a job, and if it is, it usually isn&#8217;t a good job. You blog when you <strong>find the time</strong>.</li>
<li>Second, <strong>bundling similar tasks</strong> is easier than interrupting other ones. When I write, I&#8217;m &#8220;<em>in the zone</em>,&#8221; so why not write multiple posts instead of one.</li>
<li>Three, <strong>ideas come and go</strong> when they please. I sometimes wake up at 3 a.m. with an idea and just need to write it down. I don&#8217;t go, &#8220;oh I&#8217;ll just write it tomorrow,&#8221; because by that time my creative influx has usually gone.</li>
<li>Four, <strong>researching complex posts can be time-intensive</strong> and sometimes happens weeks in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, a good book to <em>read</em>  (<a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/11/17/how_to_blog_more/">part 1</a>) about the idea of getting into the zone, is Neil Fiore&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/0874775043/?tag=reviewrus-20">The Now Habit</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>On the note of <strong>research</strong>, I drew the below graphic about a year ago, trying to visualise how I research and write for a blog (in this case, <a href="http://foodandretail.blogspot.com">Food &#8216;n&#8217; Retail</a>). I personally think it only works when you take research very, very seriously (which you should, but which also takes time). And yes, it&#8217;s also the way I visualise innovation in firms, very much inspired by <em>portfolio management</em>, which I wrote about <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/09/06/palm-cancels-the-foleo-a-case-of-bad-portfolio-management/">before</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/skitched-20081127-105405.jpg?w=393&#038;h=367" alt="skitched-20081127-105405.jpg" border="0" width="393" height="367" /></p>
<p>Three horizons, obviously, the first being where its all still one big mess which you run into (or which is where you purposefully direct your energy at). Second, comes the processing phase where you&#8217;re trying to organise all that raw data into something useful. Third, comes the moment when the world sees your stuff and responds to it. That essentially feeds back into the organisation to produce future goods that are better. In a blogging context, that is the main reason why I value comments so much, though I&#8217;m also conflicted about them—a topic for a future post perhaps. </p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve gone a little beyond the intended scope of this post. But it also illustrates that any project, be it prolific writing, or the prolific creation of any kind of art of product, requires some serious planning behind it, i.e. the timing and combining of activities for a consistent outcome.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://www.choosyosx.com/images/choosy_cards.png" width="250" align="right"><a href="http://www.choosyosx.com"><strong>Choosy</strong></a> is Mac software, currently in beta, and works as follows: <em>when you click a link… it let&#8217;s you choose what browser to open it with.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly not a typical user, but browsers hijack my time in a number of ways. For one, I tend to have a lot of tabs open in them. If the browser is running, that means that I don&#8217;t want to close it; if it is closed and a tab-saving feature is enabled, I&#8217;m hesitant to open it. Not closing a browser with many tabs, means that your browser gets heavier and heavier. Having many saved tabs, means that opening a browser will be slower and slower. Another, less prevalent thing, is extensions. I no longer use Firefox on a day-to-day basis, but when I did, the more extensions I had installed (and they can be  so addictive), the slower that browser would get.</p>
<p>The consequence of the many-tabs problem is that I tend to use <em>different</em> browsers at different times. On the Mac, my no. 1 browser is Safari, because it&#8217;s the fastest to start. Camino is no. 2, because it&#8217;s faster (to start) than Firefox. Firefox is no. 3, and was, until recently, browser non grata (Firefox 3 has been a massive improvement). And I now use them interchangeably, according to which has the least tabs in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> is a big aid in browser-management for me; having each browser attached to a keyboard-trigger, means that I can quickly launch one of them as needed. But it didn&#8217;t solve one problem for me, which is the default-setting in OS X. You can only set <em>one</em> browser as your default, which means that when you click a link in any other app, it will open my default, Safari (even if that is currently browser non grata). </p>
<p>And that is the problem that <a href="http://www.choosyosx.com">Choosy</a> solves for me and perhaps for you too. And even cooler perhaps, you can set it up to open the link in the browser you are currently running. It&#8217;s still in beta (there are actually some bugs), and will eventually be be pay-ware, but test it out and you can get a discount.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the end-all-problems solution for me, but it&#8217;s definitely a good step forward.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/approaches-to-search-1.jpg?w=250" alt="approaches to search-1.jpg" border="0" width="250" align="right" />Looked at two new (for me) search-engines this week, <a href="http://www.cuil.com/">Cuil</a> (pronounced cool) and <a href="http://keyboardr.com/">Keyboardr</a>. Keyboardr is a geek-project and, like Mac&#8217;s <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>, is all about navigating via a keyboard. Cuil, which I had heard of before, I was made re-aware of by a recent <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2053">Stanford entrepreneurial thought leaders podcast</a>, in which its creation and the theory behind it was discussed. I liked the idea of approaching search as a visual placement problem, as that is how humans (in my opinion) often judge information. Still, I didn&#8217;t think that Cuil was particularly innovative, from a GUI perspective. Even so, all interesting projects, as is <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a>—human powered search. </p>
<p>What remains clear is Google will continue to be the thought-leader in this field, not because it is a better search, but because it is so integrated with the web. </p>
<p>What I&#8217;m thinking about is how search can be improved to become useful for human beings, rather than search-engine optimised websites, and the key to that seems to me to be presenting information in the right way for the right person.</p>
<p>Take Java tutorials, which I was looking for last week and where my priority was to find a. the right tutorial for my beginner-level and b. be taught by a good teacher. Two elements that matter here are level and quality, of which the first is easy to search for—just insert &#8216;beginner&#8217;—but the latter is currently being solved by Google as follows: the more it is linked too, the better it must be, which also makes sense. But it does ignore an element, discussed in the Stanford podcast, which is that unknown teachers can both be bad, but also exceptionally good. </p>
<p>Education online is different from education offline. The latter, if good, will be very popular, but interested people will run into a physical constraint—only so many students fit in that building. Online education, if good, will also be very popular but not have the same physical constraints, though possibly imposed price-based ones. But since we are talking good old open source Java, let us assume that price is not a factor. If everyone picks the most linked tutorial, which is also of good quality, it means that everyone potentially ends up with the same knowledge. The commoditisation of code. </p>
<p>But how do you produce exceptional Java-coders? These are arguably all people that walked the extra mile, either through inner potential and/or through environmental factors, such as an exceptional teacher. There&#8217;s another factor, which is that diversity can also breed innovation, by exposing people to a wide variety of ideas and perspectives, again made possibly by people working with a wide variety of tutors. Still talking Java here, but it could be applied to anything.</p>
<p>Search, in other words, promotes mediocrity, by leading people to pick the most common denominator, the top-result, <em>rather</em> than across the wideband of possible results, made possibly by the widely hyped up &#8220;long-tailed&#8221; nature of the internet.</p>
<p>And that is <em>one</em> problem that search is currently facing. How this is solved, is possibly a GUI solution, by presenting results in the right way and right variety. It could also be a human solution, such the one used by Mahalo. It could be a user-generated solution, using social-based variables through sites like Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2008/11/24/announcing-linkedins-new-search-platform/">now LinkedIN</a>, and something that Google is also implementing (<a href="http://www.google.nl/search?q=techcrunch+google+search+wiki&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">badly, I hear</a>). It could be a technological solution, something Cuil is also working on… etc. etc.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, that Keyboardr, no matter how geeky and cool, won&#8217;t exactly solve this problem <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<blockquote><em>Discipline is the mother of all innovation…!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to dedicate one hour per day to learning <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a>. If I remember correctly, Jeremy did <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/01/31/2-resolutions-for-2007-visit-a-cluster-of-innovation-every-year-brush-up-my-programming-skills/#comments">something similar</a>, but I&#8217;m not sure it was for this language. Reasons for doing this are:
<ul>
<li><em>A good intro-language for code-dummies like me!</em></li>
<li><em>Built to be cross-platform</em>: not only PC-wise, but on mobiles as well (I plan to write about the latter in a future post).</li>
<li><em>Plenty of resources around</em> (more in this in a sec)!</li>
<li><em>The intellectual challenge!</em></li>
<li><em>Necessity</em>: remember my last mantra?</li>
</ul>
<p>After looking around for resources, of which there is no shortage, I&#8217;ve decided on a three-pronged approach:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>lecture-series</strong>, by Swinburne University of Technology, entitled &#8220;Object Orientated Programming&#8221; (free on <a href="http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/swin.edu.au.1637659730.01637659732">iTunes U</a>)</li>
<li>A <strong>book</strong>, called &#8220;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009205/index.html">Head First Java, 2nd Edition</a>,&#8221; which got good reviews on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/?tag=reviewrus-20">Amazon</a>, and is co-authored by Kathy Sierra. The lecture above recommends, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-8th-Sun/dp/0132354764/?tag=reviewrus-20">Core Java, Volume 1</a>,&#8221; which I have to see whether that would make sense to get, in order to follow what they are saying.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise-tutorials</strong>, to learn the basics, of which there is no shortage online. I am currently a third of the way with the tutorials on <a href="http://javaomatic.com/">Javaomatic</a>, and will see what happens afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t like working solo on things, I think a logical next step is to take part in projects where I can practice my l33t haXing skillZ as well as contribute on the business developmental side. </p>
<p>My questions to the audience are:
<ol>
<li>Where do you stand on Java as a language and as a standard? Personally, I have yet to come across a Java-app that I actually use day-to-day.</li>
<li>What is the <strong>one</strong> Java app that I should check out to inspire me!?</li>
<li>How easy is it to build on top of Java and learn/use other languages? What web-languages are most related to Java (yes, I am aware that Java could be a considered a web-language also)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy the weekend!<br />

<ul>
<li>Originality is zero and copycats are a-plenty</li>
<li>Ideas are worth nothing unless they can be and are acted upon</li>
<li>The early bird catches the worm</li>
<li>Passive research is good, active testing is better</li>
<li>With customers, everything else falls into place, so sell-sell-sell !</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this tell you about starting a business? That you, as an entrepreneur, should be in a place where two things happen quickly: technology being developed and the market being developed. If the market is there, but missing the tech: <em>develop the tech!</em> If the tech is there, but missing the market: <em>develop the market!</em></p>
<p>With those deceptively simple words, I&#8217;ll leave you, but before I do, a brief note about my mantra-series: <em>With them, I am essentially developing an entrepreneurial philosophy, which I am encouraging you to share and criticise. To repeat, <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/11/14/entrepreneurial-mantra-have-your-revenue-model-prove-your-business-idea/">mantra 1</a> was: get paid for what you do, rather than making that a secondary issue. Mantra 2 is: have the skills and resources to act quickly when you need to act. This particular recession, for instance, which has barely got started and will truly hit us in 2009, pushes this point home particularly strongly.</em></p>

<p>The question on everybody&#8217;s lips is, why didn&#8217;t Apple do this? Your first hint: look at the way the guy is <em>standing</em>. Few people use their PCs in that position. </p>
<p>I tried emulating the feeling a little, by making stupid gestures in front of my laptop. I&#8217;m pretty fit, but it did get annoying after a while. Having a touch-screen at 90 degrees, half a meter in front of you, is inelegant. </p>
<p>The reason the keyboard + mouse combo work so well is because it&#8217;s actually within perfect and comfortable reach by the human body. You sit, your arms bend, and you use. Like the picture below, which is the ideal typing position, as taken from <a href="http://www.yale.edu/ergo/elements.htm">Yale&#8217;s Ergonomics website</a>. Vs. the Touchscreen, where you would sit, extend your arms and use. </p>

<p>The perfect touch-screen would actually be similar to an architect&#8217;s table, like on the picture below. Note that Jeff Han, godly inventor of all things multi-touch-screens, also has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKqyn-gUbY">similar set-up</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/architect-table.jpg?w=288&#038;h=434" alt="architect table.jpg" border="0" width="288" height="434" /></p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Apple do something like this? My guess is three-fold.
<ol>
<li>The market is still pretty small (designers, etc.?).</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not really that amazing an innovation—as an average user, can you really do that much more with a touch-screen, vs. a keyboard + mouse? </li>
<li>And where are the manufacturing economies of scope? I made this point <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/01/16/i-love-how-apples-logistics-work/">before</a>, when I noted how many overlaps there on the component level for different Apple-products: a big e.g. the 13&#8243; screen, which is now used by 3 product-lines. If Apple did this for one product-line, it would probably want to translate it to the other ones as well… but how would that work?</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think? Will we be seeing an Apple touch-<em>PC</em> (note: I say PC, not iPhone XL, which is more probable), and, if so, in what format? Also state if you&#8217;re thinking as a consumer or as a prosumer!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Dear readers,</p>
<p>These last few weeks, months, you will have noticed that content on Tech IT Easy has mainly been provided by me, Vincent, with sporadic, but much appreciated interjections by other bloggers. Why this is the case differs for every person on this blog and I will not go into those reasons.</p>
<p>When this blog was started by Jeremy Fain, it came out of his vision, one which he expanded into building a group-blog, which, for a long time now, has managed to stay alive. Now that I&#8217;m the main blogger here, however, I find myself somewhat conflicted with following that vision, which I&#8217;ve always seen being focussed on the tech and business space (with some other content interjected). </p>
<p>My background is <em>a</em>-similar to Jeremy, because I don&#8217;t have the tech-education and other experiences that he has enjoyed. Rather I am an international citizen, with a passion for innovation and business, as well as plenty of other stuff, and I am able put a few words together about these topics. That said, my work and interests also take me out of the tech-space much of the time, which makes writing about tech more of a hypothetical exercise than anything else.</p>
<p>So I ask those of you that read this blog what you would prefer from my part. Would you prefer that I continue as I have, writing about anything that comes to mind, with the occasional tech-component? Or would you prefer less updates from me on Tech IT Easy (in which case, I will re-open my personal blog) and the occasional blogpost about tech and/or business?</p>
<p>Please answer the following poll to give me an insight, thanks!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>One of the first thesis topics that was proposed to me, as part of my strategic management master, was to research why companies are located where they are. Turned out that this is some super-secret thing and there hardly is any data on it. Our assumption was that this must hence be strategically significant. </p>
<p>I abandoned the project, after making this super-complex mindmap about it. I decided,  I just wasn&#8217;t interested enough in the topic and that the reason was probably a very boring thing, like taxes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8113895/Strategic-Alignment-and-Location-Choice"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/strategic-alignment-and-location-choice.jpg?w=500" alt="strategic alignment and location choice.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday, I had a pretty cool meeting with a software-company that has been running successfully for about 10 years. Only it was in the middle of nowhere, close to some Dutch village that you will never have heard of. After the meeting, I asked why on earth they had located there (no thesis-related motive at all)!? Turns out that when you start a company and start hiring locally, your loyal employees won&#8217;t be so loyal anymore if you decide to move to e.g. Amsterdam (about 2 hours away).</p>
<p>Sometimes the simplest answer can be hidden under a lot of complexity…</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>From Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders, <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2049">a lecture by Mohr Davidow Ventures partner, Erik Straser</a>, on innovation in Clean Tech:<br />
<blockquote>…As you&#8217;re thinking about what you&#8217;re going do, the no. 1 thing I would advise you is how to find a long wave. Some immutable trend that is gonna permeate most of the 10 years of your career, the next 15-30 years! If you sat down and thought &#8220;what are the big long waves during my lifetime?&#8221;, jumping on them as a professional will probably be one of the smartest things you ever did. Because if you did nothing, but jump in the computer-business in the late 70s, early 80s, maybe even up to the Microsoft IPO, you had a phenomenal run, 20-something years where you had a very high chance of achieving a higher position, more material income, and just being in a better place, then if you&#8217;d chose, for example,  Detroit.</p>
<p>So you got to think what wave you&#8217;re on and how you get on the wave that makes sense for you both from an interest perspective, a geography perspective, what you want to do with your life. […] Its easiest to see [these waves] right here on campus (note: talking about Stanford School of Engineering). […] Research universities are the start of the waves. </p>
<p>The no. 1 thing you can do is figure out what wave are you riding, and make sure you&#8217;re not on a wave that&#8217;s going down.</p></blockquote>
<p>He identifies three streams, according to what&#8217;s going on at Stanford: IT, which is a mature wave, biotech, and clean tech. It puts a lot of things in perspective for me, regarding all the companies, projects, and my own business ideas that I come across on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Focus on things that are going up, not going down! And focus on your fit with them!</p>
<p>Thanks to vodpod, you should be able to watch that whole scene here (if not: <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2068">here</a>).<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/read-dammit.jpg?w=250" alt="Read dammit!.jpg" border="0" width="250" align="right" />Visitors to Tech IT Easy may have noticed a slight increase in posting-rhythm last week—I averaged at about 2 articles a day. They say that the simplest reason is often the most straightforward one—I was on a brief relaxing holiday—but that wasn&#8217;t actually the core-reason why I wrote more.</p>
<p>Last week, I managed to read two books, one of which I <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/11/11/why-zen-in-the-art-of-archery-is-a-great-productivity-read/">blogged about</a> and another of which, a draft is awaiting some QC before being posted. I remember this effect when I was a youngster, reading always made me feel like writing something. Countless were the fantasy-stories I started, but never finished, back when I was reading Tolkien et al. </p>
<p>Luckily blogposts are shorter… during my one year stint on <a href="http://foodandretail.blogspot.com">foodandretail.blogspot.com</a>, where I blogged daily, I was on a constant regime of reading related articles and books at night and blogging about them soon after. </p>
<p>There you have it: <strong>reading more makes you a more prolific writer</strong>. I also say this now that a <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/08/11/15/192222.shtml">study revealed</a> that reading less and watching more TV makes you unhappy—or is it that unhappy people watch more TV, I can never figure out the chicken or the egg… </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for, go pick up a book <em>and</em> <strong>make</strong> some time to read it!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Just briefly! Just spoke to a long-lost friend of mine who called me out of the blue and tried to explain it to him. I feel very strongly about Facebook, not because I think it&#8217;s a great service—it&#8217;s no surrogate for real friendship, that&#8217;s for sure—but because it works well for people like me who have moved around a lot internationally over the years. </p>
<p>Everyone I collect in Facebook—and I sometimes do feel like a coin-collector—is someone that I have shared an experience with. Whether it&#8217;s my family, kindergarden-friends in Germany (none yet, I&#8217;m afraid), highschool-friends in the Netherlands, uni-friends in the UK, bloggers on Tech IT Easy, etc. etc. I want to keep a life-line connected to all of them.</p>
<p>Why? Well, I have a master-plan, which is that when I die, <strong>you will get sent an invite to my funeral !!!</strong> As a matter of fact that would make a great facebook-app, I think!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/the-pavlov-business-model.jpg?w=300" alt="The pavlov business model.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />If that phrasing sounds a little weird, let me explain. Over these last three days, I&#8217;ve been watching Dharmesh Shah&#8217;s <a href="http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/7196/Video-from-Business-of-Software-Everything-I-Know-About-Startups.aspx">really great presentation</a> on what he knows about startups, in which he talks, amongst other topics, about the attention economy vs. the wallet economy. If you haven&#8217;t already, you should really check it out!</p>
<p>The <em>attention economy</em> is based on eyeballs, on non-paying visitors to your site or users of your app that, through some magical reasoning, will translate into clicks on advertising, eventually leading to income to you the entrepreneur. I call that magical because no one I know of actually clicks on adverts.</p>
<p>The <em>wallet economy</em> is based on eyeballs with little hands reaching out of it that hold cash with which they pay you. I serve product A, it costs $20, you pay, I just gained $20 (minus cost of goods sold). The feedback is instantaneous and you don&#8217;t have to wait for X000 customers to land on your site and 0.000X% of them clicking on adverts. </p>
<p>This is pretty much the way the world has always worked, with the exception of newspapers and, arguably, the internet is one big newspaper (seriously lacking in editors).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy to go the attention route, because it&#8217;s very easy to build soft-/webware in the first place. When you start a business in the real world, you make real investments, usually with the help of external funding like banks, that want to see a real return on their money. When you start a &#8220;digital&#8221; startup, you need a PC, you need to know some code, you need to spend $20 on a domain and $10-50 per month on hosting. The pressure isn&#8217;t there to really push for every dollar of income, because you aren&#8217;t feeling the banks et al. pushing down on your back. As a matter of fact, you can just set up a service, and go pursue another career, waiting for it to magically attract enough eyeballs to make you millions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice, in theory, but it&#8217;s not what entrepreneurship is about. Entrepreneurship is like the film &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/There-Will-Blood-Daniel-Day-Lewis/dp/B0013FXWU6/?tag=reviewrus-20">There will be blood</a>.&#8221; Life is tough, you have to fight for every drop of oil, people hate you and you will probably end up killing (=divorcing) a member of your family in the process.</p>
<p>And that kind of work deserves the instant gratification that cash for your product provides. </p>
<p>The end. Have a nice weekend, y&#8217;all!<br />
<em>Vincent</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>It&#8217;s a fair question and one which is keeping us stunned for a moment. As I already mentioned, I have recently been engaged in a business development project, in which I, along with two others, have been developing a business case for a project in the wine-industry. The advantage is that a business plan is more or less* ready (*: I&#8217;ll write a future post on how I think such projects can be improved), and that there will be a certain base-salary. The disadvantage is that, unlike most salaried positions, I know, it will be extremely hard work and you will, apart from some physical labour, be responsible for building a market (which can be fun, but requires a certain determination). And… a big and, you have to be living in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Following is the text of the advert, which we have placed on a wine-university-site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vinoloog.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=150&amp;Itemid=94"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/wijn-ondernemer-advertentie.jpg?w=485&#038;h=522" alt="wijn ondernemer advertentie.jpg" border="0" width="485" height="522" /></a></p>
<p>So far we haven&#8217;t received an enthusiastic response, which leads me to believe that we have to use different platforms for our search. I put it here, even though I know that most of you aren&#8217;t in the target-audience—i.e. living in the Netherlands—and the work is also fairly low-tech: it&#8217;s a p2p—<em>people to people</em>—business. </p>
<p>But one of you maybe has some experience in this. <strong>Where would you suggest that we look for entrepreneurial folk?</strong> I&#8217;ll take the person that offers the best response out for a drink, next time they&#8217;re in Amsterdam or I&#8221;m in Paris!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/cure-for-everything.jpg?w=300" alt="cure for everything.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />I think that for every health-nut like me, there&#8217;s about 8-9 people that don&#8217;t care. Of course, they start caring as soon as the doctor tells them they have to, but that&#8217;s another story…</p>
<p>One benefit (and frustration) of health-nuttiness is that you start paying attention to a lot of publications about what&#8217;s good for you. Often, way-way-way before these things are actually implemented on a massive scale across society (very similar to early adopter syndrome in technology, actually), influenced by mass-media-attention, industry-adoption, and insurers-approval (the big brother of the health industry).  </p>
<p>To that effect, a number of health-&#8221;innovations&#8221; have become mainstreamed, namely:
<ul>
<li>Vitamine-supplements in your food</li>
<li>The use of vegetable oil in (fast-food) restaurants</li>
<li>(Larger) salads in fast-food restaurants (qu&#8217;elle innovation!)</li>
<li>Omega-3 supplements in your food</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is actually kind of interesting, because for years now scientists have noticed a <a href="http://www.softecare.com/Ingredients/omega_3_benefits_and_facts.cfm">shortage</a> of Omega-3 (aka. Fish Oil) in Western diets and the correlation with heart disease, cancer, arthritis, allergies and other chronic diseases, as well as, less published, depression. Yes, there are <a href="http://www.mcmanweb.com/omega3.html">therapies</a> against depression that involve significant daily intakes of Omega-3. No doubt, that isn&#8217;t the main reason that we now see Omega-3 in nearly every fatty dairy product in supermarket, but nevertheless it is a victory for both science, mankind, and their brains.</p>
<p>Does  the need for food-innovation end here? Far from it, read a few health-mags and go travel the sandwich-shops, Starbucks, and all the other places that busy people (over 50% of our adult population) frequent on a daily basis (not to mention school cafeterias!). You&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s a predominance of <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19534.htm">simple carbohydrates </a>(white bread, rice, and pasta, rather than their healthier wholemeal counterparts), greasy meat snacks (with very little in protein-based vegetarian alternatives), and, of course just plain sugar (from soft-drinks to chocolate-bars). </p>
<p>If you read about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0060938455/?tag=reviewrus-20">rise of McDonalds</a>, you&#8217;ll know that in a large part its low priced success is attributed to using inferior ingredients. Even now, I think that any sane entrepreneur in the catering industry will automatically reach for those same ingredients, because there is simply too little awareness of (or caring about) better alternatives. There continues to, of course, be a micro-movement of people—those same people that buy so-called biofood at a significant premium, not to mention (alternative) scientists—that push for better, more responsible food-production. And there is no doubt, enough media-attention about a number of health-problems and how they could be solved. So much so, that, apart from the cost-factor, I do wonder why many of these simple innovations (like whole-grain hamburgers, for instance) aren&#8217;t yet here.</p>
<p>Perhaps we just need to shout louder!? Perhaps… I think I will finish that thought of how to encourage &#8220;revolutions&#8221; in not only health, but also other areas like green innovation, in a future blogpost!</p>

Where, as an individual, can you expect to get plenty of access to that type of information? If your answer isn&#8217;t universities, please let me know!</p>
<p>As promised, I&#8217;ll be focussing more on innovation on Tech IT Easy these coming months, and you can be sure that my search for content will focus on universities and other institutes, rather than the internet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting challenge for sure, particularly as I&#8217;ll be reading a whole bunch of dry scholarly articles and dissertations, as well as tracking down interesting organisations for interviews, to hopefully produce something of value for you and me.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve asked before, if you have interesting ideas for content of this nature, or even want an interview, article, or thesis (summary) of your own to be published here, please drop a comment or <a href="mailto:techiteasyblog@gmail.com">mail</a>!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Archery-Eugen-Herrigel/dp/0375705090/?tag=reviewrus-20"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/zen-in-the-art-of-archery.jpg?w=192&#038;h=289" alt="zen in the art of archery.jpg" border="0" width="192" height="289" align="right" /></a>A little less tech this time, though it could be argued that philosophy is the highest tech of all! Thinking about the book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Archery-Eugen-Herrigel/dp/0375705090/?tag=reviewrus-20">Zen in the Art of Archery</a>,&#8221; first published in 1953 by Eugen Herrigel, a philosophy-scholar, already brings me in a spiritual mood, where I say that &#8220;teaching&#8221; is in fact only &#8220;releasing what is inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the book <em>released</em> in me then, was an appreciation of the non-conscious doing of things. If there is one &#8220;productivity&#8221; book that you should read, I would say it is this one because it just inspires you to keep doing what you are doing, because there is a higher purpose. The end-result is something akin to enlightenment.</p>
<p>The book uses the examples of archery, and later swordsmanship, to illustrate the process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen">Zen</a>, which is a school of Buddhism. In regards to swordsmanship, Herrigel writes:<br />
<blockquote>Among swordmasters [...] it is taken as proved that the beginner, [...] however courageous and fearless he may be at the outset, loses not only his lack of self-consciousness, but his self-confidence, as soon as he starts taking lessons. He gets to know all the technical possibilities by which his life may be endangered in combat […]. He is now forced to admit that he is at the mercy of everyone who is stronger, more nimble and more practised than he.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a parable for life if there ever was one.</p>
<p>In order to find the solution, you first have to identify the problem in the paragraph above. Is it that the pupil is less skilled than his peers? Or is it that he &#8220;loses not only his lack of self-consciousness, but his self-confidence?&#8221; The purpose of Zen, at least the way it is explained in this book, is to regain the latter through mastery of a given activity. But mastery can never be attained through endless practice alone. It is by reaching a stage where act without thinking, where &#8220;it&#8221; happens, rather than you making it happen. </p>
<p>I notice that same principle in a number of activities, such as running long distances, writing, painting, even in holding meetings.
<ul>
<li>If you think while you run, you lose your rhythm. </li>
<li>If you think while you write, something I&#8217;ve also called &#8220;<a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/09/28/group-blogging-and-the-barriers-to-blog/">research while you write</a>,&#8221; you lose the flow. </li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a prepared agenda before a meeting, you risk getting pulled into all kinds of directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to lower yourself into a state of instinct, shutting out your thoughts and &#8220;just do it.&#8221; Nike was inspired by Zen, and you never knew it…</p>
<p>Books like &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/0874775043/?tag=reviewrus-20">The Now Habit</a>,&#8221; make a similar point, that you have to reach that state of &#8220;now,&#8221; in order to do things well. Even &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/?tag=reviewrus-20">Getting Things Done</a>,&#8221; is about removing the clutter in life, so that you can focus on the doing. I&#8217;ve only started reading such books since about three years ago, but I already feel that it&#8217;s starting to change me, to an extent where I can sit in a crowded room and just focus on what I need to do. </p>
<p>The purpose of any contest, of any activity, is not to master the technique, it is to master the situation. Herrigel writes:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;How does skill become &#8220;spiritual,&#8221; and how does control of technique turn into master swordplay? Only so [...] by the pupil&#8217;s becoming purposeless and egoless. He must be taught to be detached not only from his opponent but from himself. He must pass through the stage he is still at and leave it behind him for good, even at the risk of irretrievable failure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These last words are what you in fact hear over and over again from those we consider successful in (business-)life. <em>To be successful, you must not only be good, but you must not be afraid to fail.</em></p>
<p>With those words, I think, I&#8217;ll leave you.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/back-to-the-future-blog.jpg?w=300" alt="Back to the future blog.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />My stance is, like a year ago (<a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/12/14/is-software-high-tech/">1</a>, <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/12/15/is-software-high-tech-take-ii/">2</a>, <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/01/15/is-software-high-tech-if-not-is-it-a-commodity/">3</a>), still that software is a tired &amp; over-covered space both in terms of blogging and in terms of starting a business. No doubt there is a purpose to all of it—I&#8217;m frequently surprised about how existing software is copied by others and still improved drastically, just by filling in some missing features. But there is also a lot of blogging going on in this space, which makes software-journalism commodity-journalism. </p>
<p>Brainstorming with myself a little before about the tech-space, I split it into three segments: software, hardware, and &#8220;superware.&#8221; The latter is what I propose for a new area of coverage on Tech IT Easy.</p>
<p><strong>Superware</strong> or super-tech is world-changing technology, like space-technology, medicine, biotech, alternative fuels, etc. Having listened to loads of VCs speak these last months, looking at industry-trends, and the current state of our planet, I think that is where we are going. And frankly, writing about software/hardware bores me. I propose that I write something about these new technologies at least once a month—I&#8217;ll try more frequent posts, but that area is pretty research-intensive. I&#8217;ll still continue to write about entrepreneurship &amp; related stuff, of course.</p>
<p>If you want to chime in on this topic with some ideas (e.g. exciting new developments in super-tech), feel free to drop a comment or send me <a href="mailto:techiteasyblog@gmail.com">a mail</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/solving-the-human-resource-puzzle.jpg?w=300" alt="solving the human resource puzzle.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />Help me analyse a market, in this case the job-market from the perspective of employers. My questions are several in fact, but I think some of the answers are contained in following paragraphs and hopefully your comments. The questions:
<ol>
<li>Do employers benefit from high visibility of their job-openings?</li>
<li>Are job-adverts a push or a pull-phenomenon? I.e. do employers prefer to control who sees what or do they not care and instead implement barriers from within?</li>
<li>Is there an advantage to the highly inefficient job-forms that the larger companies and temp-agencies seem to use (with zero-compatiblity between them)?</li>
<li>Is there such a thing as best practice in recruiting?</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s several scenario that I&#8217;m thinking about here. The simplest one is that if you release an advert into the open, <strong>you also want plenty of people to see it.</strong> In this scenario, employers enjoy maximum visibility.</p>
<p>Another perspective is to look at it from the <strong>administrative overhead</strong> that comes with each applicant. Let&#8217;s say, you want a CV and a letter. Then for each CV, you need a good 2-15 mins and for each letter the same. That&#8217;s 30 mins per applicant. You need to make a short-list of applicants that meet your requirements and then invite and schedule each one for an interview. Pretty soon, for every shortlisted applicant, we&#8217;re talking about half a day&#8217;s work. Of course, looking at the way large companies do it, there are a number of short-cuts to take, such as:
<ul>
<li>ask applicants to enter their CV into a form, which makes reading multiple applicants at once a little easier.</li>
<li>ask applicants to come on an open day and create scenarios where you can evaluate them in different settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a third perspective, which I call <strong>&#8220;the right person for the right job&#8221; scenario</strong>. Here, I assume that the company already has a pretty complete profile (beyond the X years of experience and degree Y buzzwords) of a person that they want to work with. For instance, you may want someone local, someone who has worked at one of your competing firms in the area, and who has an education at the local school. For this exercise, I&#8217;m thinking farming, but I&#8217;m sure this works with plenty of other industries. The advantage of such an individual is that they have experience in both the job and the context in which the job operates, as well as probably being cheaper. Here it makes sense to seek applicants in a targeted fashion, e.g.. through your network or through your local newspaper. Of course, if we reverse some of this, e.g. you want someone global, you on the other hand, want a higher visibility of your job-opening. The same if you want someone highly specialised, but of which there are only a few available to you globally.</p>
<p>Another factor: <strong>the economy</strong>. If there is high unemployment, employers naturally want prevent a large inflow of applicants. Here, I&#8217;d say that the no. 1 way of recruiting is through your own network, as someone will probably know someone that is looking and hopefully qualified.</p>
<p>Ignoring the last factor, <strong>my answer</strong> to this question is that companies which are small and operate on a small scale do not benefit from high visibility of jobs. And companies that are small and operate on a large scale, the same, as both do not have the internal resources. Only companies that have found an efficient way to manage a large number of applicants and/or who can afford the time-consuming process (usually larger companies), can afford high visibility. And for them, there&#8217;s still the difference between local and global employees. My assumption is that global companies (want to) have less ties to local environments as they relocate operations dynamically according to environmental conditions (costs, resources, etc.). Thus they will always prefer a high visibility of job-openings.</p>
<p>Your input?<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/new-venture-business-plan-competition.jpg?w=200" alt="New Venture business plan competition.jpg" border="0" width="200" align="right" />After completing a previous business development project just a few days ago, I immediately &#8220;ventured&#8221; onto my next challenge, writing a business proposal for the first stage of the <a href="http://www.newventure.nl/en/about">New Venture competition</a>. To those that don&#8217;t know it, it is one of the largest of such competitions in Europe, builds on top of <a href="http://www.newventure.nl/en/about/starting-up_book">a methodology</a> developed by McKinsey, and exposes your plan to a number of experts (financial or otherwise) that provide you with feedback and coach you through the next two stages: the feasibility study and the final business-plan. </p>
<p>The requirements for this <a href="http://www.newventure.nl/en/about/deadlines/round1">first stage</a> were to present a 2-page max document, which includes:
<ul>
<li>The name</li>
<li>Describing the idea</li>
<li>Describing its innovativeness</li>
<li>Describing the market</li>
<li>Describing how you will make money</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually started collecting data on the market and how to build the product about a month ago, as the market was similar to my previous project (though there is no conflict!). These last two days, I spent writing this thing full-time, minus some blogging here and twittering there, of course (in retrospect, I should&#8217;ve written something about it before the current deadline passed—it ends sometime today. Sorry about that!).</p>
<p>I went a little overboard, I think, splitting the idea into three components: the product, the underlying technology, and the organisation; translating &#8220;innovativeness&#8221; into competitive advantage; splitting market into target audience and competitive landscape; and proposing a number of parallel trajectories towards making money. I really maxed out those two pages and hope it wasn&#8217;t all too wordy.</p>
<p>What did I learn? Nothing on its effectiveness yet! But that it is a. very difficult to put an idea into simple words that everyone would understand it—my father doesn&#8217;t get it at all, for instance. And b. it really forces you to rationalise your thinking into concrete steps. &#8220;Does the idea make sense?&#8221; was a question that I constantly kept asking myself. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect to win this competition, but as with all things, if you don&#8217;t try, you certainly don&#8217;t fail, and you most certainly don&#8217;t succeed. Wish me luck! More when I get the feedback!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Some time ago, I promised to stop writing about social networking, except if there is some tangible data involved. Well, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://twitter.com/vincentvw">Twitter</a> for over a year now, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/vincentvw">FriendFeed</a> for a few months, and a new service, called <a href="http://www.qwitter.com">Qwitter</a>, for a few weeks. Qwitter&#8217;s raison d&#8217;être is the topic of the day today.</p>
<p>What Qwitter does is tell you when people stop following you on Twitter. I fear that many people won&#8217;t be interested in using it, as there is a natural bias towards the positive. And Qwitter&#8217;s core-business is providing you with negative news.</p>
<p>Still, I saw my follower-numbers (currently at ca. 120) going up and down regularly, and I was curious about why this is happening. And the answer is pretty simple:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/vincentvw/statuses/978770796"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/twitter-vincent-van-wylick-after-being-on-qwitter-for.jpg?w=607&#038;h=210" alt="Twitter _ Vincent van Wylick_ After being on Qwitter for ....jpg" border="0" width="607" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>What Qwitter does is send you a mail-message with the name of the person &#8220;qwitting&#8221; you, as well as the message that may (or may not) have been the instigator. So far, I received 8 of these, with one person unsubscribing from me three times (!), and one celebrity unsubscribing from me, Guy Kawasaki. </p>
<p><strong>The one that &#8220;got away&#8221;</strong><br />
Why do I say that people unfollow me, because I don&#8217;t follow them? I think the data says a lot.
<ul>
<li>Subject 1, let&#8217;s call him J., follows <strong>2,447</strong> and is followed by <strong>2,393</strong>. He unsubscribed from me, when I said: &#8220;<em>@ksilvennoinen welcome back to the internet!</em>&#8220;</li>
<li>Subject 2, let&#8217;s call him G. (has been trying to subscribe to my LinkedIN and Facebook as well, btw. He follows <strong>1,868</strong> and is followed by <strong>1,132</strong>. The Twitter-message: &#8220;<em>P.S. to my blogpost: 2nd Antarctic explorer turned public speaker that I&#8217;ve heard. Superb motivational speakers. Living life 2 Xtreme rocks!&#8221;</em></li>
<li>Subject 3, let&#8217;s call him R., follows <strong>2,225</strong> and is followed by <strong>2,106</strong>. The Twitter-message: same as above.</li>
<li>Subject 4, let&#8217;s call him J3. (the guy who unsubscribed 3 times), follows <strong>219</strong> and is followed by <strong>331</strong>. The Twitter message: &#8220;<em>sipping Bacardi and writing a presentation for tomorrow.</em>&#8220;</li>
<li>Subject 5, let&#8217;s call him M., follows <strong>1,611</strong> and is followed by <strong>1,482</strong>. The Twitter message: &#8220;<em>Today, German shepherds with machine guns on their backs killed me 34 times. Guess what game I played?</em>&#8220;</li>
<li>And, the cream of the crop, the Alltop-guy, Guy Kawasaki……… follows <strong>24,104</strong> and is followed by <strong>24,058</strong>. The Twitter-message: &#8220;<em>I long for the day where the letters PeeCee stand for P**sEasy (no joke).</em>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you may notice three things. One, that my Twitter-messages are pretty entertaining… <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Two, that most of these guys follow a lot of people. And three, that there is nearly perfect parity between their followers and who they follow.</p>
<p><strong>What is your problem?</strong><br />
&#8220;What is your problem?&#8221; you might ask. &#8220;Following back is only polite.&#8221; I agree to an extent, and I appreciate if people follow me back. But I don&#8217;t expect it! For one, why do I use Twitter? To keep track of things, like my friends and news-items. Some pretty interesting links come across my screen every once in a while. If I need to talk to people, I&#8217;ll say stuff, but those people I want to talk to, I have their email-address. Talking on Twitter is <em>not</em> my motivation.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that if someone follows 24,000 people and you are 24,001, you get a very tiny portion of the attention that you deserve as an individual. It&#8217;s nearly the same as saying as &#8220;I don&#8217;t really follow you at all.&#8221; Imagine what that person&#8217;s screen must look like? 3-4-10 messages per second? So, I don&#8217;t, on principle, follow anyone that is following more than let&#8217;s say 200 people… Unless they actually say something meaningful as well. </p>
<p>Many people who follow 1000s though are a. in social media/marketing, which automatically makes them less interesting to me (because there are just so many of them), and b. respond to so many people that I find it very hard to judge the quality of their &#8220;original thinking&#8221; by looking at their Twitter-feed.  </p>
<p><strong>Why do I write this post?</strong><br />
Because I want to make people aware that if you do follow me, please don&#8217;t expect me to follow back automatically. And if you want to get my attention, a good start is to *talk to me,* you know, use the @-symbol!? And third, if possible, make the content original. There&#8217;s so many social media marketeers out there, it&#8217;s not even funny. Be original, be fun, talk to me, I&#8217;ll be there.</p>
<p>The irony of it is, do I really expect someone that treats their Twitter-follows &amp; followers with so little respect to read my blogpost?</p>

<p>In case you didn&#8217;t know, most Macs come with cameras built-in, <em>excluding</em> the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro, and every Mac before Intel came on board. Last week, I went searching for a camera + microphone, because during my other <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/14/pychology-of-a-mac-man/">little adventure</a> of unscrewing and re-screwing my Mac 39 times, I managed to somehow break the inbuilt mic (and there&#8217;s no way, I&#8217;ll open up my Mac for a mic.!). So, I went searching for a solution that was cable-efficient. Like most Mac-laptops, mine only has two USB-ports and no line-in for a mic., so my choices were:
<ul>
<li>getting a USB-mic &amp; a separate USB-webcam (using both USBs)</li>
<li>getting a USB-webcam with a mic. built in (in theory: 1 slot)</li>
<li>getting a USB-webcam &amp; a separate Bluetooth-headset (1 slot)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever would happen, I would end up using at least 1 USB-slot, so my decision would be somewhere in-between quality and cost.</p>
<p><strong>The search</strong><br />
Enter a consumer-electronics store (<a href="http://www.mediamarkt.nl">Mediamarkt</a> is no. 1 here in the Netherlands or Germany), and you will likely be confronted with a whole bunch of Logitech, some Microsoft, maybe some Philips, and some other, possibly cheaper or more upscale brands. Of these, none <em>but one</em> (I&#8217;ll get to it later) actually mention anything like Mac-support.</p>
<p>Luckily, my Mediamarkt also had an internet-connection (through the Apple-section) for me to check the many confusing brand-designations (I want to shoot whoever thought a combo of letters and numbers was a good way to sell products to consumers!).</p>
<p>Turns out, getting a webcam or a USB-mic that works on a Mac, isn&#8217;t a problem. Plug it in and it usually works. The webcam just needs to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class">UVC</a>—a Universal USB 2.0 Video Class Cam. Getting a webcam &amp; a built-in mic, however, and we enter complex territory. First of all, hardly any sites really discuss the mic factor (you can find Mac-compatible stuff <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mac%20compatible%20webcams">here</a>). I guess, because most laptops have a built-in mic or line-in, hardly anyone considers it. I&#8217;ve had a couple of adventures, such as a Microsoft one, where the mic. wasn&#8217;t recognised and a for-Macs advertised webcam, which, 1st of all, had horrible video-quality and second, came with a headset that needed a line-in (eh, not really useful for many Macs). </p>
<p>So, one camera in the whole store, offering ca. 30 webcams, is advertised as 100% Mac-compatible: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-QuickCam-Vision-Pro-Mac/dp/B001AOK7KI/?tag=reviewrus-20"><strong>Logitech Quickcam Vision Pro for Mac</strong></a>. It is the only camera that is 100% designed for Macs. It is also the most expensive in the store, at ca. €100 euros, though offering a 2-megapixel sensor and a fairly good in-built mic. Everything else, in that store at least, doesn&#8217;t &#8220;officially&#8221; work for Macs (you can find a few more on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=mac%20webcam%20&amp;tag=/?tag=reviewrus-20">Amazon</a>). Btw. if you do need anything like a driver, check out <a href="http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/">macam</a> or <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/iusbcam/">iUSBcam</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Why Mac audiences are so valuable</strong><br />
So why are Mac-audiences so valuable? Well, you can literarily charge more. Whether it&#8217;s a webcam, a usb-mic, software, etc. You can hike up the price by at least 10% and watch the less price-sensitive consumer roll in. You frequently hear the &#8220;Windows = bigger market&#8221; argument, and I wholeheartedly agree. But my argument that Windows is a big market <em>for commodities</em> rings more true. For every super-upscale model you offer in hardware, there will be dozens of cheaper knock-offs eating up your market. And for every upscale software, you can be sure that a million pirated versions are floating around on the networks.</p>
<p>The closed system, which I am as critical of as the next guy, is what makes Macs attractive for technology-companies, because at whatever small scale you do end up producing, demand will most certainly exceed supply.</p>
<p>And the consumer? Well, he did decide to buy a more expensive machine in the first place, and whatever you can say about Mac-pricing, he will, most of the time, get a better machine and accessories than on the Windows-side of things.</p>
<p><strong>What was my solution?</strong><br />
Being a cheapskate (a previous Windows-user and I&#8217;m Dutch), I found a free bluetooth headset lying around, I got with my mobile phone once. Turns out, all of those are compatible with Macs that come with Bluetooth (pretty much all of them). And now, having 2 free USB-slots, I can take my time and pick a UVC-compatible webcam that offers reasonable video-quality for Skype.</p>
<p>Were you ever in a similar situation? Probably not, but if you were, let me know how you solved the problem!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/startersdag-startups-rotterdam.jpg?w=300" alt="startersdag startups Rotterdam.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />Like <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/27/lessons-from-the-star-entrepreneurial-seminar/">last time</a>, I use Tech IT Easy as a note-taking tool for things I want to remember and which you might find interesting. I can&#8217;t say that I learned much that was profound yesterday, a the &#8220;Startersdag Rotterdam,&#8221; held by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (<a href="http://www.kvk.nl:80/regio/rotterdam/bedrijfstarten/005_Startersdag/startersdagrotterdam/Presentaties.asp">kvk.nl</a>), but more of the nitty-gritty stuff: how to organise your administration, etc.</p>
<p>Off the bat, nicest stands were the ones by <a href="http://www.startenmetmvo.nl">MVO Nederland</a> (socially responsible entrepreneurship) and, for novelty&#8217;s sake, the IKEA business stand. I first thought/hoped that IKEA (which I&#8217;m <a href="http://foodandretail.blogspot.com/search/label/Ikea">a big fan of</a>), was going to start branching out like Amazon (again <a href="http://foodandretail.blogspot.com/2007/11/amazon-jeff-bezos-on-strategy.html">a fan</a>) did, but it was just to attract new entrepreneurs to fill up their offices with IKEA-stuff. They did give me some nice chocolates though, and MVO gave me a box full of environmentally-friendly goodies (incl. coffee: the way to my heart).</p>
<p>Talks I listened too, were:
<ul>
<li>Starting an import/export business (KVK)</li>
<li>A business-plan according to the bank (Rabobank)</li>
<li>Setting up your administration (NOvAA)</li>
<li>Upgrading your accounting (Exact Online)</li>
<li>Going freelance (FNV)</li>
<li>Selling via the internet (Preij Software)</li>
</ul>
<p>Talks I should&#8217;ve listened to, but missed, were:
<ul>
<li>How to start (well duh!) (KVK)</li>
<li>A good start with the taxation-office (Belastingdienst (taxation office))</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone here happens to have been there, and published some notes about them, I would appreciate a link.</p>
<p>Some brief notes for each talk.</p>
<p><strong>Starting an import/export business</strong><br />
The essential thing I took away from it is that the risk is unevenly distributed. The importer pays for products beforehand and is also responsible to his customers if something were to go wrong. The only thing you can do is:
<ul>
<li>Visit: more can be seen and negotiated face-to-face</li>
<li>Make a deal to only pay a certain percentage upon proper delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things to bear in mind is that there are added costs, beyond the buying price: e.g. taxes and added charges for things like alcohol. And to check beforehand if there is anything like a copyright-limitation for your products. E.g. you apparently cannot just import Apple stuff from the US into the Netherlands, because importers already have an exclusivity arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>A business plan according to the bank</strong><br />
First off, I&#8217;ve been hearing great stuff about <a href="http://www.rabobank.nl">Rabobank</a>, while writing my thesis and talking to startups. It is the most progressive Dutch consumer-bank in that area. It should also be mentioned that the bank is still standing during the credit crisis, a good thing. I chose not to attend the same meetings, hosted by the ABN Amro and by ING bank.</p>
<p>Now, the meeting started with some BS (I thought), the bank would first look at &#8220;Who you are as an entrepreneur.&#8221; Not that this isn&#8217;t logical, but when I went outside and talked to a different banker about starting with multiple jobs, the guy&#8217;s eyes lit up green and he wanted to talk shop straightaway. No mention of whether I would actually have time to run a business and hold down multiple jobs. I also heard a new thing for me: creating a personal SWOT for your CV. </p>
<p>Financially, the bank looks at:
<ul>
<li>Own input: expects the entrepreneur to provide at least 20-25% of the total needed sum</li>
<li>A liquidity prognosis: how you will pay for stuff down the line</li>
<li>A profit &amp; loss statement</li>
<li>And, if your starting a limited company (a BV in the Netherlands), €18,000: that is a legal requirement to start under such a legal form</li>
</ul>
<p>.<br />
What is left over is: profit + deductions - withdrawals - investments. </p>
<p>I would love to hear how this differs in your country!</p>
<p><strong>Setting up your administration</strong><br />
Key-lessons I took away from it: set it up from day 1, set it up professionally (if needed, by a consultant), a good administration is the key to solid decision-making. And it&#8217;s also a legal requirement to keep some kind of administration as a business! Essentially, I got the idea that it&#8217;s just a matter of getting good accounting-software. On to my next point.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading your accounting</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.exactonline.nl/">Exact Online</a> (and Software, I believe), is a Dutch company that has been creating accounting software for about a decade. It&#8217;s in the top-3 in the Netherlands for online bookkeeping software, next to <a href="http://www.twinfield.com/">Twinfield</a> and <a href="http://www.reeleezee.nl/">Reeleezee</a> (pronounced Real Easy).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t actually have that much to say about it. Many of the questions from the audience were interesting though. People wondered about virusses, back-ups, total cost of ownership (it&#8217;s subscription-fee based), etc. The idea of online bookkeeping is that you can do it from everywhere, which is relevant mostly to the entrepreneur with the four-hour workweek. Also subscriptions are meant to reduced the financial burden up front. What I care most about is whether there is an integration with the taxation-form, which is, I hear, a very unpleasant activity here in the Netherlands, which was the case with Exact.</p>
<p><strong>Going freelance</strong><br />
The presentation was a total snore-fest. Key-lesson was that if you quit your job, but keep doing that same job for your previous employer as a freelancer, it doesn&#8217;t actually count as being an entrepreneur. You have to hand in some kind of description of your activities when you register at the chamber of commerce, and based on that you get assigned a status. It all seems very bureaucratic.</p>
<p>Some things about contracts:
<ul>
<li>verbal agreements are legal, except  that there isn&#8217;t any proof</li>
<li>parties involved must see and agree to the general conditions of the transaction.</li>
<li>signature is the deciding factor</li>
<li>watch out for changes that are made between the verbal agreement and the signing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selling via the internet</strong><br />
Even though I use the internet plenty, I know fairly little about the commercial aspects of it. The talk was mostly about designing websites, though, which wasn&#8217;t that interesting. Some key-points there: if you&#8217;re going to hire a third-party for a website, have him do it in a framework that can easily be adapted later on. The guy mentioned <a href="http://sites.google.com/">Google sites</a> for very basic stuff and <a href="http://www.joomla.nl">Joomla</a> for ecommerce/dynamic sites. The costs of creating a website, hosting it, and setting up shop are crazy-cheap!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all folks!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><em>Note: this post was written a few weeks ago, I just forgot to publish it.</em></p>
<p>Credit crisis, schmedit smeisis, I decided to just not care about it. Life is hard, it may have become harder, but that doesn&#8217;t meant that we shouldn&#8217;t just get on with it (a little harder) too. One of the issues today is whether it&#8217;s a good time to start a business and/or be in the early stages of a business. Because you&#8217;re in the money-begging phase and it seems like that&#8217;s in short supply right about now. I also decided to not care about that either. &#8220;Begging&#8221; for money is a psychological game: you present arguments and based on those you either get money or you don&#8217;t. If you don&#8217;t, you improve your arguments.</p>
<p>One tool to do that is to reduce assumptions to the absolute minimum. An article from my studies that always stayed with me, is entitled &#8220;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_assumption_planning">Critical assumption planning - a practical tool for managing business development risk</a></em>&#8221; and the diagram below is taken from it.</p>
<p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/6-steps-to-critical-assumption-planning.jpg?w=500" alt="6 steps to critical assumption planning.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></p>
<p>What is the point? An assumption is a guess that you make about a topic. I assume that (so many) people will buy my product, or I assume that building this machine for my company will take so many years, or I assume that my medical product will be approved by the relevant regulatory parties. Etc. etc. Each of these guesses, if wrong, can be fatal to your project, you know that and your investors know that. So how do you turn guesses into &#8220;truth,&#8221; or rather, into a perceived* truth (*: the fact is that nothing can be predicted 100%)?</p>
<p>Somewhat simple: <em>triangulation</em>. Triangulation means that you don&#8217;t trust single sources, least of all yourself, but rather place your faith in the power of many. To give you an example, for my current (non-tech) venture, I&#8217;ve divided our assumptions into 5 parts:
<ol>
<li>Who our consumer is</li>
<li>What the size of our market is</li>
<li>Who our competitors are</li>
<li>What our value proposition should be</li>
<li>And how this should work financially</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these are important things to work out and represent different challenges in doing so. </p>
<p>For our customers, I could send out a survey, but how can I be certain that the questions are the right ones and that it reaches the right audience? Instead, I chose for surveys and face-to-face interviews, and, guess what, some of my survey-questions were phrased* wrongly (*: the biggest danger in designing surveys). For our market, I have import-data for our industry from the government, which is itself based on estimates and doesn&#8217;t take into account different classes of products. So I have to sanity-check those figures with experts in that industry. And so on…</p>
<p>In the end, you should have the ingredients for a picture of your business-proposition, one you can work out into a number of pages or slides and present to potential investors and partners. And one that can act as the blueprint for what your business should look like. And if someone questions your assumptions, you can tick off, point by point, each of the reasons why you think you are right. That should be a nice feeling! <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Does this method of planning apply to all types of ventures? It could be argued that it&#8217;s most relevant to projects where the price of failure is expensive, e.g. real-estate. Starting something online may be much cheaper and quicker (perhaps), but I wouldn&#8217;t say that the price of failure is cheap. If you want to start something that you want to live off, that your co-founders and employees want to live off, then I&#8217;d say that the price of failure is pretty expensive for you and them too, and that having done your homework beforehand is a good thing!</p>
<p>Feedback on my own assumptions in this post are, as always, welcome!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586/?tag=reviewrus-20"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/positioning-battle-for-your-mind.jpg?w=250" alt="positioning battle for your mind.jpg" border="0" width="250" align="right" /></a>Jeremy reviewed it <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2006/07/11/positioning-the-battle-for-your-mind-a-must-read-by-al-ries-jack-trout/">first</a>, I reviewed/criticised it <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/16/why-positioning-is-the-wrong-word-a-book-review/">second</a>. And I guess this is the third take on it, after I managed to finish it. &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586/?tag=reviewrus-20">Positioning</a>&#8221; is a short book, well-written, and the only problem I had finishing it was that it was somewhat outdated. That said, the principles in it are fundamental to &#8220;positioning&#8221; a business, brand, or product in the mind of consumers.</p>
<p><strong>A one-paragraph retraction</strong><br />
What I said about conversation the last time, don&#8217;t ignore it, but take it with the grain of salt that this doesn&#8217;t apply to 98% of businesses yet. Sure, there is the <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/02/11/social-networks-a-complex-competitive-advantage/">social media hype</a> going on, but I&#8217;m not sure how relevant the conversation going on online is for many businesses and their (mainstream) consumers. An immediate problem that arises from too much consumer-exposure, is the danger of featuritis, reducing the real value you get from a product that is also a tool for something. On the company-level, the problem can come from dedicating too much energy to consumer-requests, and too little in surviving &amp; growing as a company. Conversation is nice, but it&#8217;s not everything for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>The review</strong><br />
I actually think that I learned a lot from this book and that it will always reserve an honoured space on <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/28/six-one-line-business-book-reviews/">my bookshelf</a>. </p>
<p>Some key-lessons include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumers think in ladders:</strong> they rank products from best to good enough and do so mainly on the basis of &#8220;who came first.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Launching new products</strong> means either fighting incumbents head-on (expensive), focussing on niches, or displacing the ladder altogether and starting a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Naming a business is tricky:</strong> things like initials are a definite <strong>don&#8217;t</strong>, and names should evoke an association with the purpose of your product.</li>
<li><strong>Once you name your business or product, it&#8217;s dangerous to extend that name to another product.</strong> An example mentioned was Xerox, which we all associate with copying, but which at some point made a faux pas into computing. Once people see Xerox copiers and Xerox computers, it disrupts the original association and weakens a company&#8217;s position on the ladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plenty of examples in the book, the ones most interesting to me were about positioning yourself when applying for jobs, and when running a business. But all examples, from ski resorts, whole countries, to drinks, show that there are shared underlying principles to positioning, which are essentially quite logical.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong><br />
This is a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586/?tag=reviewrus-20">must-read book</a></strong>, if you are thinking about marketing a product, a business, or yourself. The point I made before, is that we are all involved in marketing in some form or other. Whether it&#8217;s <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/07/22/making-applying-for-jobs-fun/">applying for jobs</a>, launching campaigns, and starting a business. I can&#8217;t recommend this book highly enough.</p>

Here are some of them.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punishment-Bantam-Classics-Fyodor-Dostoevsky/dp/0553211757/?tag=reviewrus-20">Crime and Punishment</a>: <strong>every choice has consequences and these consequences in turn affect future choices.</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Walk-Freedom-Autobiography-Mandela/dp/0316548189/?tag=reviewrus-20">Long walk to freedom</a>: <strong>the things worth fighting for often involve  falling &amp; getting up over and over again.</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Fable-About-Following-Dream/dp/0062502182/?tag=reviewrus-20">The Alchemist</a>: <strong>You won&#8217;t achieve much without faith!</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Should-Do-My-Life/dp/0375507493/?tag=reviewrus-20">What should I do with my life</a> (nice write-up <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/66/mylife.html">here</a>): <strong>when in doubt, reinvent yourself.</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/0874775043/?tag=reviewrus-20">The Now Habit</a>: <strong>a large part of productivity is scheduling time for fun as well.</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Your-Dissertation-Comprehensive-Comprehen/dp/0761919627/?tag=reviewrus-20">Surviving your dissertation</a> (or any write-a-research-paper book): <strong>the right answer often comes from triangulating many wrong ones.</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Drawing-Right-Side-Brain/dp/0874774241/?tag=reviewrus-20">Drawing on the right side of the brain</a>: <strong>Anyone can be an artist, it just requires the right perspective!</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X/?tag=reviewrus-20">The elements of style</a> (free <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/">here</a>): <strong>saying less often means saying more (and vice versa).</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Happiness-Handbook-Living/dp/1573221112/?tag=reviewrus-20">The art of happiness</a>: <strong>it&#8217;s about giving more than you take.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Comparing this list to the <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/28/six-one-line-business-book-reviews/">last one</a>, I think that business books (can) serve as a general framework for success in life and business (I didn&#8217;t list business-biographies and may do so later, as they make a slightly different point). These books, on the other hand, are about the softer interactions that go on: why are we here, what do we do it for, where are we going, how should we act towards each other and ourselves, etc. Life-stuff! </p>
<p><em>What good non-business book have you read that has had a profound influence on your life?</em><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/vincent.vanwylick/SQXXjaa2yWI/AAAAAAAAA94/OxFAuOrgicw/STAR%20Management%20Week%202008.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="STAR Management Week 2008.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />I spent today at an <a href="http://smw.rsmstar.nl/event.php?id=8">entrepreneurial seminar</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.rsmstar.nl/">Star</a> here at the Rotterdam School of Management. A number of speakers gave lectures, including Bernard van Oranje (co-founder of Levi9), Marc Cornelissen (adventurer), Annemarie van Gaal (founder of AM Media &amp; panel-member at the Dutch Dragon&#8217;s Den), Henk Keilman (founder of RIG Investments &amp; also at Dragon&#8217;s Den), and Dirk Scheringa (founder of DSB Bank). </p>
<p>As readers of this blog are mostly non-Dutch, most of these names will mean very little to you, and I won&#8217;t go into their individual companies here. Rather, I&#8217;ll focus on individual points that came forth.</p>
<p>The most interesting speaker to me was <a href="http://www.the-ba.net/the-BA/Events/DanaEvents/_Marc_Cornelissen_biog.htm">Marc Cornelissen</a>, who spoke mainly of his expeditions into the Antarctic and the North Pole and is also active in combating global warming. </p>
<p>3 main points:
<ul>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> When you&#8217;re operating on ice, there are different kinds of terrain and they also change dynamically. Sometimes everything is stable, sometimes you can walk on it, but can&#8217;t stand still, and sometimes you should avoid it. Traversing such terrain requires attention to detail, improvisation, teamwork, and speedy reactions.</li>
<li><strong>People:</strong> people&#8217;s motivation can change during the journey. Sometimes you find that you have to turn back at the beginning because for some reality was different than expected. It&#8217;s affected by the management-style certainly—sometimes putting too much pressure on someone can produce favourable results in the short-term, but cause burn-outs after a while—and it&#8217;s affected by what Marc called the iceberg: you see two parts of a person. The tip, which is the human resource with a certain skill-set, and the much larger part underneath, which is the personality, the motivation, the passion, the ownership of an idea. Getting to know that bottom-part requires interacting in an environment where it becomes visible.</li>
<li><strong>Choices:</strong> There are macro- and micro-choices. Macro-choices are the big ones you make, e.g. start a business, relocate your operations, etc. Micro-choices are the ones you make within each macro-choice and can affect your motivation. If you&#8217;re in hell and you have a choice to turn back, you will more often than not turn back. If you have no choice, you finish or die. Creating &#8220;no-option choices&#8221; may be scary, but they are sometimes what is needed to succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These points resonated with me throughout the whole day, and hopefully for longer. </p>
<p><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annemarie_van_Gaal&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DAnnemarie%2Bvan%2BGaal%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den-us">Annemarie van Gaal</a> also mentioned three success-factors that were critical for starting her media-business in Russia.
<ul>
<li>Have a <strong>flat organisation</strong> with no HQ to speed up decision-making and minimise overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Unlearn</strong> past behaviours, especially if the reality of where you are requires out of the box thinking.</li>
<li>And <strong>immerse</strong> yourself in an environment and give yourself little choice to pull out. Find motivation in what you do and don&#8217;t give up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again the points of preparing for uncertain terrain, managing people well, and no-option choices was present in all of these.</p>
<p><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Scheringa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DDirk%2BScheringa%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den-us">Dirk Scheringa</a> of DSB Bank was probably the best way to end the day. DSB Bank is a bank that has managed to avoid most of the pitfalls undermining current financial institutions. It focussed on simplicity, transparent &amp; solid decision making, and growing stably, rather than explosively. Well, I can&#8217;t pretend to know enough about banking to give a good explanation. </p>
<p>His key-lesson for me: surrounding yourself with smart people, means that you grow with them. It seems like a simple thing, but it often requires reducing your ego to work with people that are (as) smarter than you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all folks!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>We&#8217;ve already covered ULIKE in the past. You may recall: it used to be called <a title="TechITEasy Ulike.net" href="http://techiteasy.org/?s=ulik" target="_blank">ULIK</a>. Well, Ulik, cofounded by Mathieu Léronde &amp; Raphaël Labbé, has become <a title="ULIKE share cultural tastes" href="http://www.ulike.net" target="_blank">ULIKE.net</a>. I like a lot the vision behind ULIKE: ULIKE is not a web app, nor is it software or a &#8220;cultural Facebook&#8221;. <strong>ULIKE is before all a vibrant community whose members are taking pleasure on sharing their tastes</strong>. You can tell their community is extremely powerful by the density of their contributions: once you&#8217;ve subscribed and spent some time on the service, it becomes addictive naturally when you meet new people &amp; discover new things you may like. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of their new, beautiful, interface:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.ulike.net/"><img class="aligncenter" title="ulike" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3006/2903696467_418b954be7.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="500" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>I suggest you take a look at their excellent advertising: <span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/26/ulikenet-on-community-culture/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/cXKICOo5qdM/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>&#8230;or the movie their team (now funded by AXA Private Equity, one of the best VCs in Europe) made for their launch party. The movie highlights the 100 top contributors: <span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/26/ulikenet-on-community-culture/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/4dZcV_iyhv4/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span> (I love the music, by BNN)</p>
<p>Now that the introduction is made, what&#8217;s ULIKE for?<br />
- meeting new people, alike or very different, both virtually and in real life (ULIKERS tend to meet quite a lot offline)<br />
- discovering new stuff: books, paintings, cities, people, etc.<br />
-  sharing your tastes with your friends, family &amp; fools so that they can buy you gifts<br />
-  and having your own non-geek online gallery accessible to all online (so called ULIKE lounge).</p>
<p>At least, this is the way I use it. How about you? </p>
<p>Check out my ULIKE.net lounge! <a href="http://www.ulike.net/jeremy" target="_blank">http://www.ulike.net/jeremy</a></p>

It inspired me to write this one, from a consumer&#8217;s perspective. </p>
<p>Why I hate video:
<ol>
<li><strong>Media is the most &#8220;unflat&#8221; industry on this planet:</strong> from iTunes Video, to Joost, to Hulu (to Pandora: not video), all of which aren&#8217;t properly available in the Netherlands and other European countries.</li>
<li><strong>No separate audio-feeds:</strong> I don&#8217;t know about you, but I like audio-podcasts because I can listen to them and do something else. That doesn&#8217;t quite work with video. So I rarely watch them.</li>
<li><strong>No transcripts:</strong> transcripts are useful, not because I want to read, but because 95% of the internet is text-based, and 100% of aggregation is text-based. If I want to find great tech-content, I check TechMeme. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t really link up to interesting video-interviews like Robert Scoble&#8217;s (who is, btw, a much better video-producer than he is a blogger), but it links to &#8220;just another blogpost&#8221;(tm), because that is more easily searchable via Google. </li>
<li><strong>Flash:</strong> It is the standard for online video, I know, but anytime my browser slows down, you can be sure that Flash is somehow involved. Flash, you suck.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s my short list! I&#8217;d add <em>no connectivity to TV</em> to it, but I have an old Xbox with media-centre on it, so that problem is solved ( at least for me).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/twitter-business-model2.jpg?w=300" alt="Twitter business model.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />I only have a second to write this. Recently <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/help_twitter_find_a_revenue_model.php">ReadWriteWeb asked</a> about what Twitter&#8217;s business-model is. More recently, a rumour came about that Twitter will <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/10/twitter-to-get.html">start monetizing in 2009</a>, shortly after the company saw a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/16/ceo-change-at-twitter-ev-williams-back-at-the-helm/">CEO-change</a>. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/9bdb4485-f4b8-40ef-9af3-e3f23d753347/Help-Twitter-Find-a-Revenue-Model/">discussion</a> about the RRW-article on FriendFeed, I wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The real value of Twitter for companies and their customers is that they get instant feedback on their products and vice versa. I just have to say one bad thing about a brand, and I get a rep talking to me about it (from Skype to 37signals). It&#8217;s like Getsatisfaction, except distributed. Ironically, twitter-search made that happen.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Could this be a key-factor in how Twitter will try to make money? And, if so, are there comparable metrics that could give an indication as to the company&#8217;s value? I&#8217;m thinking that with Twitter&#8217;s reliance on <a href="http://search.twitter.com">search-results</a>, perhaps a comparison could be made with Google&#8217;s early business-model? </p>
<p>What do you think?<br />

<div align="center"><em>Probably not a mainstream user</em></div>
</div>
<p>Now, my list is not scientific at all, and is, as usual, meant to be the start of a conversation. What I would do to make it scientific however, is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Talk to experts (hello there, experts <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</li>
<li>Based on expert-input, design a survey that measures preferences per demographic (gender, age, spending-behaviour, etc.).</li>
<li>Advertise that survey on an industry-specific website (Alternatively: use survey to interview people face-to-face during an industry-specific event. Works well as a combo, the first being quantitative, the second qualitative.)</li>
<li>Process data into user-achetypes (and expected ratios).</li>
</ol>
<p>In web-apps, by which I mean a web-utitlity like <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> of <a href="http://www.Netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>, I&#8217;m curious as to both the archetypes and, later on, how to deal with them. Generally, you of course have the early adopter and the mainstream one, which, I know, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCrossing_the_Chasm&amp;ei=Ytv5SICJBYim1wbXzZEk&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGCHCytvTD32Jh9n7uVZbkm9YWUQ&amp;sig2=zWcSkveewNEASXYpo7oJyg">should be catered too differently</a>.</p>
<p>Following is a list of the ones that I would expect to play a role.
<ul>
<li><strong>The money-maker:</strong> This is typically the most pragmatic of the group, cares about results, speed, and task-specific information, but not so much about elegance and useless information.</li>
<li><strong>The (early) geek:</strong> This, at the risk of generalising, is very much the <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>-, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a>-, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a>-audience, by which I mean the typical commentator on those sites. They ask for feature, after feature, after feature, and often ask for too many of them. I call them &#8220;early&#8221; geeks, because I expect them to be rather young.</li>
<li><strong>The newbie:</strong> This is not the loudest of users, and tend to accept that which they get (as long as the quality is ok). I&#8217;m thinking people that use PCs with Vista-home pre-installed. I think that these are also pretty hard to reach with niche-apps.</li>
<li><strong>The specialist geek:</strong> I&#8217;m thinking photographers or writers, who have very specific demands of what an app should do and also a certain aesthetic demand. This would be more the Macbook Pro / Photoshop audience. Whether these are a large segment in the web-apps category, I&#8217;m not sure. I would expect that these apps don&#8217;t really meet with their approval, most of all because they are often free.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? Were there any archetypes that I missed or is the reality much simpler? (How) do you find out what the user-archetypes for your apps are? </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/aggressive-sales1.jpg?w=228&#038;h=348" alt="aggressive sales.jpg" border="0" width="228" height="348" align="right" />I feel, I&#8217;ve been somewhat conned. During my studies, I did a course called &#8220;New Business Development,&#8221; which was about me and a team working out a business-proposal in the form of a plan for <em>a new business within an existing business</em>. A <a href="http://workingsmarter.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/05/spinin.html">spin-in</a>, if you will, also sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship">intrapreneurship</a>.</p>
<p>But so far, 99% of business development jobs are nothing more than sales-functions disguised by a cooler name (E.g. <a href="http://jobsearch.monster.com/Search.aspx?re=130&amp;cy=us&amp;brd=1&amp;JSNONREG=1&amp;q=business+development&amp;rad=20&amp;rad_units=miles">Monster.com</a>)! I realise that nobody really likes salespeople, they have a bad name, but come on! Sales is when you have a product or service and you&#8217;re trying to sell it to a customer (B2B sales for companies; B2C sales for individuals). <em>Business development is when you develop <strong>a business</strong> for another company.</em> Believe it or not, there is a big difference!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not denying that changing the name from sales to business development is a great sales-tactic in itself. Just like the word &#8220;entreployees,&#8221; I recently came across. But, for people like me, looking for the right job, it makes things super-annoying. One company even said: as a business developer, we expect you to be calling people 99% of the time and spend the other 1% looking up their names in a phonebook. That is a sales-job, worse, a tele-sales job!</p>
<p>Incidentally, what I am currently doing for a consultancy is: leading a team of people to develop a new business opportunity for that company. And yes, my title is business developer or business development manager! That is not to say that sales isn&#8217;t an integral part of that function; I spend half my time networking with professionals and customers. The other half is spent in product- and operations-development for that business however. That is what makes it fun, that is what makes it &#8220;<em>a business</em>!&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/positioning.jpg?w=300" alt="Positioning.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" />Let me start by saying that we are passed the age of positioning, a concept that was pioneered as the 5th P, by the authors Ries &amp; Trout of the book, fittingly called &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586/?tag=reviewrus-20">Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</a>&#8221; Rather I think we are in the age of 2 C&#8217;s: Conversation &amp; Customisation. Before I explain, I&#8217;ll briefly summarise my thoughts about the book in the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>Book thoughts</strong><br />
What is positioning? It is<br />
<blockquote>the art and science of creating positions in a targets mind, something &#8220;that takes into consideration not only a company&#8217;s own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Positioning&#8221; is neither a bad, nor an irrelevant book. Jeremy Fain gave it <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2006/07/11/positioning-the-battle-for-your-mind-a-must-read-by-al-ries-jack-trout/">a favourable review</a> a while ago, which inspired me to give it a read. Some things I immediately liked were its thinness (213 pages) and a very effective table of contents—every item has a short paragraph underneath it, shortly summarising that chapter. The book is also a pleasure to read, written in a flowing fashion and using effective titles that make you curious about what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>The book itself points out that marketing has evolved in stages, determined by both our understanding of customers, but also by our competitors&#8217; understanding and subsequent copycat-strategies. A marketing-strategy is only effective if it comes through clearly and isn&#8217;t diffused by too much noise. </p>
<p>In the 50s, according to the book, marketing was focussed on <em>products</em>, i.e. marketing your better mousetrap. As production-techniques evolved and more mousetraps were produced, that became increasingly difficult. This was followed by the <em>image</em>-era, where the focus was on brand and reputation. Again, as competitors caught on, the noise-level eventually decreased the ROI of that strategy. Now, the book (originally published in 1985, republished in 2001) states, we are in the positioning era, which is about &#8220;getting in the consumer&#8217;s mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, but clearly companies have had two decades to perfect and clone best-in-class strategies, so what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p><strong>2 other C&#8217;s - Customisation &amp; Conversation</strong><br />
Focussing on product features, on brand-image, and now positioning, is clearly something that won&#8217;t lose in relevance anytime soon. Nothing good in marketing ever disappears, but rather the marketing-mesh becomes ever more <strong>c</strong>omplex, integrating what came before into more <strong>c</strong>omprehensive, more <strong>c</strong>omplete value-propositons. If I come up with more words starting with &#8216;C,&#8217; I can probably write a book about it ;). Remember, there&#8217;s also the 4 C&#8217;s of positioning: <strong>c</strong>onfidence, <strong>c</strong>larity, <strong>c</strong>ontinuity, and <strong>c</strong>ompetitiveness.</p>
<p>What struck me about the book was that it seemed to describe a one-way strategy for interacting with customers. It wasn&#8217;t one-way with the competition, rather the book advises to actively combat other companies through your messages—e.g. &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avis.com%2F&amp;ei=Mgr3SJzgH4Tc1gaO6fT3Dg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrhFLUORn2gyX6-Yf-MIxmow40ig&amp;sig2=70WlzObdztS_AtshhPSTbg"><em>Avis</a> is No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder!</em>&#8220;—and even change your brand-name if it makes sense—e.g. when <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bfgoodrichtires.com%2F&amp;ei=kwP3SLiOE4eWwgGXk-nLDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOWQtDIFzVW3raTNHJ1OnGYEQAqA&amp;sig2=XgWIUx64PAYaULQ9-4yNSg">B. F. Goodrich</a> (a company I never heard of) makes a tire, it is actually Goodyear that get most of the PR benefits, so why not change the name? The book&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;<em>The battle for the mind</em>,&#8221; yet that battle only takes place within a competitive environment.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying to ignore the competition, but the book does ignore the relationship that can be built up with customers these days. In a <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/10/jason-fried-of-37signals-on-bu.html">recent interview</a>, Jason Fried of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37Signals</a>, said that the company a. doesn&#8217;t market, and b. doesn&#8217;t really focus on the competition. I hate to bring up that little company every time, but it just has some great attributes. </p>
<p>There are two facets of today&#8217;s society that make a significant marketing-difference, as far as I can see. One is that it becomes increasingly easier to <strong>customise</strong> products. From just-in-time / lean manufacturing techniques in the factory, to agile development techniques, quick prototyping and market-testing in software, the argument for creating static <em>one-size-fits-all</em> products becomes less and less relevant.</p>
<p>The second is that there is a <strong>bottom-up media-explosion</strong>. Everyone is a journalist, everyone has a voice. Now that is certainly a science that still has to be perfected, but when I see initiatives like <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Getsatisfaction.com</a> for software, and <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/">Dell Ideastorm</a>, it certainly gives me hope.</p>
<p>Using these two effectively can be a differentiator in consumers&#8217; minds, one which is adapted to his or her tastes and one which evolves as that taste evolves. By perfecting the science of customisation, based on ongoing conversation, you actually lock in on a customer, you make him or her feel special and you completely make the competition irrelevant. At least… until the competition catches on, where we will need something else again.</p>
<p><strong>A reading list:</strong><br />
I&#8217;d like to end with reading list of books that I think discuss the next step in marketing, none of which, I should add, I have read. But I&#8217;m hoping you give your critical perspective in the comments and add some other reading suggestions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/"><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/13-inch-macbook.jpg?w=300" alt="13-inch Macbook.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" /></a>Please note: &#8220;A&#8221; Mac-man, One. Not All of them! <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/14/live-from-apples-spotlight-turns-to-notebooks-event/">Today</a> was probably the most innovative Mac-release since… well, the MacBook Air came out. Glass, button-less trackpads, led-backlit screens, combined NVIDIA GPUs and chipsets on one die, A super-rigid single piece (well I think it&#8217;s two main ones actually) casing. The new <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">Macbook</a> looks awesome!  I&#8217;m drooling on my keyboard right now.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that my Mac is slightly over three years old, and I&#8217;m sure the amount of my drool will be about the same as the guy/girl that bought a Mac a few months ago. That&#8217;s just Apple-reality and how innovative this update really is. </p>
<p>This piece is entitled the psychology of a Mac-man, because that is who I am. I&#8217;ve only owned one Mac in my whole life, but I was enticed by this machine, the iBook 12&#8243; G4, well before I bought it. Approaching it like a true geek, I researched all of my options. I wanted a small machine, didn&#8217;t even think of OSX or any &#8220;think different&#8221; factor, but just wanted the best in my budget, about €1000. </p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong><br />
I chose this machine for 5 reasons:
<ul>
<li>the keyboard was meant to be comfortable to type on</li>
<li>the screen was matte and good for super-long viewing</li>
<li>the machine was durable (Macs have an average life-time of ca. 4 years+)</li>
<li>a reasonable batterylife of 4 hours</li>
</li>
<li>reasonably portable at ca. 2 KGs</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the other machines I could get back then were priced like they are now, between €500-1500 and mostly seemed like they would fall apart in a few years. The only alternative worth considering was a Lenovo/IBM Thinkpad of ca. €2000: also super-wellbuilt and a good quality keyboard.</p>
<p>Software didn&#8217;t enter my mind at all. I was a  Windows-man before that and knew that OS inside-out. I just assumed that I would learn OSX just as quick and that MS Office would keep me compatible with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The wait was agonising, I remember. Every beep on the street, every car passing by, would make me run to the window. </p>
<p><strong>My companion</strong><br />
When I finally got my machine, it was magical. A white box, I was unpacking it with a friend. It just felt special, different from anything I bought before. OSX Tiger just looked cool.</p>
<p>In the months to follow, that laptop would become my constant companion. It was my baby and one that I would even wake up with sometime (sad, I know). But back then, writing was my life and I loved to go to a café and just type until the battery ran out.</p>
<p>Intel-Macs came out soon after. Suddenly the world changed: White Macbooks everywhere. Where before I was cool and unique, now everyone became the same. Of course, I was tempted to upgrade, like most of you are now, but I just kept repeating: I love my Mac, I love my Mac. And I did.</p>
<p>That love was expressed externally and internally. Countless were the discussions I had with people about Macs. I blogged about it here and on my old blog. In my short period of Mac-zen, I&#8217;ve convinced close to 10 people to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to the Mac way of life.</p>
<p>And I learned to become more productive on it too, using many of the little things I wrote about <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/10/14/favourite-official-unofficial-mac-plugins/">before</a>. I know so much about my Mac that it&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p>And when Leopard came out, unlike the new Vista, it <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/11/07/some-observations-after-a-week-on-mac-os-x-leopard/">ran just fine on my old Mac</a> and I knew I could keep it for a while longer!</p>
<p><strong>Drama</strong><br />
About 6 months ago, tragedy happened. Somehow my internal Airport-card had loosened (or so I guessed) and I was getting kernel-crashes every-time I tried to put it to sleep or reboot it. There&#8217;s something else that is special about Macs. When something is wrong, hard- or software, it tells you exactly what it is. That is the benefit of having that closed system that so many people (including me) sometimes criticise. Unlike a Vista-PC, I tried to fix <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/08/07/whats-the-frustration-cost-of-windows/">a few weeks back</a>, where I had no clue what was wrong.</p>
<p>Because I was skimmed these last few months, graduating, job-seeking, etc., I didn&#8217;t fix my Mac. Instead, it became a server-like entity, which I sometimes kept running for over a month. It was crazy, super-irrational, but it worked. I didn&#8217;t want to restart it too often, because it would act like an old car. I would press the power-button, and it would make a sound, then nothing. I would turn it off and try again. Again a sound and nothing! I would leave it running, warm it up, you know. <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Then off and on again. Aah, finally it would start! But it was a nerve-wrecking experience and I just tried to keep it running as long as possible instead.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution!</strong><br />
Then, last week, I took it to the next level. I knew what the problem was, and I didn&#8217;t care anymore. I was just going to try and fix it.</p>
<p>With the help of a French instructional video, my Swiss army-knife, and a credit-card, I started the operation. The thing to realise about my iBook and, I think, the Macbook Pros as well, is that doing anything internally is hell. There are countless screws, you have to know what you&#8217;re doing at all times.</p>
<p>But ok, I unscrewed 39 screws. I saw more of my baby then I ever wanted to see. I shoved credit-cards into it, I cleaned it, I screwed and put the screws into little diagrams I drew on paper. My heart would be racing and I&#8217;d clean the plastic parts from the inside to calm me down. Finally, I came to the Airport-card and I secured it with a piece of paper (as advised). I screwed 39 screws back in, attached cables, and prayed.</p>
<p>Finally, I pressed the button. Chime! Grey screen! Blue screen! Log-in <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> :D</p>
<p>I wrote on Twitter:<br />
<img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/mac-heaven.jpg?w=535&#038;h=103" alt="Mac heaven.jpg" border="0" width="535" height="103" /><br />
And I f**cking fixed it!</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong><br />
My love for this thing has been re-ignited. Its battery-life is still over 4 hours long (under special conditions), I love using it on the road and typing away at reports and what not. Apples rock!</p>
<p><em>Next morning addendum:</em> I realise that I didn&#8217;t say why I wrote this post and what I think of the new Macbooks within that context. I guess I&#8217;m saying that if you have a Mac now, you should look at it closely before upgrading to the next version and the next. They are often… with <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2006/10/11/a-first-quick-review-of-my-macbook-pro-17/">some exceptions</a>… well-designed and built to last. And, while I think the current Macbooks are even better designed and built to last even longer, you can be certain that soon after you get it, there will be another (incremental) upgrade, and another, eventually placing you in exactly the same boat you are now. In my opinion, it&#8217;s better to make best of what you have—you can still make make graphics with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7qUKv7XVx4">Photoshop 3</a>, for god&#8217;s sake—than being an upgrade junkie. Use-cases may vary.</p>
<p>There you have it, the psychology of one Mac-Man.</p>
<p>The end,<br />

Feel free to suggest some of your own in the comments.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">Quicksilver</a></strong> (systemwide, free): the mouse-killer. I use it to launch different apps, look up words in the dictionary, search google, and search for apps (it&#8217;s quicker than Spotlight). I could write a book on the many ways this app has improved my life.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextEXpander</a></strong> (systemwide, payware): for correcting my terrible spelling and changing all instances of &#8216;movie&#8217; into the British &#8216;film.&#8217; It also helps with long usernames like Kari&#8217;s @ksilvennoinen on Twitter ;).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a></strong> (systemwide, beta so far): a replacement for the regular screencapture, which allows you to add text, etc. quite easily to your pictures.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/quicklook.html"><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/quicklook.html"><strong>Quicklook</strong></a></a> (systemwide, comes with Leopard): adds preview-functions to just about any file and can be <a href="http://www.quicklookplugins.com/">added too</a> by third parties.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a></strong> (systemwide, free): notifications for different apps, ranging from iTunes to Adium.</li>
<li><a href="http://secrets.blacktree.com/"><strong>Secrets</strong></a> (Sytemwide, free): allows you to hack your mac.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/">Default Folder X</a></strong> (Systemwide, payware): adds things like favourite folders and history to your save-this-file dialogs. Huge time-saver!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/whatsnew/">Genius</a></strong> (free with iTunes): I cannot count the ways that I love this addition to the latest iTunes, but it&#8217;s really made my listening experience a 100 times better.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/saft">Saft</a></strong> (Safari*, payware): How I love thee. it allows me to add my own shortcuts for bookmarks (the default ones have already been reserved by Quicksilver). It also adds a number of tab-management functions, like focus on last selected tab.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://safariadblock.sourceforge.net/">Safari AdBlock</a></strong> (Safari*, free): it&#8217;s free and you can add <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions">publicly available lists</a> to it from Firefox&#8217;s Adblock. Works better than Saft&#8217;s for-pay adblocker.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">MailActOn</a></strong> (Mail, free afaik): adds short-cuts that you can use to shift mails to different categories.</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarklets</strong> (for any browser, mostly free): my current <a href="http://favourits.blogspot.com/2008/10/in-web-favourite-bookmarklets.html">favourites</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s about it! Which little gadgets do you use to improve the MacXperience?</p>
<p><em>Vincent</em></p>
<p>*: why I prefer Safari to Firefox (which supports more plugins): it launches insanely faster.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/vincent.vanwylick/SOfck0bD8bI/AAAAAAAAAu4/0d9PYWpGkXA/credit%20crunch.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="credit crunch.jpg" border="0" width="300" align="right" /><em>The matter of <a href="http://www.eurotopics.net/en/presseschau/archiv/aehnliche/archiv_article/ARTICLE36724-Europe-s-better-model-of-capitalism">Rhine Capitalism</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_economy">Anglo Saxon Capitalism</a>, referring to the battle between the capitalist system that has long reigned in the US vs. the more socialist system that came forth from European countries, is one that is on the table right now. The question is this: should we let the market be free, assuming that all information is perfect and hence that all decisions are rational? Or should there be a big brother figure, keeping an eye on market movements and stepping in when necessary?</em></p>
<p>More banally, should we be paying 50% of our income to regulators in the form of taxes, as it is common in my country, the Netherlands, and several more, or should we minimise that spending to a much lower figure, again betting that everything will sort itself out without expensive regulation? I think that anyone who&#8217;s ever had to fork out 30% or more of their hard-earned cash, wished that there was no government at one time or other. </p>
<p><strong>The fallacy of &#8220;freedom&#8221;</strong><br />
Getting back to free markets and the perfect distribution of information required to make rational decisions. I think it is clear that the latter is not the case. For information to be available to all, there should be no barriers to entry, everyone should be sufficiently sound of mind to process information and everyone should have access to it, either because it is &#8220;free&#8221; (paid for by taxes), or because they are wealthy enough to afford commercially collected information. </p>
<p>In other words, we are talking about at least middle-class income levels on a massive scale here, which correlates with education and job-prospects. We are also talking about basic education for everyone, the ability to make decisions based on accumulated intelligence. This is not the case in the US, nor any other country that endorses the &#8220;free market w/o government intervention&#8221; philosophy. </p>
<p><strong>The Credit Crunch and aftermath</strong><br />
More complex is the matter of the credit crunch, which hasn&#8217;t been happening on a level that you and me typically frequent; it has been going on between businesses, banks, and ultimately those taking out mortgages and those being shareholders of one of the companies involved. What happened here is 100% a free market problem on a global scale; the belief that investing in housing is a safe bet and the laissez-faire attitude of regulators towards the businesses involved. And the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=credit+crunch&amp;btnG=Search+News">aftermath</a>, which is that banks are being quasi-nationalised on a massive scale.</p>
<p>We are seeing the return of Rhine Capitalism, which has been waging a losing war since the Second World War.</p>
<p>Rhine Capitalism automatically comes with higher taxes. It comes with a re-empowerment of the government and the popular belief that, once again, the government is our parent with all the answers. Both the increase in taxes and the added income from the acquired banks also has another effect, that governments will be richer, will be able to, once again, afford to better provide for the general population, something that we have left to commercial parties in the last years, some of which has been good and some of which bad. This will hopefully lead to better education and perhaps even an alternative solution towards the masses of greying populations that we&#8217;ve all be told to fear.</p>
<p>Will it be good for business, the strongest voice opposed to Rhine Capitalism? No, certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>Rhine Capitalism isn&#8217;t the solution either</strong><br />
Yes, as my words show, I&#8217;m a firm believer in education for everyone, in lowering the barriers to entry for those of low income. I believe in empowerment of people and hope that it will lead to better decision-making on all sides. But I think that going back to the government being daddy is <em>devolution</em>, not evolution.</p>
<p>These last decades, we have seen plenty of progress, particularly on a technological scale, but also accompanied by plenty of others, facilitated by technology. We&#8217;ve seen massive developments in science, in logistics, in productivity. We&#8217;ve seen a greater awareness in people of global issues and the exchange of information, which has exploded. We&#8217;re half-way towards a world, where regulation is an automatic consequence of the fact that everything is becoming transparent.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will also see that issues like the credit crunch will no longer arise, because barriers to national data, to local data, to individual data will fall, allowing individuals and businesses managing their money, to make truly rational decisions.</p>
<p>What happened these last 15 months or so (perhaps even longer) is a warning shot, telling us that we&#8217;re not there yet. What happened this last week and the coming weeks is a consequence of exponential decisions based on negative emotions (mainly greed, fear, and ignorance). What should happen today and tomorrow is for people to use this as a lesson to shape our future world and build technology and systems that are designed to overcome these problems and replace the need for the current devolution towards an inefficient, but necessary system of regulation. </p>
<p>There is still a place for the government, as long as large portions of the global population are being suppressed. But, hopefully, it will actually do what it&#8217;s meant to meant to do, which is taking care of the people, instead of markets and businesses. But that is certainly something that will have to wait for several more years, until this current mess sorts itself out.</p>

Now, the rest is all about making it happen. You should also take my words with a grain of salt, as I&#8217;ve been accused of being very goal-orientated before. Goal orientation is something like: taking climbing lessons to eventually climb the highest mountain or writing a thesis to fix a country. I set the bar pretty high, which is meant to motivate, but which can just as easily intimidate (me included). </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s post is about writing as I woke up with a thought about it.  Blogging is an area with extremely low barriers to entry, which is why so many blogs exist. Anyone can blog and tell a story. But not everyone has a story to tell. </em></p>
<p>The great writers, which some of us dream to become perhaps, didn&#8217;t write to just write. They had, I imagine, a fire within them, that burned them day after day to produce what would eventually become a great asset in someone&#8217;s library. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking Nelson Mandella&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Walk-Freedom-Autobiography-Mandela/dp/1586216880/?tag=reviewrus-20">Long walk to Freedom</a>,&#8221; Ram Charan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-CEO-Wants-You-Know/dp/0609608398/?tag=reviewrus-20">What the CEO wants you to know</a>&#8221; (the equivalent of a blogpost of just the right size in books), Howard Schultz&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pour-Your-Heart-into-Starbucks/dp/0786883561/?tag=reviewrus-20">Pour your heart into it</a>,&#8221; (reviewed <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/07/28/starbucks-an-example-of-vertical-integration/">here</a>), and many more which are on my shelves at home. </p>
<p>These books were written by people that had life-experience and just had to share that with the rest of the world. Sure they researched, but more often than not these author in particular just poured out the words. Even &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Genghis-Khan-Making-Modern-World/dp/0609610627/?tag=reviewrus-20">Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world</a>,&#8221; which I&#8217;m currently reading, was written by a professor that travelled the grasslands that gave birth to Khan (for an idea of how that would like visually, check out &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416044/">Mongul</a>&#8220;).</p>
<p>The point is that today I wanted to write about writing, because I&#8217;ve written a lot, too much, before in my life. I started blogging just to write, not having a clue what I would do with it.  But I&#8217;m more and more of the opinion that the written language was created to preserve that which you want to <em>communicate</em> over time and to many people during its lifetime. </p>
<p>When you want to blog something, think about it a little (or don&#8217;t) and then just write that which you want to say. As soon as you start going down the path of having to still research what you&#8217;re going to say while you&#8217;re writing (a sure sign that you&#8217;ll end up talking out of your you-know-where), give up the writing, let the new information digest and try again the next day. Writing is a joy to read and to write when it flows. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><img src="http://jeremyfain.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/consolidation.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="consolidation.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="300" align="right" />I have to say that I (Vincent) am a little baffled by the amount of effort that goes into IT or ICT. I thought we had these discussions some years ago and the general consensus was: IT is <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/01/it_doesnt_matte.php">not</a> the source of sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Yet, when I opened my Economist from two weeks ago (I&#8217;m always a few weeks behind), an <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12304825">article</a> mentioned that with this credit crunch, mergers and acquisitions are going down, and with that a major cash-cow for consultants: <em>IT systems consolidation</em>.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m wondering why companies, particularly those young babies being acquired, are still working with proprietary systems? Is there some kind of competitive advantage to doing it &#8220;your own way?&#8221; Or is that simply a myth that people believe in?</p>
<p>For myself, I&#8217;ve whined a-plenty about how Excel sucks and Powerpoint sucks, and how I&#8217;d like to have software work in my &#8220;right-brained way.&#8221; But I still believe that Excel and Powerpoint works fine for 95% of the population and for 95% of the time, and that there is no need for a custom-built solution on that—the administrative—end.</p>
<p>There is of course multiple sides to IT, particularly if you are an <em>IT-company</em> or one where IT plays a leading role. Let&#8217;s take Amazon, which won&#8217;t be acquired anytime soon, which relies heavily on its proprietary technologies, being so specialised that it decided to become an IT-service-provider. Or Lucas Arts, which develops effects for films, also 3rd party, and will certainly use custom-built software.</p>
<p>But when I think IT-consolidation, I think databases, and I&#8217;m wondering if one database is better than the other. And I&#8217;m wondering, why there isn&#8217;t a standard for this yet, as the Amazon&#8217;s of this world are clearly pushing for it.</p>
<p>What am I missing here? Why do we need consultants again? Why aren&#8217;t we doing everything in the cloud?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><em>Hello, it&#8217;s Vincent and I propose a coup: I will take over Tech IT Easy as, at the very least, head-editor and/or, at the very most, vice-president, after our revered founder, Jeremy Fain, who is busy with <a href="http://en.verteeblog.com">other things</a> now. Say &#8216;<strong>Yay</strong>&#8216; or &#8216;<strong>Nay</strong>&#8216; in the comments. Of course, the only reason I would do so is because I&#8217;m tired of introducing myself in the intro for the 5th time this week, though I would like the less frequent bloggers to do so, please. This is my first decree. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s post is a little public brainstorm on where I would like to see Tech IT Easy go. This is a follow-up to my <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2008/09/28/group-blogging-and-the-barriers-to-blog/">last post</a> from last week.</em></p>
<p><strong>Positioning!</strong><br />
Bearing in mind the 4 C&#8217;s of positioning: <em>Continuity, Clarity, Competitiveness, and Confidence</em>, where would we like to see Tech IT Easy go, both from the blogger&#8217;s perspective as well as <strong>You</strong>, the reader?</p>
<p><strong>My position!</strong><br />
I have some thoughts on this. Any blog needs a goal, and so far we have not made this goal very explicit, though we each have one. For me this goal is not to write, far from it, rather it&#8217;s the exchange of ideas and the meeting of people. I have taken blogging on Tech IT Easy very seriously, taking it beyond this webpage and contacting people directly to help me with my many questions. </p>
<p>When I look for a job, I talk to my friends, when I want to start a business, I talk to my friends. And they are all more than welcome to talk to me. That said, friendship is contextual! I don&#8217;t believe in non-sollicited contact, as a matter of fact if people send requests to us about &#8220;reviewing&#8221; their website, etc., I more than often ignore it, because for them it&#8217;s cheap marketing and for me and you it&#8217;s rarely worth anything. Rather, a relationship is something you work on, together, and which comes out of shared experiences.</p>
<p>From my perspective, <strong>Tech IT Easy is a relationship-building tool</strong>. We don&#8217;t use it for marketing <em>ourselves</em>, but we use it to <em>build relationships</em> with the world around us so that we <u>all</u> become smarter people.</p>
<p>I would like <strong>you</strong> co-bloggers and readers to chime in on this, via the comments (or <a href="mailto:techiteasyblog@gmail.com">mail</a>, if necessary).</p>
<p><strong>How to get there!</strong><br />
If we agree that Tech IT Easy is about relationship-building, both internally and externally, then we have to continue with defining a good &#8220;relationship.&#8221; </p>
<p>In come the 4 C&#8217;s again.
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Continuity:</u></strong> A good relationship is ongoing, which means that you have to nurture it and dedicate time to it. To blog here, to build that relationship, <strong>you have to commit to blog at least once a month</strong>. <em>Basta!</em> I&#8217;m currently working in 1.5 part-time ventures, and even I can make time for 1 post a month, even when I move on to more full-time engagements. I&#8217;ll keep track of this and you can of course always talk to me about it. And if a conversation is started, you have to keep it going somehow, as well. You are responsible for your content <em>and</em> the conversation!</li>
<li><strong><u>Clarity:</u></strong> A good relationship has well-defined values, meaning that <strong>your posts must be clear and relevant to you and your readers</strong>. If you&#8217;re writing for just yourself, you better make it a topic that other people want to read about too. And you have read and re-read your words to see if your message comes across.</li>
<li><strong><u>Competitiveness:</u></strong> Be continuous, be clear, and 99% of this is done. Don&#8217;t write crap, don&#8217;t plagiarise, don&#8217;t post videos that add no value to anyone, and… don&#8217;t write crap.<strong> Have a take on the world that is just your own and which we can debate</strong>. That&#8217;s the other 1%!</li>
<li><strong><u>Confidence:</u></strong> If you believe in yourself to be an ongoing presence on Tech IT Easy, if you know that you write clearly, if you know that you write competitively, then you can be <em>confident</em> that all of us, bloggers and readers, will have your back… even beyond blogging, in whatever venture or activity you want to engage in. You want to climb a mountain, I can help you. You want to be a musician, Cecil can help you. You want to solve the credit crunch, Kari can (probably) help you. You want to start a company, many here can help you. <strong>Be good, be there, and we love you</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sustainable models!</strong><br />
I&#8217;m going to steal one of Verteeblog&#8217;s <a href="http://www.emeraldvision.eu/verteego/blog/en/index.php/2008/10/01/what-is-sustainable-business/">graphs</a> now. Sustainability can be interpreted in many different ways, but to me it means that whatever energy you expend, must come back to you somehow. The same applies to blogging.<br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/640px-Sustainable_development.svg.png" width="400"><br />
What are our <strong>expenditures</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Time spent blogging</li>
<li>Money spent on this domain, etc. (we will leave this out of the equation for now)</li>
<li>Time spent marketing (which is really blogging)</li>
<li>Time spent recruiting (which is really blogging)</li>
</ol>
<p>What is our <strong>income</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Life experience, which leads to new ideas</li>
<li>Feedback through comments and email, which leads to new ideas</li>
<li>New bloggers, which makes our hive smarter</li>
</ol>
<p>Sustainability on Tech IT Easy comes from doing the first 4 well (respecting the 4 C&#8217;s), and the last 3 will follow automatically!</p>
<p>This is my vision, regarding the future of Tech IT Easy and I will try my best to set that example. </p>
<p>As always, I appreciate your comments and feedback (except if your feedback is that I write too textbook—I am who I am).</p>
<p><em>Vincent</em> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><em>Hi, my name is <a href="http://techiteasy.org/author/vincevanwylick">Vincent</a>, a now-familiar face in Tech IT Easy&#8217;s blogging family, and today I&#8217;d like to write about my thoughts about startups&#8217; reasons to fail (and as a consequence: reasons to succeed). This is my 3rd non-tech topic in a row, and if you hadn&#8217;t guessed it, I have little inspiration to write about tech these days.</em></p>
<p>So, &#8220;why do startups fail?&#8221; seems to be a relevant question these days and I guess to everyone running or thinking about running or working in a startup. Depending on who you talk to, no actually pretty much everyone, over 90% of startups fail within 2 years of their launch. The stats vary according to whom the startup works with, it is much lower with venture-funded companies, as well as within certain incubators.</p>
<p><strong>The Credit Crunch</strong><br />
One of the most popular reasons I heard while writing my thesis (which involved me interviewing over 200 tech-startups), is of course <em>lack of money</em>. That seems really relevant today, and is certainly a factor. </p>
<p>To give a personal example of how the credit crunch is affecting our lives negatively, back when I started a bachelor in Manchester, UK, about 10 years ago, I was able to get a student-loan quite easily at a British bank. You walk in with your details, get a 1000 pounds overdraft and a credit-card to boot. This was still the case until a few months ago. My brother, who just left for Lancaster, UK, was counting on a similar deal. But banks had withdrawn that service to non-UK citizen, rather abruptly, forcing my brother to find alternative solutions. Banks don&#8217;t care about who needs or deserves a loan, when they cut it off, we&#8217;re all screwed.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/09/my-thoughts-on.html">pointed out</a> that seed-funding will likely suffer most, and true, banks are, both directly and indirectly, an incredibly important source in that arena, as well as at later stages. The graph below showed my own results, for two measures carried out during 2005 and 2006 on the investment climate for high-tech startups in the Netherlands (a Dutch version of that report can be downloaded <a href="http://technopartner.nl/wiki/pionierkapitaal/onderzoeken_kapitaal_en_technostarters/nederlands_investeringsklimaat_voor_technostarters">here</a>).</p>

<p>What this graph also shows is that even pre-credit crunch, most startups didn&#8217;t use or weren&#8217;t able to use much beyond their own savings (the turquoise part) at the seed and sometimes the later stage (of course that still includes credit cards and similar bank-related funding sources). No way that this is something that should be generalised across all countries of course, I imagine that the distribution of investors will vary quite substantially from country to country.</p>
<p><strong>Forget funding</strong><br />
I happen to think that funding is not the factor to focus on when talking about startup failure. In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_market">perfect financial market</a>, which,  many financial people try to convince me, exists, you get funding if other conditions are in place. Receiving an investment is a <em>validation of your idea</em>, and if you <em>can&#8217;t</em> get investors to talk to you it&#8217;s either because:
<ol>
<li>Your idea is bad.</li>
<li>Your presentation is bad.</li>
<li>There are too many similar startups applying for funding.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key here is then for 1. to improve your idea, for 2. to improve your presentation, and for 3. to stop being a sheep and reinventing the mousetrap. While this makes me sound like an asshole, the point is that none of these reasons have to do with funding, they have to do with the quality of your venture.</p>
<p><strong>Non-financial reasons for failing</strong><br />
A startup is a <em>machine</em> that needs to be built, needs to operated and maintained, and needs to produce sufficient output/income to cover the costs that building, operating, and maintaining require.</p>
<p>Therefore, startup-failure is related to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Too expensive a building-process</strong> (both in money, people, and time), which comes out of bad planning and insufficient skillsets to get results.</li>
<li><strong>Improper operation and maintenance</strong>, which is really to do with bad HR-practices.</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient output/income</strong>, which can be related to the quantity produced (bad planning, skills), bad pricing, and of course a bad market.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8220;bad market&#8221; factor is an interesting one, because it seems very related to the credit crunch problem. My brother, who is forced to look elsewhere for funding, will be less likely to buy a laptop from the start now. Everything ties back into funding somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Bad market or bad business-model?</strong><br />
The top <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model">business models</a>, in my mind, are built to <em>withstand recession</em>. Some could argue that they are built <em>during</em> a recession. An example of this is discounters like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi">Aldi</a>, which was built in a poor Germany, many years ago, and has caused a revolution in European retailing. Im not 100% sure, but I think that the strength of European discounters here has even prevented monsters like Wal Mart from taking over the place.</p>
<p>Other streams of thought about this take you into &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy">blue ocean</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">long tail</a>&#8221; territory, both somewhat hip ways of saying that you should <em>think outside the box</em>. </p>
<p>A bad market can be a lack of desire on consumers part to pay for your product. And it can be that the market is simply to small, suggesting that it may be a good idea to think globally from the start. Certainly, investors like the idea of entrepreneurs thinking (realistically) big. Also when you see some of the industry-growth-stats in emerging economies, it makes sense to target those markets, instead of the many 0-2% growth economies in the Western world.</p>
<p>I guess what I&#8217;m saying is that a bad market is just an excuse for failure.  If your business is advertising dependent, you should  be aware that most advertisers cut their spending during recessions, a recession that has been predicted for years now. The same applies to certain luxury goods, etc. So, perhaps the market isn&#8217;t bad, perhaps the business-model is bad too. </p>
<p><strong>In summary…</strong><br />
Yes, the credit crunch is scary, as are all recessions. Yes, we would all like our ideas to simply be output - input = profit. But the core of entrepreneurship is to think in opportunities, to not get stuck in ideas, and be market-focussed. It is about breaking rules and making new ones. And, while it is a harsh world where failure is accompanied by a high price, at the core of entrepreneurship is also optimism—the belief that everything can be solved with the right perspective.</p>
<p>So why do startups fail? By setting themselves up to fail.</p>
