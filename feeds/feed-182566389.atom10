		<description>Im not a whizz with this but i picked one up and its rubbish, either that or i havent mastered the 'easy-to-use' side of it?!   

It keeps dropping the connection even though it says signal strength is excellent.  No firmware updates available either, im pretty disappointed.  Have a laptop and a desktop.  None are wired but with this peice of kit i should be ok, no?  

I even bought the N1 usb adapter that goes with this, disabled my network adapters and stuck with that.  still drops the connection, if i disconnect then reconnect it works but i have to to do this at least once every five minutes.

Can anyone advise?</description>

		<title>Comment on Preventing content from "shifting" for Adblockers by AJ Styles</title>

		<description>I guess I want to chime in with a controversial thought -- should people block ads at all? Considering so much valuable web content is delivered "for free" by people who generate it, hoping to reap rewards from advertising.  If more and more people block advertising and advertising revenue drops as a result, it's possible content quality will decline.</description>
