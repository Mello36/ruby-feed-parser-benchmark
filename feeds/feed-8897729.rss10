<title>Making dispatchEvent More Efficient</title>
<link>http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/12/making_dispatch.html</link>
<description>In most projects there are tons of events that are dispatched, but have no listeners subscribed to them. This shouldn&apos;t be an issue, but it turns out that the Flash Player deals with these events inefficiently. Luckily it&apos;s pretty easy to patch this for specific situations. The code below will run about 5X faster than a standard dispatchEvent call when...</description>

<title>Always Export a Release Build</title>
<link>http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/12/always_export_a.html</link>
<description>When preparing a Flex project for deployment, always make sure to export a release build. I think most people know about this feature of FlexBuilder, but I&apos;m not sure everyone is aware of just how important it is. The SWF that is generated when you run or debug your project contains a lot of extra byte code used for debugging and profiling your content.</description>

<title>Curly Braces: To Cuddle or Not?</title>
<link>http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/11/curly_braces_to.html</link>
<description>Should you place curly braces on the same line as the statement (cuddle), or on the next line? It&apos;s a debate that has raged for years, and is unlikely to be resolved until curly braces in code become obsolete. Despite that, I thought I would share my opinion on the topic.</description>

<link>http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/11/gtween_beta_3_a.html</link>
<description>I&apos;ve just wrapped up beta 3 of gTween. The main feature additions are support for 3D rotation with smartRotation (always rotates in the shortest direction), a rewrite of custom progress points to make them more robust and reliable, the addition of a global defaultEase property, and the ability to globally control what properties will be rounded.</description>

<title>The Great Pumpkin Showdown, 2008</title>

<description>Keeping with our yearly tradition of squash mutilation here at gskinner.com, I&apos;m happy to present this year&apos;s Great Pumpkin Showdown. We broke into teams of two, based on seniority, and hacked the crap out of a bunch of defenseless pumpkins while drinking beer, eating pizza, and gorging on candy.  Also keeping with tradition, we made the most recent hires build out the pumpkin voting team.</description>

<description>Simple tech demo showing a 3D music visualizer using the flash player 10&apos;s new 3D APIs.

<description>In May I blogged about Adobe acquiring gProject from us. At the time, I wasn&apos;t allowed to talk about what it was going to be used for. Still, it probably doesn&apos;t come as a huge surprise to anyone that the new Project Panel in Flash CS4 is based on gProject. Some of the key features...</description>

<description>We&apos;ve been able to spend some time polishing the Flash player 10 feature tour we built with Adobe, adding more demos, integrating videos, and redesigning it with Adobe&apos;s Double Identity theme. It shows some basic demos for a few of the new features, with downloadable source code - including a simple coverflow sample.</description>

<title>Beware the AIR Badger!!</title>
<link>http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/09/beware_the_air.html</link>
<description>A while back, I thought it would be a neat idea to build an AIR application that made it easier to configure and deploy badge installers. Adobe agreed, and the Badger application was created... Badger allows you to load a template install badge, configure all of its options, preview it live (via the HTML control in AIR), and then export it for deployment. Badger also takes the pain out of configuring badges by...</description>
