Given that quite a few Microsofties are going to find themselves locked into their current group for a while, the ability to succeed by swinging on the vines to a new group is going to be rare. Within the comments, I hope to elicit advice that follows up on what I start here, and maybe even contradicts it. I'm interested in hearing your stories of success, mentorship, and turning a career that was off-path back on-track. For the folks on the path to L63, I want you to first understand your boss's opinion of you, your opinion of yourself, what it takes to succeed in your team, and then ways you can step up and be on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let's Hear it for the Boy! Let's Hear it for the Girl! &lt;/b&gt;If you reach L63 during your time at Microsoft, especially if you started at L60 or below, you should celebrate. Here's to you! What an achievement! You have the right stuff to succeed and Microsoft is very happy with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L63 is very much an important milestone, and in tough-hiring times like these the following question has never been more important: "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Will &amp;lt;&amp;lt;fill in the blank&amp;gt;&amp;gt; reach Level 63 during their career?&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not there yet and your boss was asked that question by your skip-level-boss, what is your boss's answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you know for sure that your boss's answer is an immediate "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/span&gt;" you need to hit the pause button for one big time-out regarding where you are, where you're going, and what needs to change. And I'm going to tell you right now, I'm 99.9% sure what needs to change is you. Because, except on the rare occasion, Microsoft and your team isn't going to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until L63, you can pretty continue to be promoted based on raw talent to get things done smartly and efficiently. Things get thrown your way and you knock each and everyone of the challenges out of the park. Then perhaps you're stuck at L62. What got you here ain't gonna get you there. What now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think Locally:&lt;/b&gt; remember three years back when we talked about the book &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/12/confidential-mercurial-comments.html"&gt;Corporate Confidential&lt;/a&gt;? It's a good time to flip back through that. One of the key lessons is to know &lt;b&gt;who is the gate keeper for your career&lt;/b&gt;. Pop quiz: who is it? Think about it. Ready? Let's compare answers... answer is: your boss. Your lead. The person who puts you up for promotion and has promotion conversations with your skip level. It's a question your boss gets asked so it's not a surprise to them. Your boss should already have about a year-long plan about who on the team is getting promoted when - it's essential for team promotion budget planning. And when the time comes, putting you up for a promotion to L63 is the first time your boss will be challenged by your skip-level and by your Aunt and Uncles (&lt;i&gt;your boss's peers&lt;/i&gt;) about one of your promotions. It's hard for L63. Harder for L64. And a knife-fight for L65 (&lt;i&gt;some other day&lt;/i&gt;). They will have thought this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're saying "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Ah, dude, my boss is in the way of my promotion&lt;/span&gt;" then all I have to say is "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Duuuude, your boss is the way to your promotion.&lt;/span&gt;" Perhaps someone can explain to me how you get successfully promoted without your boss's support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So honestly, what is your boss's answer about if you'll reach L63? If it is "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/span&gt;" then the follow-up is: after what accomplishments and around when?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Recently Promoted L63 Peers&lt;/b&gt;: let's say you have at least one peer that in the past year or so has been promoted to L63. Why? Do you know why? Specifically, what did they accomplish, and what contributions do you see them doing to justify their promotion? Write it down in a team-culture career section you keep in OneNote (&lt;i&gt;start that section now if you don't have it&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now read over your answer. If you're going into that comfort zone of complaining about politics and butt-kissing and favorites, do me this favor: hold your right palm up, nice and flat like you're about to be sworn in to testify in a trial, and now extend your right arm out nice and wide, and then quickly swing your right arm around the front of you in a nice arc that ends with the flat of your right hand quickly connecting to the left side of your face for a hard, resounding slap. Repeat. Alternate to your left hand appropriately when tired. Continue to do so until you've slapped yourself silly to the point that you're not complaining about how other folks must just be connected or political or adept at the finer art of buttock tongue massage. Excuses and griping and bemoaning aren't the stuff that L63 contributors are made of. So either keep slapping yourself or choose to wake up. Until you can be honest with yourself (&lt;i&gt;and it's not fun, trust me&lt;/i&gt;) you will be stuck doing what you're doing and your complaining will be the glue keeping you there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turn (it) Around, Bright Eyes&lt;/b&gt;: every now and then I get a little bit thrilled when someone joins the team straight out of school (&lt;i&gt;or with a little industry experience&lt;/i&gt;) and after a few months it's obvious that Microsoft is the best company for them. They just plain resonate. They are 100% star material. Will they reach L63? &lt;b&gt;Absolutely&lt;/b&gt;. And on one total-eclipse-rare occasion, I've been able to be answer the follow-up question: will they reach L65 and say with confidence: &lt;b&gt;Absolutely&lt;/b&gt;. Well, what about everyone else? Sometimes the answer is, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;well, we'll see...&lt;/span&gt;" and other times the answer is, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;if they'd only stop doing X and start doing Y on a sustained basis, I could see it...&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not an Absolutely! then do you know what more you need to do? And in your answer, there's a kicker follow-up: not only what you need to do to justify being promoted to L63, but to succeed in comparison to your L63 + L64 peers. For some teams - especially those like Office with few departures release-to-release resulting in level compression - that's a rough bunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen people turn it around. If you're off-path, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can turn it around. You first have to be truthful with what direction you're going in and where you actually are trying to head. Get yourself a formal or informal mentor who is already doing what you want to be doing. Successful people looooove to expound upon the secret to their success. Some can even challenge you and give you the tough love and direction you need. Buy a Principal a coffee. There is no better investment at Microsoft for tuning your career. When someone gives you the hard advice to succeed, it's quite the gift. Don't waste it. It's a lot better than folks being ambivalent about your success or failure, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Team&lt;/b&gt;: you have to be able to understand why the L63s and L64s are where they are. You might have the Microsoft Senior Career Stage Profile in front of you all marked up and broken into more sections in OneNote, but which ones matter most to your team? And to your boss. And to your skip level. If your boss is saying "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Yes, ready for promo now&lt;/span&gt;" and your skip is saying "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;No, not now&lt;/span&gt;" well, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aspects of an L63 Contributor&lt;/b&gt;: some random aspects that come to my mind beyond our CSPs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;They can own a room&lt;/i&gt;: they aren't warming a seat but rather can take charge of a conversation and represent such a deep level of knowledge that they gain respect for what they say and earn a good reputation. Their focus stays on accountable results and this person can bring resolution and closure together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expert&lt;/i&gt;: They are sought after to be in meetings, for instance, so that good decisions can be made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results-focused&lt;/i&gt;: they are focused on getting great results and don't entwine their ego to particular solutions. They don't get defensive if their ideas are revealed to have flaws but rather delight in being able to move to a better solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leadership&lt;/i&gt;: pro-active leadership that convinces team members of the future direction and even helps to implement it. This is a big difference between those who can complain about the way things should be and those you can actually bring it about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solutions, not problems&lt;/i&gt;: following up on the above, they aren't complaining about problems on the team but rather implementing and driving solutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Makes other great&lt;/i&gt;: the team benefits and grows from the person's contributions. Answers questions from the team, from support, from customers. Knows what the team delivers backwards and forwards. They are a good mentor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Influence when they can, scare when they must&lt;/i&gt;: they have fundamental skills in influencing people, but if they need to flip into junk-yard dog mode, they can. They don't give up and walk away but rather fight when they need to fight, escalating only when needed and with lots of justification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Makes the boss great:&lt;/i&gt; if the team and your boss are succeeding because of you, of course you'll be succeeding too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not doing it for the promotion&lt;/i&gt;: if you're out for a promotion, don't do work specifically chose to get the promotion. This is like meeting the Buddha on the road. If you come up with a pretty plan to justify your promotion, you've already lost it. Such plotting is obvious and actually detrimental to your career. If, however, you've determined what it takes to have a successful career in your group at Microsoft and have started what you need to start and stopped what you need to stop, then you're on the right path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I write all of this, I think back to an older piece by &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/12/06.html"&gt;Joel Spolsky talking about Rosh Gadol&lt;/a&gt; contributors. Be the Rosh Gadol Microsoftie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, go mine some of Dr. Brechner's &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_brechner/"&gt;Hard Code&lt;/a&gt; columns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No, never&lt;/b&gt;: now, going back to that &amp;lt;&amp;lt;fill in the blank&amp;gt;&amp;gt; question above: if your boss is answering "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;No, never&lt;/span&gt;" then this is a red-alert moment for you. Flip on the klaxons! Why? Because when it comes time to roll people out of the team (&lt;i&gt;as teams do from time to time&lt;/i&gt;) this "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;No, never&lt;/span&gt;" a marker that is used to help figure out who - at I and II CSP levels - is either on-track or out. If the answer for you is "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt;" and you don't like that, well, what are you going to do? I suggest understanding why it is "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt;" first, truthfully accepting the point-of-view as pissed off as it may make you, and then having a self-directed action-plan to get on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;: First off, I'm going to be hard-core about comments here. I want them productive and about career success at Microsoft, especially your thoughts about achieving L63. What advice do you have to pass on? What advice do you need? What worked well and what really horked things up for you? If you're a manager, what's your L63 promotion philosophy? I'm not looking for any off-topic comments let alone woe-be-me comments - remember that slap thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an itching to talk about something else, please go here: &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/11/but-mini-i-want-to-talk-about.html"&gt;But Mini, I Want To Talk About...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/4176051506838520816/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=4176051506838520816' title='75 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4176051506838520816'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4176051506838520816'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/11/achieving-senior-level-63-at-microsoft.html' title='Achieving Senior Level 63 at Microsoft'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>75</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-934323819421337976</id><published>2008-11-15T19:14:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-15T19:16:31.692-08:00</updated><title type='text'>But Mini, I Want To Talk About...</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Don't want to talk about reaching L63 at Microsoft and bummed that I've locked down the comment stream on that post to be my way or the cutting-room-floor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell you what I'll do: I'll put this post up to have a post to riff within, but still stay within my commenting guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's on your mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who's still hiring at Microsoft?

(&lt;i&gt;shakes head&lt;/i&gt;) It makes me want to sing to the Talking Heads about how this is not my beautiful house. It's a solution. It will solve problems. Are they really the right problems, and therefore, is it really the right solution?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kudos for a great PDC / Win7 debut. I'm drawing hearts around my sketch of SteveSi... and littles x's and o's... ahem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On that theme: since the Company Meeting 2008, I've felt that we've turned a corner. A good corner. Do you agree, and if not, what do you believe has to happen for Microsoft to have turned the corner onto the freeway of success?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What topics would you like to see discussed in future posts?

While it can be buffeted back in forth in a mild recession and get through without group parties here and there, it's pretty unclear what kind of Microsoft will emerge at the other end of a deep global recession. Just a quick post about the immediate staffing impact as we head towards quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First: thank whatever deity you hold dear that we didn't go forward with that Yahoo! acquisition. How crazy would that look now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, organizations are being told to &lt;b&gt;eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/b&gt;. For different organizations this means some pretty radically different action items. For some parts of Microsoft, this means hiring freezes. While hiring freezes aren't any fun (&lt;i&gt;more below&lt;/i&gt;) you probably prefer them to full-blown Reduction in workForce (&lt;i&gt;RIFs... though I guess that would be called RIWs or RIWFs&lt;/i&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we need, though, is one big RIF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an unfortunate consequence to hiring freezes for Microsofties: those ready to move on to a new position are stuck because there is no where to go and, even worse, those who have already gone through an interview loop are having their offers frozen out. Also, any attrition is not going to be backfilled and the org loses that headcount. Let's talk about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now first of all, I'm all for reducing Microsoft's headcount. I was for that, what, 40,000 hires ago? Microsoft's key asset and key overhead are the Microsoft employees. You reduce that right, you save a bunch of money. And it is not just a one time saving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm all for good and bad attrition. But I'm concerned about implementing unhealthy policies vs. just a one big 10% or 20% reduction all-around (&lt;i&gt;we've identified 10%-ers already right - at least 10% Situation I-ers&lt;/i&gt;). If you do this big and once and you can still backfill future attrition and let people move around the company into new positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unhealthy for Microsoft to lock people into their jobs, which might be the reality for the next half-year to a year. I want the most talented Microsofties to - as their current commitments come to a close - look around the company and find new challenges to move to. It makes for stronger careers building our future leaders and creates stronger results. It also makes bad teams fail sooner by loosing key contributors. What's even worse, perhaps for planning, is that people will be locked and not moving on during a natural product cycle rhythm coming up (&lt;i&gt;major product groups, for instance, going into stability&lt;/i&gt;), and these same people, once headcount reopens in the future, will be abandoning their commitments mid-way. Uncool. Unsurprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for being told "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Hey, we're not going to let you fill your attrition.&lt;/span&gt;" Well, what group, let alone empire builders, is going to move on bad contributors now? Better to limp along than have reduced capacity. Not even that alluring, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Wouldn't you want to move-on that plateau'd L61 person with a hot college new-hire?&lt;/span&gt;" works now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some comments on this. First a &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/09/compensatory-arrangements-of-certain.html?showComment=1224370620000#c4538565144492342088"&gt;common hit on most teams&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;time to talk about layoffs. Hiring is frozen and teams are being told to reduce head-count through attrition. Sounds like layoffs to me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when you want to &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/09/compensatory-arrangements-of-certain.html?showComment=1224304980000#c949903343018326170"&gt;move internally&lt;/a&gt; and have already interviewed (&lt;i&gt;oy!&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any updates on the hiring freeze anyone? I desperately want to get out of my current team but teams I have interviewed with are withholding offers because of this damn freeze...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/09/compensatory-arrangements-of-certain.html?showComment=1224140100000#c4496893096119404647"&gt;excellent manifesto on hiring freeze for talented contributors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What the Hiring Freeze Means to Me - An Open Letter to HR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am high performer, a gold star winner, have a relatively high level and I have a problem.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In an all too common scenario, my group was re-orged and I was given a new manager. As is many times the case, this manager is well regarded for his technical skills but is absolutely an abysmal manager. He has little aptitude or interest in actually managing his people and still operates like he's an IC.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Multiple members on the team have gone to the new manager, as well as the skip level manager to discuss the situation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The skip level manager now has a dilemma - does he support the manager, and help him grow into the role? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If he does, it will clearly take 6+ months, and this is on top of the 3 months it took the team to muster the courage to escalate to the skip level manager to begin with. If the manager stays and doesn't improve, myself and the people on his team will surely take a hit at review time at the end of the year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In our case, the manager doesn't know what to do. He's thinking about it, and in fairness we recognize he's in a tough spot. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the while, though, the clock is ticking, and the high performers on the team are looking for the exits. We're demotivated, demoralized, and are placed in a position where we cant realize our potential.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most people reading this are likely nodding their heads. This happens here. Alot.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Typically when this happens, employees see this as an opportunity to explore another part of the company, and round out our experience. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But not today. There's a hiring freeze, no internal transfers are allowed, and we're stuck. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We've done the appropriate thing, we've talked with our manager and our skip level manager. We're now in a weird limbo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of course this comes at a time when we're in a down economy, and in many respects lucky to have our jobs. We're sure as heck not going to rock the boat any more than we already have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This seems to leave to options. The first is to suffer in silence, the second is to leave the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neither of these options are good for us or for Microsoft. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our group is not alone. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'd ask you to consider four things:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1) New rule - anyone new to people management is on a trial basis for the first year, to be reviewed and renewed quarterly. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(2) New rule - anyone new to people management shouldn't be given a team of more than two people. If they do a good job with two, go to five, and so on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(3) Make managers of managers responsible for their appointments. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you put a bad manager in place, and you don't resolve the issue after 1-2 quarters, you take a percentage hit on bonus and stock. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This will result in people spending more time in the decision making process for this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(4) Allow for internal transfers, atleast for higher level positions. When you take high leveled, high performers and you put them in a position where they can't be high performers due to poor management, they either leave or grow demoralized and become less productive to accomodate a bad manager. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eventually, this second group also leaves, with the ones that don't downgrading to average performers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snippet &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/09/compensatory-arrangements-of-certain.html?showComment=1224097920000#c5493631342869300940"&gt;to re-enforce that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internal is frozen, too, for the most part. I see Live and MSN technical openings, and various business-oriented ones. I had just seen a couple positions for which I wanted to do informationals. Before the hiring managers and I met, they both called me and said that they had just been told that couldn't hire anyone for the time being.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's really my time to leave my team, because the three year timer is ticking and I'm topped out in my org given the kind of work management wants it to do. I'm capable of more, but the level of work isn't there. When I've tried to just go get it, I've caught flack from management - because I was taking on actual business risk that scared them, instead of the safe work our team usually does. I don't like the online services biz, so I hope the powers that be finish evaluating the business climate and open up a few more product heads in profitable divisions sometime soon. My preference is PM or dev in Exchange, as I'd like to contribute to that. But at this point, any core product would be interesting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that this is an opportunity for major change vs. aloof delegated inefficiency hunting, but major change has to come from SteveB. If need be, the global climate gives Microsoft cover to make big revamps. E.g., "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;...the economy made us do these big cut-backs vs. us doing what we should have been doing all-along.&lt;/span&gt;" It is too soon to expect this during this week's quarterly results, but within the next quarter, as the impact to reduced global PC sales becomes apparent, we should be ready to announce some major overhead reduction (&lt;i&gt;e.g., not towels but rather less butts for said towels to dry - win-win&lt;/i&gt;). And remember: you cut once and you cut deep. Incremental pain is unhealthy and all that you're doing is poisoning your teams and setting up a huge round of bad attrition once things turn around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine each one of you wants to make your team better and more productive and streamlined, and have ideas for your team and beyond. This is an excellent time for our HR leadership to re-engage Microsofties plus finally join the 21st century and implement team-focused awards. Yes, we would still offer differentiated awards, but team achievements must be recognized with the same level of attention that our super-star hero culture is given. Who doesn't want an excellent team to be rewarded, let alone dysfunctional underperforming teams torn apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if your team had to get by with 10% less budget, how do you think it would be best addressed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/781780406043436132/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=781780406043436132' title='109 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/781780406043436132'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/781780406043436132'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/10/is-microsoft-recession-proof.html' title='Is Microsoft Recession Proof?'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>109</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-1105063783646655309</id><published>2008-09-25T19:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-25T19:34:15.191-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Compensatory Arrangements of Certain (Microsoft) Officers</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I saw today that Microsoft filed a Form 8-K. The initial financial news blurb really didn't get my attention and it put in my mental queue to read later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Brier Dudley went and read it and blogged this post: &lt;a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/brierdudley/2008/09/25/microsofts_new_bonus_plan_for.html"&gt;Brier Dudley's blog Microsoft's new bonus plan for Steve Ballmer, et al Up to $20 mil apiece&lt;/a&gt;. Snippet: &lt;i&gt;Instead of the current mix of cash bonuses and stock awards, executive bonuses will come from a pool - for fiscal 2009, that pool is the equivalent to 0.35 percent of the company's annual operating income during the year. [...] Payouts are capped at $20 million per individual. Oh well, I guess everyone's got to face the new economic reality.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I was very motivated to read the 8-K, in a pissed-off sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312508201369/d8k.htm"&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Item 5.02 Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Compensation Committee of the Microsoft Corporation (“Company”) Board of Directors has approved a new executive officer incentive plan (“Plan”) for the Company’s executive officers. The Plan replaces the existing annual cash bonus and equity award programs for the Company’s executive officers beginning with fiscal year 2009. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Plan allows the Compensation Committee to establish award programs for specified performance periods (e.g., one or more fiscal years). The maximum amount payable to a participating executive officer is a percentage of an incentive pool for a performance period. For fiscal year 2009, awards will be granted from an incentive pool with maximum funding of 0.35% of Microsoft’s fiscal year 2009 corporate operating income. The awards granted to each participating executive officer will be limited to a fixed share of the incentive pool, and these awards may be further reduced or eliminated in the discretion of the Compensation Committee (or in the discretion of the Board of directors, for awards to the Company’s chief executive officer, Steven A. Ballmer). The Plan specifies a maximum amount of $20,000,000 that may be paid under the Plan to a participating executive officer for one or more performance periods that end during a fiscal year. Award amounts under the Plan may be made in either or both stock awards issued under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan and cash. Vesting of stock awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee. The 2001 Stock Plan generally requires that stock awards vest over at least a three-year period. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I could shove my pockets full of cash would I flip off shareholders and employees worried about the stock price, too? No, not even I could do that, for (&lt;i&gt;like this&lt;/i&gt;) all the money on the world. I guess the &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=MSFT"&gt;insider-trading&lt;/a&gt; gravy train must have started running out of steam and goodness knows we don't want our executive leadership looking for employment elsewhere, so what else could we do to retain them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the feckless vote of confidence that a bunch of screw-ups like Yahoo! got at their recent shareholder's meeting, I don't have much confidence in our shareholders challenging our leadership. Stock price? Don't care, got mine. What kind of performance targets must the company reach to achieve the rewards? Not gonna tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First SPSA. Now this. Microsoft is dying from the inside, and the folks sucking it dry have zero motivation to change things. It's working out pretty damn well for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft shareholders say? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Crickets chirping&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/msft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/msft"&gt;MSFT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/1105063783646655309/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=1105063783646655309' title='201 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/1105063783646655309'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/1105063783646655309'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/09/compensatory-arrangements-of-certain.html' title='Compensatory Arrangements of Certain (Microsoft) Officers'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>201</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-8359817561843515489</id><published>2008-09-17T23:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-22T08:06:52.030-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Microsoft Company Meeting 2008</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alright, here we go!&lt;/b&gt; Company Meeting 2008! A chance to forget everything that went wrong last year? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of yesteryear, I've touched on The Company Meeting in &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2004/08/microsoft-company-meeting-2004.html"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/09/microsoft-company-meeting-2005.html"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2006/09/microsoft-company-meeting-2006.html"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2007/09/microsoft-company-meeting-2007.html"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. 2004 was fairly light because that was the special limited seating event that let everyone forget that it was actually the Company Meeting day and go-about their day as usual. 2005 was fun. 2006 was weird with the coordinated post-commenting frenzy here. And 2007 started with great potential and melted down with each mind-numbing demo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus the burping game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main wish this year is that Ballmer's speech meets last year's quality, that he shows last year scorecard and where we are now, and that more than 1,000 people are around to hear the speech when it actually happens. Let's hear more about the idea of Many Microsofts. Or... was last year all throw away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I'm off to pack some warm clothes and a few extra cups for all of the Microsoft Kool-aid I intend to guzzle. Sorry, all you folks who think it's a waste of money and effort. This is my opportunity to re-energize myself and see my peers and team re-energized. Oh, and do me a favor on Thursday: join me in letting out a joyful "&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Boo!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" for any hiring statistics that show us throwing on more and more bodies we don't need in the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post Company Meeting &lt;/b&gt;- some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it's days later but I still have that tangy fresh taste of Microsoft Kool-aid running around my mouth. I felt that the Company Meeting was really enjoyable. I appreciate it took a tremendous amount of effort into coordinating it and making amends for last year. Rainn Wilson I thought was a great host and, c'mon, who couldn't have loved his big finale before SteveB's entrance?!? A band, shooting flames, fireworks, exploding streamers, break dancers, and beach balls tumbling down on the crowd! Whoo! Why did it have to end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And kudos to the planners for an innovative solution to the constant paper airplane harassment of year's past. I don't know if we broke a world record or not. Hopefully not. Hopefully every year we just miss it &lt;i&gt;by that much&lt;/i&gt; and we try again the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the crowd held together. I always look around and see how people are doing and keep an ear out for distracted chatter. The crowd pretty much was engaged most of the time, except for Craig Mundie. It was a big crowd and everyone stayed put until the end, vs. the large-scale abandonment we had last year up to and through Mr. Ballmer's presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Random notes from me&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was nice that it started off with a big-reveal. Will Halo-fanboys be upset to know that Master Chief's face was revealed only to Microsofties? Keep the secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/techtracks/2008/09/08/microsofts_new_vision_a_little_wordier_than_the_ol.html"&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Create experiences that combine the magic of software with the power of Internet services across a world of devices&lt;/span&gt;." Ba-roo? Everytime I think of it, all I see is a grinning &lt;a href="http://doughenning.com/"&gt;Doug Henning&lt;/a&gt; tossing a handful of confetti sparkles into the air, gasping, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;...the &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;software&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;" and conjuring up a glittering world full of devices. Mr. Adam Barr &lt;a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2008/09/vision_statemen.html"&gt;works over the mission statement &lt;/a&gt;and comes up with something far more direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demos&lt;/b&gt;: better than last year, if that's saying anything. There was a lot of stable-candy that could have been shown but that wasn't. I'm glad they went through Office 14 and Windows 7 scenarios, along with some of our other apps out there. The geek in me was indeed wow'd by the Excel demo and I felt proud that we had implemented something as geekily-groovy as that. I want to meet the people who did this and listen to their story of how it actually all works. I think I would learn something great. I can't say that the customer reaction will be as enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm disappointed that the teams that could have shown something really rah-rah cool didn't. I'm looking at you, Xbox. Oh, wait, there was the whole bust-a-move part... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&lt;/b&gt;: over and over again it was pointed out that Microsoft employees are its biggest assets. And? I guess admission is the first step. I'm not looking for bread and circuses perks like dry cleaning and grocery drop-off but rather deep meaningful career development and a meritocracy in our compensation for people and teams. And, you know, having less assets around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speakers&lt;/b&gt;: better than last year, and no random Slick Willies from the country club. Yeah! Elop is a really good presenter. Ray was okay, as was most everyone. Sinofsky was a bit bumpy in getting the words out (&lt;i&gt;he makes up for it in typing, trust me&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/craig/"&gt;Craig Mundie&lt;/a&gt; was a wall: a cold-stop wall that everyone used as a mental- and bio-break. Most folks in my section were asking, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Hey, who is this guy?&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there was Steve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's SteveB speech was much better and deeper and challenging. This year: not bad and not challenging at all. Yes, we had the five points to go over so I guess that replaces the scorecard from last year (&lt;i&gt;too bad... what's the worth of having a scorecard if you're not keeping score?&lt;/i&gt;). No mention of the becoming many Microsofts. But, we have a discussion of The Stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft Stock&lt;/b&gt;: (&lt;i&gt;SteveB slowly waves his a hand infront of the audience&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;b&gt;These are not the droids you're looking for. You don't care about the Microsoft stock price. Move along. Move along. &lt;/b&gt;I'd like to say "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Nice try.&lt;/span&gt;" But it wasn't even that. Does anyone remember that brief moment of Microsoft stock flirting around $37? I don't know about you, but I started to see a new old-energy kick on around my team and the teams I worked with. Last year, Mr. Ballmer asked what had happened to our boldness. I know where it is, and it starts at around $37. You want to see super-boldness? That starts at $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it also starts in NOT doing dumb knee-capping moves like the muddled acquisition attempt of Yahoo! The responsibility for causing that stock plunge and its aftermath was not even mentioned. Un-bold. Yahoo! was totally that terribly embarrassing family event - like a wedding that melted down at the altar - that no one brought up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of us have been at this company - and participating in the stock compensation program - already for the long-term. And have stock bupkis, along with our shareholders. So it was bold to bring up the stock issue, but the discussion was unsatisfying and lacked any sort of boldness explaining mistakes that have got us here (&lt;i&gt;Yahoo!, surprising Wall Street with multi-billion dollar investments, etc&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least we know a bargain when we see it: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/sep08/09-22dividend.mspx"&gt;Microsoft Announces Share Repurchase Program and Increases Quarterly Dividend $40 billion authorized for share repurchase; Dividend increased 18 percent&lt;/a&gt;. That's good, and lord help us all if that doesn't put the final nail into the Yahoo! acquisition coffin. A curious development as part of this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Microsoft also announced that its board of directors has authorized debt financings from time to time of up to $6 billion. Pursuant to the authorization, the company has established a $2 billion commercial paper program. Microsoft intends to use the net proceeds from any debt financings for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital and repurchases of stock. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious to me given that Microsoft and Debt have never been two words I've put together in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Say&lt;/b&gt;: after the meeting, what are your impressions? You know, safe to share impressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/8359817561843515489/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=8359817561843515489' title='166 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/8359817561843515489'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/8359817561843515489'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/09/microsoft-company-meeting-2008.html' title='Microsoft Company Meeting 2008'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>166</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-2162998256519836297</id><published>2008-09-03T21:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-03T21:48:26.274-07:00</updated><title type='text'>(tap tap tap) Is This Thing On?</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;tap tap tap... is this thing on?&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review Season&lt;/b&gt;: well, just about everyone should have their reviews and numbers by now or very very soon - at least by the time you get your next automatic deposit! Given that address book updates went out the beginning of this week (&lt;i&gt;for titles that are no longer opaque thanks to the CSPs&lt;/i&gt;) I've barged into more than one conversation of "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;Can you believe that &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;fill in the blank&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; was promoted to- oh! Hi.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, while I still deeply appreciate not having to fork over sacrificial 3.0 reviews, I am still seeing, for all of my organization, okay compensation numbers for great work. And freaking-fantastic numbers for super-star work (&lt;i&gt;salary schmalary for those people&lt;/i&gt;). That is how our system is set up and for those individual super-stars, it works out very very well. But by necessity, it requires great workers to get okay compensation in order to put the super in super-rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if it makes you angry, put that energy into networking around Microsoft for a new position or spiffing up that resume and seeing what other opportunities there are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Company Meeting ahoy&lt;/b&gt;: not too long until the 2008 Microsoft Company Meeting. For any new readers: I absolutely love the Company Meeting, though &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2007/09/microsoft-company-meeting-2007.html"&gt;last year's Company Meeting certainly tried my patience&lt;/a&gt;... like that Sweetheart that starts being a a real dick to make you break up with them. Things on my wish list for this year's Meeting, kind of echoing that old post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Very few demos&lt;/i&gt;: at least, any demos there are should be short, fast, new vs. repackaged, and presented as if you were doing a power demo to the smartest people in the world. Cos you sorta are. And goodness, no calls for helps if your demo goes belly up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ballmer early&lt;/i&gt;: Ballmer gave a fantastic and interesting speech last year. Which most people didn't hear because their endurance gave out long before. I'd still expect him to be the end-of-day blood-rushing presenter. But I hope he can show up early to either kick things off or serve as a punch to keep things going.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shaking Money Makers&lt;/i&gt;: time to show off Win7 and Office 14. Well, if you're like me you get to see them a lot everyday, but there needs to be a highly condensed so fast you miss half of what you see demo spurt of Win7 and O14, along with teasers of other emerging properties. They are our financial foundation and while most of the development work is done for them and we have at least a year before they surf through DCRs and stabilization, the employees deserve a peep show here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Blood&lt;/i&gt;: thanks to our great Town Halls, I kinda don't need to hear from our executive leadership team. I'd like to see some new, up-and-coming blood on stage vs. the same-old-same-old. And please, we're geeks, so make sure the new blood is geek-o-riffic like the rest of us vs. those country club shiny people that popped up so much last year. &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Shudder&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; How about some &lt;a href="http://www.microspotting.com/"&gt;Microspotting&lt;/a&gt; interludes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surprises&lt;/i&gt;: we come to this to be surprised and see things before (&lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt;) anyone else. Get CliffyB on stage to demo Gears of Wars 2 or something. Show us the new Halo stuff. The new 120GB Zune and interesting new Zune software features. Something. I won't blog about it. Cross my heart. Just please don't make the Xbox or Zune seem as lame and empty as they did last year. Here's Apple popping out another special event soon. Pop 'em back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Seinfield Reconciliation Paradox&lt;/i&gt;: or, time to show us the new ad campaign and how we have a coherent brand strategy that makes sense. There are a lot of fronts of our business with aggressive competitors that we're slipping in (&lt;i&gt;mobile, gaming, television, OS, browsing, consumer&lt;/i&gt;). Time to see that not only do we realize this, we have a plan to meet and exceed. And goodness help you if your advertising solution to this involves some guy stuck in a big vat of orange goo in a barren landscape bragging how he can still check his Outlook email on his Windows Mobile Device. What?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Logistics&lt;/i&gt;: man, be on the first bus out of Redmond if you want to enjoy the Company Meeting. I usually leave as soon as I can but I'm still there after things have started. And I feel bad being into the third or fourth presentation and seeing a line of charter buses still making their way to Safeco Field. I do hope our buses figure different routes to get to the same point. And non-Microsofties: stay the heck away from Safeco field on 9/18/08.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Paper&lt;/i&gt;: how about you sit down on the floor / first level and get pelted with poorly made paper airplanes for the whole meeting? That should be your penalty if you are involved in the least in distributing any paper to the Microsofties as they come in to Safeco.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I right in that they've dropped the whole best manager competition? Hmm. Guess after that one winner we exhausted all the candidates. What do you want to see at the Company Meeting or have the leadership talk about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Old Business&lt;/b&gt;: it has been a while. The next thing I planned to write about was the Word from Wall Street with Charles Di Bona and Dylan Yolles from back near the end of July. Colleen, you crack me up, asking if Mr. DiBona was Mini-Microsoft. I wish! And Charlie, you could never disappoint me. Dividends. Buy back. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one interesting impression I got out of the vibe from the analysts: Microsoft leadership, time is up. Time is up to have us trust that you have a super secret plan that will really, truly work any year now. You went and convinced us that you have a huge vulnerability with respect to the online world by that totally confused and befuddled attempt to acquire Yahoo! and now you give us no specifics about what you're doing. Other than spending a whole hell of a lot of money (&lt;i&gt;nice: You're telling us that there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Only, that rainbow is going to cost a lot of money to build to get us to that pot&lt;/i&gt;). Time's up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with Mr. Yolles about the consumer market.vs. the enterprise market. If anything, we've suffered in doing so much for the enterprise market that most of the features are either user hostile (&lt;i&gt;look, I can shut you out of using a USB drive&lt;/i&gt;) or just non-interesting. I think you can have both. There's a bunch of money walking around in the pockets of everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for our huge cash reserve: now that we're not buying Yahoo! (&lt;i&gt;right, right?&lt;/i&gt;) what to do? Not a dividend! But a big buyback of our stock. There was a rumor a couple of weeks ago that a buyback was under consideration, but nothing's come of it since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting observation was made that Google's Android has been created with 30 people at Google. That makes analysts look at how many people are responsible for Windows Mobile and ask, "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;Why? Why so many people? Why so much overhead? How do the results match up?&lt;/span&gt;" This feeds a desire now for some picking around in our overhead of our groups. Not a place our leadership wants to be, but a hard question that goes unanswered: what the hell do you need all these people for, anyway? Can you get by with less? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Of course we can. If you had to lose 10% of your group, not only would you get by, you'd receive a new sort of clarity about what was truly important vs. distracting. Our over abundance of people allows us to overwhelm our work with marginal, half-thought-out features to keep the mediocre C contributors busy and lets us go into the weeds pursuing edge cases. Ah, well, tired of listening to this same broken record?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final take-away: Microsoft has to demonstrate that it is efficient and effective. What does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Administrivia&lt;/i&gt;: apologies for being away for an extended duration. It was a necessary departure and absence to be elsewhere with a situation that required my full attention. Best wishes to you to avoid such experiences for a long, long time. I'm about to go through... fifty pending comments. Whew. Where's that wine bottle?

There was Mr. Johnson up on stage this morning during the Town Hall causing me to roll my eyes with his fake enthusiasm and now he's leaving Dodge. On the horse he rode in on 16 years back. I know he did a lot to pick up the pieces after the Vista-debacle and is probably due a good amount of praise for letting Win7 align itself to be on the winning trajectory, but I just never bonded with Mr. Johnson's leadership. And some of the projects he's interested in and driving just leave me cold (&lt;i&gt;e.g., the upcoming MSN UI revamp. It puts the F in WTF&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is he taking the opportunity to be CEO of Juniper? Is he the fall guy for Yahoo! being such a bumbling mess? Is his departure meant to make way for a big acquisition / merger?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we consider the long race to succeed Ballmer, I was certainly worried that Mr. Johnson was at the top of the stack rank. No reason to worry anymore! And three of my favorite technical leaders, Mr. Sinofsky, Mr. DeVaan, and Mr. Veghte, all move up a notch. Hey, one less layer in the company. Throw all three of them in the running, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this had only happened before Ms. Foley's chat in Redmond about Microsoft's future: &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/144174.asp"&gt;Audio Mary Jo Foley on 'Microsoft 2.0'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's one hell of a way to kick off our Financial Analysts Meeting (&lt;i&gt;psst, here's a hint: surprises? Analysts no like&lt;/i&gt;). Any interesting takes on the departure, and the future hire that's TBD? First comment I've seen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wow, I just heard that Kevin Johnson resigned. So much for trying to rid the product group of the cancer left by Allchin!

It will be interesting to see the write-ups today, given that Google is announcing their quarterly results today, too, so some compare and contrast might arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Yahoo! foolishness going on the Online business will get extra scrutiny on the call, along with any sort of probing around the edges concerning Yahoo! plans and how it affects Live Search scale-out. Next week is the Microsoft Financial Analysts Meeting on campus, followed by a Friday morning "Word from Wall Street" meeting that I highly recommend (&lt;i&gt;prediction: for at least the 3rd year running, Mr. Charles Di Bona will insist that Microsoft increases its dividend to something of significance to make up for the total lack of stock performance&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in a good mood, avoid looking at the &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MSFT&amp;amp;t=1y&amp;amp;l=on&amp;amp;z=m&amp;amp;q=l&amp;amp;c="&gt;one-year chart for the MSFT stock&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, we did hit up in the $37 range. Yes, just a short time ago, we dead cat bounced onto $25. Mr. Ballmer insists he doesn't pay attention to the Microsoft stock price, but all this hammering on Yahoo!, and the dissatisfaction around Yahoo! stock price we're leveraging, has to come back to stick on Ballmer one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Welch got the nickname &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch"&gt;Neutron Jack&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Ballmer's gonna be due a financial nickname soon, whether due to his Ahab pursuit over Yahoo! or finally investors giving up on his inability to &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008023295_ballmerqastox29.html"&gt;channel solid profits into a worthy stock price&lt;/a&gt; but rather kneecapping the stock quite often. Flatline Steve? Ballmer the Embalmer? I think I need some Wall Street wit to help out here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Later, after the announcement&lt;/b&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, our stock is kneecapped, this time it would appear thanks to the ongoing Yahoo! foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/microsoft_q4_2008_by_the_numbers.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535"&gt;Microsoft Watch - Corporate - Microsoft Q4 2008 by the Numbers&lt;/a&gt; by Mr. Joe Wilcox. As always, if you only read one write-up, read Joe's. Nice take on the conference call, too. Snippet, with my disgruntled bolding: "While Microsoft posted strong year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings, earnings per share came in at the low end of guidance. During a conference call this afternoon, Microsoft CFO Chris Liddell expressed disappointment about earnings per share, which he partly attributed to weak economic conditions &lt;b&gt;and uncertainty about the failed Yahoo acquisition.&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/143769.asp?source=rss"&gt;Microsoft profits miss Wall Street estimates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/07/17/microsoft-s-online-services-business-posts-0-5bn-loss-in-q4-2008.aspx"&gt;Microsoft’s Online Services Business posts $0.5bn loss in Q4 2008 - LiveSide - News blog&lt;/a&gt; by Chris over at LiveSide.net. Okay, let's not judge our losses by Xbox multiples: "...posting a $0.5bn loss in one quarter is bad, no matter how you try to paint it, and makes the need for acquiring Yahoo look all the more greater. Admittedly its still not as bad as the $1.2bn loss posted by E&amp;amp;D, the Xbox and Zune division, in Q4 2007 - the entire OSB loss for 2008 is only $1.3bn."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/brierdudley/2008/07/amazing_tidbits_in_microsofts.html"&gt;Brier Dudley's blog Microsoft earnings tidbits Danger costs, plus MSFT's mortgage issue Seattle Times Newspaper Blog&lt;/a&gt; - Brier digs around some of the R&amp;amp;D cost ramping up in Zune land.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't too happy with the Shinola that has crept into the reading of our numbers. I like enthusiasm, but even I was a bit put-off. I also didn't like how useless most of Mr. Liddell's answers were on the conference call. Of course, folks were trying to ask oh-so-hard questions like "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;When will Online Services turn a profit?&lt;/span&gt;" Not 2009. 2010? If you were to pull the plug on MSN and Spaces tomorrow, who would notice? Or, should I say, who would not be able to find a similar (&lt;i&gt;perhaps even profit-making&lt;/i&gt;) service to immediately start using? Inconvenient? &lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt;. Essential? &lt;b&gt;No&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/msft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/msft"&gt;MSFT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/8345124351038692994/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=8345124351038692994' title='82 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/8345124351038692994'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/8345124351038692994'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/07/microsoft-fy08q4-results.html' title='Microsoft FY08Q4 Results'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>82</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-7502888568324169580</id><published>2008-07-14T21:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-14T21:46:58.958-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The Tumbling Tumbleweeds of Summer</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Rocking back and forth in the rocking chair after a nice fine sunny NW day - pity they have WiFi in so many places nowadays...&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, hi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like it's going to be tumbling tumbleweeds here for a while, at least until the weather turns rainy again (&lt;i&gt;bizarre pre-4th thunderstorms excluded&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a sign of resignation here, I'm far more interested in enjoying some concerts and great hiking than sharing any perspectives about my take on Microsoft. I look back &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2004/07/blast-off-for-mini-microsoft.html"&gt;four years ago from when I started sharing my conversation&lt;/a&gt;, and it's sort of a wash. Yes, we've had some flattening that Jack Welch even might grunt a tacit approval to. Internet Explorer reformed. There was a revamping of the 4.0/3.5/3.0 scale. Towels. But JHC, we continue to balloon and expand with no rhyme and reason, and cutting back in employee size is the tune I came here to sing. So, enjoying a breeze off of Puget Sound is a lot more pleasurable than thinking about our constricting bloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First thing: for those in Redmond / Seattle who read this post right while it's fresh, Ms. Mary Jo Foley, author of the book Microsoft 2.0, will be in Redmond to discuss all things Redmond on July 22nd: &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1482"&gt;Bringing Microsoft 2.0 to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. 6pm. Malt &amp;amp; Vine. 16851 Redmond Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BillG put in his goodbye since my last post. Pick up &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft2.net/"&gt;Ms. Foley's book&lt;/a&gt; and read the Mini-Microsoft foreword for some of my feelings around that. Look, BillG is not replaceable. No one is going to take his place at Microsoft. I mostly enjoyed his goodbye presentation, though I had to shake my head when Ballmer reflected that Bill's greatest parting gift to us was the culture of Microsoft. No, that's messy. You can impart a culture and expect it to continue in your daily absence. Bill's culture fades day to day, unless the emerging leadership truly pushes forward with it as their own. But can they even live up to him? No. Time for a new culture, one that makes sense for our current challenges and that shows the level of quality of our leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a small example of culture: I'm back to reading some business books. It's pretty sad that I have to read Jack Welch to get an understanding of the basis of our differentiated rewards review system, vitality curve and all. I may not agree with it, but at least Mr. Welch takes time to explain its application, end-to-end, to the huge organization that GE is. Which is more than Microsoft leadership does. We just sort of assimilated it, bolted it on, and said "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;it is what it is.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BillG heads out, Ballmer's in the middle of leading this classic Pacific Northwest passive aggressive can't make a clear decision to save our lives play for Yahoo! Well, as of today, less passive, &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/jul08/07-14statement.mspx"&gt;more agressive&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like we are Yahoo!'s creepy and inappropriate neighbor, peeking through the slates in the fence, asking for a date whenever given a chance. And, oooo!, the Yahoo!s have a new boarder moving in, Carl! Carl's not exactly our friend, but he will invite us over to hang. We're gonna get a date with that cute Yahoo! chick yet! She has an &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt; car we've been dying to drive around town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Yahoo! we stumbled over our own feet and had to put away the hostile takeover knife we pulled, and in the immediate aftermath was folks wondering: "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;Gee, this Ballmer guys needs to be replaced. But with who? There's no obvious replacement. Dude. Looks like Microsoft better just keep him.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's scary in two ways: one, the lack of confidence and respect the community has for Mr. Ballmer's leadership and results (&lt;i&gt;though, a large part of this is riding on Kevin Johnson's shoulders&lt;/i&gt;). Then, two: not to wish bad things, but if Mr. Ballmer was run over by a truck (&lt;i&gt;American made, thank you&lt;/i&gt;): then what? Who'd take his place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short order, Mr. Ballmer has to start a race, running from President down to Corporate VP, to identify his successor. My money was always riding on Jeff Raikes, but BillG has Mr. Raikes now. I'm concerned about who Mr. Ballmer and the board would choose. Some golf-club flim-flam smooth-talker, someone who thinks another Microsoft-branded web browser would be a swell idea? Someone who has never written a piece of software in their lives, let alone shipped and supported it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, not to run Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I'll spend some time lingering over the VP biographies (&lt;i&gt;trying not to &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/gounares/default.mspx"&gt;sigh and swoon&lt;/a&gt; [remember: inappropriate]&lt;/i&gt;). Who would you follow? Who do you respect? I don't care if you hate their guts, who would you want to step up and lead Microsoft in the years ahead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the challenge of discovering a worthy CEO.next, I hope this year's Company Meeting returns and builds out the theme of Many Microsofts. I'm a fool for thinking of one leader to run it all, perhaps. But we need some obvious folks to step up. Cos we're not there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/7502888568324169580/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=7502888568324169580' title='69 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/7502888568324169580'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/7502888568324169580'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/07/tumbling-tumbleweeds-of-summer.html' title='The Tumbling Tumbleweeds of Summer'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>69</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-6045898251890181365</id><published>2008-06-18T19:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-18T19:22:09.690-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Oy, an Extreme Bummer!</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Another blogging light has gone out: MSFTextrememakeover has put up one last post, &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/06/eight-years-of-wrongness.html"&gt;Eight Years of Wrongness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that's how to go out in style! So take a moment to grab your favorite drink and put some time aside and give it one, long slow read. The kick-off:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's sobering to realize that during Ballmer's term as CEO, MSFT has underperformed almost all of its top tech peers (including AAPL, IBM, HPQ, SAP, INTC, CSCO, SYMC, NOK, ORCL, ADBE, RIMM, QCOM, Ebay, and AMZN), and badly lagged the major averages. We may even see our third plunge to test the 2000 lows during his watch. Unbelievable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...wait for it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So it's time for me to listen to the fat lady who has been singing for years now, and finally pull the plug. I can't keep waiting another 11 years for MSFT's leadership to deliver the returns that say AAPL's have in just the past 12 months, despite struggling (and that's on top of 2000+% this decade). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...leading to the send-off:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So with that, I announce the end of my MSFTextrememakeover blogging career. The timing seems right as this is my 100th post. Good luck to all those who continue to hold MSFT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn. Well, all good things, right? I'll certainly miss the analysis that went beyond anything I ever pulled together. Cheers to you, Extreme, and thanks for the posts.

The wonderful Mini-Laptop, my bud the four years of Mini-Microsoft writing and planning, has given up what I think is its last ghost. It's my isolated, centralized hub of posting and comment approval, and while I weigh repair vs. replacement, things are going to have to go dark here for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is fine. I think a number of folks didn't much care for the three fingered &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/05/whats-up-with-microsoft-india.html"&gt;nature of the comments in the last post&lt;/a&gt;. While there was some discussion of how to fix the problems, it got overwhelmed by grinded axes swinging wildly against certain personalities in Microsoft India leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I take a hardware induced break here, I'll be thinking about future topics. Please take a moment to consider what sounds like good, interesting paths of productive discussion. Drop me a line, if you like. Sorry if it takes a bit to respond. I thought about opening up comments while I'm cut-off (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;sorry, I'm just not comfortable lurking in the library on public computers to approve comments&lt;/span&gt;), but decided that without engaging news open comments just lead to noise and comment spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I'm off to light a candle for the Mini-Laptop.

But I've gone through about two months worth of comments on a theme that emerged on its own and kept going and going, post to post, even amidst all the Yahoo!-acquisition foolishness. I promised a follow-up post on the specific topic - here you go. I find great irony that while these comments were brewing here, InsideMS wrote up an internal story: "Is Hyderabad the New Redmond?" Hmmmmm.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, in a blog post weeks ago, a commenter made the following small post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How bad is things in Microsoft India? The GM Neelam Dhawan is fired and going back to HP. She is taking Rajiv Srivastava with her. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this was first met with an anti-India "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;why should I care&lt;/span&gt;" comment response that grew a thread about racial-preference and other grudges folks hold towards their Indian peers. Which in turn was countered with enthusiastic backlash-backlash, and grumbles about racism. In the meantime, comment after comment started a far more interesting series of insight that spanned all the recent posts that came up during our ill-conceived stock-busting Yahoo! gambit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since there is no India blog for Microsoft I am forced to write here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My friends and fellow Microsoft people, let me tell you that the situation in SMSG India is horrible. People are leaving and the leadership never meets the employees. We have box manufacturers trying to sell software. We have Chairman who I have not seen in 6 months in person. I have seen him on TV and the newspaper a few times. We have MD Neelam Dhawan who interviewed at Cisco 2 times and did not get a job there and is now going back to HP. The Country Manager for Xbox has left. BMO has almost 100% churn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We now spend so much time reporting and having conference calls that I cannot meet my customer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does the Redmond people care about what is happening in MS India? Who can I complain to if I have a problem? Will Kevin Turner and Jean Philipe Courtois have an all hands meeting with the staff but without the India management present? You know we cannot speak the truth with our management because we will lose our jobs. And I want to keep my job till I get another offer. Like all the employees around me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;..and...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;India Dev Center (IDC) is a pure empire building exercise. It is all about creating more partners as the VP mentioned in his Redmond recruitment visits. It is a good tour for a few Redmond folks who find a "sugar daddy", go to India for 2-3 years, get two promotions and come back to a different job in Redmond.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meanwhile, a few exceptions aside, the quality of the work is abysmal. Components that came back to Redmond had to be completely rewritten.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe not:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I work for WinSE in IDC (India Development Center). The situation is much better there. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We work in tandem with our counter parts in Redmond/China and have been making on-time and good-quality deliverables. The GDRs/Hotfixes/Service Packs which get shipped periodically are a result of good team work between the three huge teams. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;However, our org, does not report to the India DC VP (we report to the Redmond VP), which probably is why we have a better coordination with the Redmond and ATC teams.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tick for your tock, perhaps pointing an organizational leadership problem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[...] the so called innovative ideas emerging out of IDC are so stale that they just don't get qualified to be called as innovative product ideas. The VP heading IDC is under tremendous pressure to show that there is some great innovation happening here. But, unfortunately his team is just not capable of delivering anything that will be worth talking about.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;IDC is still not capable of standing on its feet. It is completely remote controlled by Redmond. The teams here are just puppets that play into the whims of the Redmond GMs. The senior dev/test managers here lack depth and confidence to deliver independently.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, engagement started to happen within the Mini-Microsoft comment stream. A comment signed by Sudeep Bharati engages discussion around mobile app development at IDC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are few comments &amp;amp; assertions that have been made in this thread about “Mobile Developer” team at IDC. As the PUM for this org, I would like to make sure that the readers have the perspective from the other side too. IDC team has owned the Visual Studio for Devices charter for around 2 years now and has delivered a full release of this product with VS 2008. In this release, we added significant value to the product enabling test driven development for device projects with unit testing, programmable security configuration, managed API model to access and manipulate devices from the desktop as well as numerous enhancements to device emulator. Each one of these features are high value components for mobile developers and have been widely appreciated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following up on that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We mastered the art of writing specs, converting that to code and testing it. But where is the innovation?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is a serious lack of thought leadership in this group. Show me one senior member of the team who understands the big picture of the mobile developer story. We now have a lot of responsibility to deliver the complete platform and I do not see the maturity to do that. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our focus is too narrow and we wear the colored glasses that only show us what we want to see! The mobile innovation is happening else where. Is there someone in the team who can confidently articulate what the competition is up to? Do we know anything about J2ME Midlet story? Do we know how Symbian stacks against us? Are we clear about Adobe's Flash story on mobile? Do we have a strategy for mobile web authoring? How do we counter the iPhone SDK? What will Google do with Android? What will IBM do with Eclipse in this space?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No! We have no time to figure this out.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comment signed by David D'Souza responds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mobile Developer Group intends to make products customers will love. We know the mobile field is broad and difficult. The strategies of the past won’t work again; as they say, people have seen that movie. Dynamics change and competitors are just as likely partners of the future - Windows Mobile includes Adobe Flash and Silverlight is porting to Nokia. [...]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a partner at Microsoft, I’m engaged and passionate about the mobility area and equally passionate about ensuring IDC is a great place to work. If you are inside MSFT, you can browse my/site and watch our IDC Mobility Days presentations. As much as Windows 3 changed the PC experience, we need to achieve similar transformations in the mobile experience. We have breadth for multiple partner level people in this organization and we’re continually growing and enhancing our engineering capacity to deal with the challenges we face. Our products will be second to none. We will have fun, innovate, and work in new ways.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A demonstration of the As hiring Bs that end up with Cs and Ds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The other huge concern is about quality of hires at IDC. I see pathetic hires walking into the product teams. The PUM/GM put a lot of pressure on HR and they end up fast tracking the hiring process. On top of that, you always have internal poaching which is very unhealthy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...additionally...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;While quality of hiring at Microsoft India IDC may be bad, the new hires in MS SMSG India is even worse. The interview process does not even exist, exit interviews dont exist, people get into jobs that are way above their abilities or interest and we have Neelam Dhawan to inspire people to join Microsoft.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On leadership:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have been with EPG at MS India (SMSG) for a long time. I have seen the ups and downs and saw many leaders come and go. But, let me tell you that the current HP imports are horrible leaders to work with. Someone said it right - They raped the Microsoft culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My request to the CVP is to spend more time with the employees and hear their version. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...and leadership choosing the wrong carrot:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everything is wrong at Microsoft India. There is now a reward of some cheap notebook if we get to the revenue target. Does Neelam (GM) not realise that we work for pride and challenge and whether or not she offers us a Rs,13000 HCL notebook we will do our best. I am insulted by this offer of a gift if the subsidiary meets the revenue goal. Last year, everyone got xbox and Neelam thought that people worked harder for the chance at winning xbox. Her cheap thinking about what motivates people at Microsoft is one of the reasons we are suffering in India today. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Go back to HP Neelam. You have no idea about Microsoft culture and how to motivate people.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the gloves slip off:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[T]he underlying fact is that 70% of MS India is stinking with corrupt leaders. EPG has no moral values and ethics in selling. No one even understands why DPE should be paid in the first place. Public Sector has a new country lead for every 12 months and no one has a clue on handling the government accounts. HR is non existent and has the maximum attrition than any group. PR is busy bribing the media and publications to print positive stories. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The DPE lead is great at dancing at internal events and no one knows what else he is good at. Even if everyone in DPE are fired right away, it wouldn't make any difference to us. It's a well known fact that they will be the first to go out if there is a lay off at MS. This team is more of a liability than an asset. The earlier we fire them, the better for us. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outside perspective starts with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, let me share my view from outside. MS India has completely forgotten the community initiative. They are too busy impressing their hierarchy. There were times when the MVP/RD community was really valued and we were respected for what we are! Things are very different now. The MVP lead is in a deep slumber and does nothing for the community. I haven't met anyone from DPE India for ages. We only hear sugar coated statements from the GMs or senior executives when we bump into them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending out an S O S:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An open letter to Mr. Jean-Philippe Courtois &amp;amp; Mr. Kevin Turner -&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you please visit India once and listen to the feedback from the field?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The CVP, MD and all her direct reports made this company a miserable place to work for! They created a feudal fiefdom for themselves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please don't fall for things like the 'Best Place to Work For' recognition by a reputed publication. These can be bought in India for a price. It is a well known fact that the One India PR head spent a fraction of her budget to buy this! It's an irony that we got that award when we are experiencing the opposite of that - 'worst place to work for!'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You might be rewriting the corporate history and also doing something like this for the first time at Microsoft- Can you please fire the CVP and everyone who is two levels below him? Only that can save the Indian subsidiary.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't let the door knob hit you where the dog should have bit you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With 4 key departures in SMSG in Microsoft India in the past 2 days, it looks like the attrition rate is worse than that of a call center. The only problem is that the CVP and the country GM are not leaving. Ravi is in denial that he is singularly responsible for the fuck up that is called Microsoft India SMSG. And Neelam is unable to find a job anywhere else.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrapping back to the very first comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Breaking News From MS India - The MD, Neelam Dhawan has put up her papers and will be leaving anytime now! Few of her direct reports would be following her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So, Good things started to happen for Microsoft India. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...plus...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The really breaking news from Microsoft India is that the MD has been fired for the same transaction that various Microsoft people in Delhi have already been fired. She will not be a Microsoft employee by the time this fiscal year ends. Finally the good news is here. I hope she takes all her HP people with her with the EPG head being the first one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moorthy Uppaluri is also the new DPE head.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini - can you please reopen a seperate thread on Microsoft India SMSG and R&amp;amp;D? There are lots of stories of nepotism, poor OHI, bad quality work and a possible financial impropriety doing the rounds in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, okay. To quote a farm boy, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;As you wish.&lt;/span&gt;" Not... that... you're my Buttercup or anything. But here's an open door and open area to discuss Microsoft India: what the problems are, how to get management to accept that there are problems, where the right place to be is, and how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/4407648657632294472/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=4407648657632294472' title='142 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4407648657632294472'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4407648657632294472'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/05/whats-up-with-microsoft-india.html' title='What&apos;s up with Microsoft India?'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>142</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-4649340002752974203</id><published>2008-05-19T07:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-19T08:03:30.096-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Microsoft + Yahoo! - Desperately in Need of Fat Lady to Sing "It's Over!"</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Oy, what we desperately need here is a Fat Lady to sing the end of the 2008 Microsoft-Yahoo! saga. She's obviously in hiding because over the weekend news came out of Microsoft looking to get a bit of Yahoo!. Or a merger. And the rumor of Microsoft looking to acquire Facebook has started again, all associated with obscene prices that make no sense, except in the obscene-cash-cow Microsoft world where billions of dollars come easily and are blown easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Just a quick "page break" post given the new Yahoo! news&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-18statement.mspx"&gt;Microsoft Issues Statement Regarding Yahoo! Microsoft announced that it is continuing to explore and pursue its alternatives to improve and expand its online services and advertising business.&lt;/a&gt; - the wordsmith genius response for "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;your passion inspires us to create great software to help you reach it&lt;/span&gt;" obviously put this one together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=310948"&gt;Yahoo! Remains Open to Value Maximizing Transactions&lt;/a&gt; - your money inspires us to play hard-to-get to get more of it.

The only benefit (&lt;i&gt;that I can see&lt;/i&gt;) of Microsoft acquiring Facebook is that Microsoft would fix a bunch of crap wrong with the way Facebook is run (&lt;i&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Users? Hate 'em.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;). Scoble on Facebook: "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;This is a scary company and if it gets in the hands of Microsoft will create a scary monopoly.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess this could be a heck of a week, and suddenly Microsoft doesn't look so evil to Yahoo! in comparison to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn"&gt;Icahn&lt;/a&gt;. So freshen up that resume, pop some popcorn, and if you see that Fat Lady, please send her this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/4649340002752974203/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=4649340002752974203' title='178 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4649340002752974203'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4649340002752974203'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/05/microsoft-yahoo-desperately-in-need-of.html' title='Microsoft + Yahoo! - Desperately in Need of Fat Lady to Sing &quot;It&apos;s Over!&quot;'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>178</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-8956623467153416738</id><published>2008-05-03T17:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-03T17:59:38.412-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Microsoft Walks On By - Yahoo!</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well slap my ass and call me Judy!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-03letter.mspx"&gt;Microsoft is walking away from acquiring Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot Damn and Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;I have never, ever been so happy to trash a pending Mini-Microsoft post.

Initial coverage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-03letter.mspx"&gt;Microsoft Withdraws Proposal to Acquire Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;

Savor. Yum.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only not-so-good thing out of not blowing all of our cash at once is that we'll continue to live in an era of cash-cow abundance, preventing us from making profit-minded decisions. The lack of the money cushion would have, I presume, actually caused new projects to expect to bring in cash vs. becoming strategic money pits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of this had best come a new reorganization of our online properties. Out with the old already. We had reached a bet-the-company point in going after Yahoo! to make up for the lack of performance out of MSN / Search / AdCenter in an attempt to leap-frog forward. I think we need to hang-up on the good-enough consensus culture for a while and put in a strategy czar to get things done vs. expecting something to arise out of the dysfunctional ecosystem we currently have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft2.net/"&gt;Microsoft 2.0&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-2-0-Plans-Relevant-Post-Gates/dp/0470191384"&gt;Ms. Mary Jo Foley's book is out now&lt;/a&gt;. Once you get past the foreword, it's a good read. I hope she comes to campus - well, Redmond probably - soon so that folks can have a discussion of the book and ponder the future in a face-to-face forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, we can get back to the usual program of talking about the recent Town Hall and looping back to cover the recent comments about Microsoft India. For now, I'm going to ease back and enjoy this strange feeling I have: being happy regarding a wise decision our leadership finally came around to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/8956623467153416738/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=8956623467153416738' title='350 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/8956623467153416738'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/8956623467153416738'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/05/microsoft-walks-on-by-yahoo.html' title='Microsoft Walks On By - Yahoo!'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>350</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-4932153873649760674</id><published>2008-04-24T07:57:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-24T17:37:08.639-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Microsoft FY08Q3 Results</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FY08Q3: &lt;/b&gt;favorite post-analysis sites for the results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/"&gt;MSFTExtremeMakeover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/index.html"&gt;Mr. Joe Wilcox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/index.asp"&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last report was a knock-out and the stock responded accordingly and shot up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ends up Microsoft leadership had a plan to address that issue: attempt to acquire Yahoo. Amidst a world of puzzled financial faces mumbling "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;wtf?&lt;/span&gt;" we started our ill advised adventure to consume Yahoo, whether they wanted it or not. The stock responded accordingly and tanked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect today will be another solid quarter, but the Ill Advised Adventure Monkey is riding our back and I expect a good bit of the analyst probing will be around Yahoo (&lt;i&gt;wondering if we'd be dumb enough to raise our bid&lt;/i&gt;), and perhaps reviewing the upcoming money-making product stream, plus what a non-Microsoft + Yahoo future looks like (&lt;i&gt;one word: shiny&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ballmer engaged in some good bluster Wednesday, saying that Microsoft could just walk away from the deal. Please, please, &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/04/microsoft-just-walk-on-by.html"&gt;walk on by&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't talked to every employee at Microsoft, of course, but everyone that I've talked to &lt;a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/4/microsoft_employees_want_to_kill_yahoo_deal"&gt;believes this is a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;. And that's not hand wringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall: the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/FY08/earn_rel_q3_08.mspx"&gt;results are in&lt;/a&gt; and... ouch.

A snippet on the initial analysis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Again looking quickly, Client sucked. And it seems to be not just the technology guarantee impact but also anemic OEM growth. The .ppt brags about the same 140M Vista licenses sold that we've been hearing about for a while now. So clearly there's been no acceleration wrt installed base upgrades either. Surprise! Not. MBD was also weak. I haven't delved further to figure out why. Servers put in a strong showing as per usual. Kudos to that group at least. And finally E&amp;amp;D managed to eke out a paper profit (as long as you ignore intra-group transfers and the convenient "Corporate-level activity" bucket).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;b&gt;Mr. Joe Wilcox&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/microsoft_q3_2008_by_the_numbers.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535"&gt;Microsoft Watch - Corporate - Microsoft Q3 2008 by the Numbers&lt;/a&gt; - as always a nice breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;b&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/137390.asp?source=rss"&gt;Microsoft Strategy solid even without Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, which roles up a response from Mr. Liddell that you can only hope allows us to walk on by Yahoo (&lt;i&gt;or at least not raise the offer price&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As outlined in our recent letter to the Yahoo board, unless we make progress with Yahoo towards an agreement by this weekend, we will reconsider our alternatives. We will provide updates as appropriate next week. These alternatives clearly include taking an offer to Yahoo shareholders or to withdraw our proposal and focus on other opportunities, both organic and inorganic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/137377.asp?source=rss"&gt;Notes Microsoft's profits exceed estimates&lt;/a&gt; - snippet regarding Xbox / Entertainment and Devices making money instead of being one huge money sink:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does the operating profit mean that the company is no longer losing money on the Xbox 360 hardware?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Colleen Healy, Microsoft's general manager of investor relations, didn't answer that question directly when I asked this afternoon. However, she said, "What I can confirm for you is we're making really good progress on that cost curve."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;b&gt;WSJ&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/biztech/2008/04/24/vista-drags-on-microsoft/?mod=WSJBlog?mod=yahoo_hs"&gt;Business Technology Vista Drags on Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; - snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If we dig a little deeper there’s evidence to suggest that Microsoft has a Vista problem.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) &lt;b&gt;Scotch it!&lt;/b&gt; Two to close on, including best use of the word "scotch" I've seen in a while:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/080424/microsoft.html?.v=8"&gt;Microsoft results disappoint Financial News - Yahoo!

Why are we out to buy a wilted arrangement? What does Mr. Kevin Johnson - the presumed architect behind the Yahoo acquisition - seem to know that most of the educated financial world doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that we're at least threatening to lower the bid rather than pump it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that this harsh strategic move can also be appreciated as an elegant way to walk on by, noting with disgust Yahoo's ability to deliver and be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blabby McBlabster:&lt;/b&gt; SteveSi, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Pardon me, Mr. Gates, might you step in here for a moment of translucency re-education?&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;b&gt;*Smack*&lt;/b&gt; Somehow the message to not talk about release dates didn't make it up to Bill Gates, &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/135797.asp?source=rss"&gt;all talking about Win7 rolling out next year rather than in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. You know, if that can be pulled off, it would be a lot better to start talking about it once the team has reached the light at the end of the tunnel. Throw this BillG comment in there along with the one of the Sony PS3 release walking head-on into Halo 3 (&lt;i&gt;how'd that go? Oh, yeah, those guys seceded after they succeeded, having released when they were done&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poor Me&lt;/b&gt;: yeah, I miss that DareO has adjusted his priorities and that &lt;a href="http://www.microspotting.com/2008/04/dare-obasanjo"&gt;blogging doesn't fit into them&lt;/a&gt;. I understand, but I'm sad for me and Dare's readers. This blog is indebted to Mr. Obasanjo because without his linkage to the early months Mini-Microsoft there's no way I would have built up that initial high quality readership and participation. Thanks for the links, Dare. One day, when this gig is up, I certainly owe you a lunch out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodness knows &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2006/05/all-good-things.html"&gt;I've thrown in the towel here, too&lt;/a&gt;. And I constantly wonder whether it's worth continuing, given that I'm not putting the deep research and reading into this that I did during those first two years. And the oodles of people we keep hiring is another reason to start fingering the towel: Mini-&lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;? I don't know how many sharks we've jumped here already, and I always see fins in the water ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MSFTExtremeMakeover&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/04/is-sleeping-giant-finally-waking-up-or.html"&gt;Is the Sleeping Giant Finally Waking Up, or Just Rolling Over?&lt;/a&gt; Snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Like Nero fiddling while Rome burned, Ballmer seems to be preoccupied with GOOG while MSFT melts down - or at least while the first embers, which had already been apparent for years, now threaten to turn into something much more serious. Hence the recent ill-advised and fiscally irresponsible YHOO bid. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OO! OO! OOXML!&lt;/b&gt; What's interesting to me is to &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/135682.asp?source=rss"&gt;read the post-reactions to the approval of OOXML&lt;/a&gt; and how many respected people are &lt;a href="http://janvandenbeld.blogspot.com/2008/04/hypocrisy.html"&gt;appalled at the behavior of the anti-OOXML / pro-ODF fanatics&lt;/a&gt;. Now these people get to enjoy the experience of Slashdot-commenter-level idiocy crapping all over them and impugning their reputations. Thanks guys! You just opened a lot of doors to OOXML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least take some solace in: competition is good. Even for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MSPoll 08&lt;/b&gt;: a collection of interesting points made in the &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/03/ms-poll-08.html"&gt;last post about the recent MSPoll 08&lt;/a&gt;: first, around actually implementing change for issues that come up in the poll:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have been manager at Microsoft for several years. In each of the teams that I have been, the management team takes time to interpret the results of the surveys and try to find solutions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;However, it has always been extremely difficult to deal with the huge bureaucracy that have to be addressed in order to make any change (minor or major). [...] We have too much bureaucracy that prevents us from responding quickly, clearly and effectively to our employees and our customers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hope to pass on that the MSPoll can help get 'er done:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last year our PUM was wrecking our group, and the poll results showed it. Our fast-talking PUM convinced his management that this was a result of transient events outside the org, and a few months later we were actually asked to repeat the poll. By this time things were even worse and and the PUM had been publicly taking his frustrations out on his directs, so the 2nd time he really got slaughtered. He lost his team (it went to his GPM) and soon after left MSFT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Viva the poll!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've seen that the poll are almost magical to get rid of your lower performing managers up to GM level. You can't say it doesn't have effect although I don't think it changes any thing beyond that level. I've never heard a VP getting hurt by poll. Certainly won't change Ballmer's mind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One disturbing theme did pop-up, though: happiness manipulation right before the poll. Beer, pizza, Xbox partying, espresso carts, and even saying that bonuses are directly tied to the team getting stellar poll results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's Going on in India?&lt;/b&gt; Okay, &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/03/ms-poll-08.html"&gt;the last post&lt;/a&gt; also has a bit of a keg of gun powder in the comments, discussing the engineering quality of Microsoft India. Feel free to continue that conversation there, because the effective management of Microsoft India and Microsoft China is worthy of its own (&lt;i&gt;tricky&lt;/i&gt;) post. Starting that off for now, some comments like the following have popped up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I used to work in Microsoft India SMSG. In the past week, 10% of BMO quit. We've had people in EPG bail out in a hurry because the management does not care and is totally intellectually corrupt. Hiring is the exclusive domain of the GM who calls her cronies from HP to rape the company culture. I am done with MS India. DPE has a leader who is not a leader.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When people talk about MS Poll and how OHI has improved they forget that the the problem is that 50% of the hires in India are about a year old and they're still drinking the kool ade. To them, the mere act of joining Microsoft is something to be proud of. They're still giddy with delight at getting the MS offer letter because for years they have been shat upon by the Indian SIs they come from during their tenure there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We've got a CVP who is preoccupied with seeing his face in the newspaper and magazines. To him, success is the number of publication impressions and not the well being of the employees.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stock price?? It's important, but with grade levels sucking in India, the grants are miniscule. Unless of course you are a partner or VP in which case you are laughing all the way to the bank while the employees drive revenue and sweat in the mines.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the Microsoft India I left. I'm glad I am no longer part of it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have heard the same about India Dev Center also. Lot of people at lower levels (dev/dev-II) seem to be leaving the company and salary seems to be the primary motivation. In some cases, even the entry-level salaries at these "rival" companies is more than these people's (with 3-5 years experience) current salary.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How bad is things in Microsoft India? The GM Neelam Dhawan is fired and going back to HP. She is taking Rajiv Srivastava with her. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My friends and fellow Microsoft people, let me tell you that the situation in SMSG India is horrible. People are leaving and the leadership never meets the employees. We have box manufacturers trying to sell software. We have Chairman who I have not seen in 6 months in person. I have seen him on TV and the newspaper a few times. We have MD Neelam Dhawan who interviewed at Cisco 2 times and did not get a job there and is now going back to HP. The Country Manager for Xbox has left. BMO has almost 100% churn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forecast is... Suckage. Pure Suckage.&lt;/b&gt; Finally, from the &lt;i&gt;Thank God for Monster, Dice, and HotJobs&lt;/i&gt; department:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weekly reporting !!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Walmartization of Microsoft is now complete. I am in EPG and am now expected to give a weekly sales forecast. What crack is he smoking? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are tired of scorecards and metrics and now Weekly Fucking forecasts????&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will Kevin-the-used-car-salesman please leave the building?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SteveB - what WILL wake you up? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/1689924407143387944/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=1689924407143387944' title='240 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/1689924407143387944'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/1689924407143387944'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/04/microsoft-just-walk-on-by.html' title='Microsoft, Just Walk on By'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>240</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-4486771516271584122</id><published>2008-03-18T18:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-18T18:31:32.022-07:00</updated><title type='text'>MS Poll 08</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MS Poll 2008&lt;/b&gt;: what parts of the employee poll do you see as critical in communicating any changes that need to happen at Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Act Local&lt;/i&gt;: first of all, usually when I review poll results, my team looks at the questions and comments directly relevant to things that we can change. So if you want change in your day-to-day group, look hard at those questions that managers who report to a VP are accountable for. I can't count the number of times that we've looked through poll spreadsheets and some of the harshest numbers might be around "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Microsoft is headed in the right direction&lt;/span&gt;" or something, and nothing but shrugs result from those number since the reaction is usually, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;What can we do about that?&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've also been in meetings where we sit down and look at every comment, and figure out ownership and actions. Again, for things beyond our scope of impact we have to move on. But for serious comments that are relevant to the team a lot of attention is given. Strongly disagree about something? Note it and put in a fix for it in the comments later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I'm saying: act locally first and honestly assess your workgroup and put some effort into comments relevant to your group, probably noting the group's / VP's name specifically in the comment for any roll-up your comment goes into, should you have a senior VP (&lt;i&gt;or heaven forbid, a president&lt;/i&gt;) that actually glances through any of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Next, Think Globally for the Company&lt;/i&gt;: then there's the broader company wide feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I think we're headed in the right direction? No, not with our explosive employee growth and our highly questionable acquisition pursuit of Yahoo (&lt;i&gt;oof, sorry, I just had a mental image of a smirking Kevin Johnson wearing a black top-hat + cape and stroking his long, skinny waxed mustache&lt;/i&gt;). And I fear with all these new people and buildings, Redmond and Bellevue are about to turn into a constant parking lot (&lt;i&gt;especially when that monstrosity opens near Highway 520&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our systems and processes have exploded - and I'm not just talking about the pain in the butt magical commitment tool (&lt;i&gt;magical in that it can make comments *poof* disappear&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our rank and yank employee calibration doesn't align with valuing contributing to other people's success, so why even ask a question about being rewarded and recognized for that? Bring in some sort of team-based recognition and rewards and this will change.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow-up: hell yes your success is assessed relative to your peers. Duh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the first time I've pulled in and shorted the number of years I expect to continue working at Microsoft. Usually I'm all "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Here till I drop!&lt;/span&gt;" highly enthused, but now I'm concerned about the recent business decisions and the potential for that to make Microsoft go south, let alone the long-term impacts being felt now by the accrual of so many unneeded hires. Microsoft has the unfortunate potential to change so much that it will no longer be Microsoft to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As for a message to send upwards loud an clear about what motivates people to put in the extra effort, I think I can sum it up as: &lt;b&gt;stock&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has to start performing well. Our executive leadership doesn't believe that the stock performance matters, especially to employees. Does Microsoft stock price matter to you? I imagine you just said, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Hell yeah it does, Mini!&lt;/span&gt;" Let them know. If our stock started shooting up (&lt;i&gt;like it did oh so briefly&lt;/i&gt;) would you be more highly motivated and engaged in your job? If we hit $40? $50? If you started seeing the rewards of working at Microsoft around the stock you own and it actually being a benefit vs. a woeful joke going on over a half-a-decade, how would things change for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees have to say loud and clear, whether through the poll or other communications with leadership, that the Microsoft stock price does matter and it does make a difference. Want us to be bold? Re-invigorate the stock. Want us to take risks? Re-invigorate the stock. Want us to work above and beyond what's required of us? Re-invigorate the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And do other things like have a better 401k match and bring back the old ESPP. There it is, stock again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to put in any positive remarks about things going well so that they don't change for the worst. And if something needs to change, it's always best to put in the positive business-based solution vs. just asking the problem being addressed. Otherwise, you might not like the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think the poll is worth the effort, especially for provoking useful change in your group. As for a broader message, there's a potential that if key numbers radically change this year that it will be a wake up call. You might as well ring that bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/4486771516271584122/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=4486771516271584122' title='144 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4486771516271584122'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4486771516271584122'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/03/ms-poll-08.html' title='MS Poll 08'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>144</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-4356745523204919243</id><published>2008-03-02T17:55:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-03-02T17:58:57.473-08:00</updated><title type='text'>That Whistling Sound</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Some weeks you just feel like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_Road_Runner"&gt;Wile E. Coyote&lt;/a&gt;, beat up and dazed at the bottom of a canyon you just crash landed onto, wavering back and forth in the swirling dust while new knots grow out of your head and little concussion spirals spin above your black and blue eyes. And there's a shadow. A shadow that's growing bigger and bigger around you, and you wonder, where did that new Acme anvil get to, anyway, and what's that whistling sound? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to pop up the little umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what last week sort of felt like to me. Fines. Stock beat to hell and back. Incriminating emails showing up in the Vista incapable lawsuit. The Yahoo acquisition stumbling forward against the better judgment of the world. Friggin' bugs in the review tool that causes feedback to disappear in the HR IT bit-bucket (&lt;i&gt;hello, we have this neato homegrown technology called Word which tends not to lose things&lt;/i&gt;). OOXML on the ropes. Live-ID sign-in offline. Crap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fine, just fine&lt;/b&gt;: Shortly after the Steve / Brad / Ray show of all the new documentation we're unleashing on the world, the EU found that wallet they'd been feeling for as they groped us and slapped Microsoft with another big huge fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolores Umbrid- err, Neelie Kroes &lt;a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080227141558652"&gt;on this&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Talk, as you know, is cheap; flouting the rules is expensive, so to say. We don't want talk and promises, we want compliance. If you flout the rules you will be caught, and it will cost you dear.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which she added, her eyes blazing in Steve Ballmer's direction, "&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;I drink your milkshake!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" Quickly followed by an email to SteveB of a photo of her cat sitting on a wad of euros, captioned "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;I'm in ur profitz, stealin' ur cash.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel certainly should be worried, too, having had an EU raid on a European office recently. And Google shouldn't be too smug either: &lt;a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/66628-microsoft-is-the-eu-s-atm-machine-and-google-is-next?source=yahoo"&gt;Microsoft Is The EU's ATM Machine - And Google Is Next - Seeking Alpha&lt;/a&gt;. If you're #1 in something and not entwined around the success of an European partner / partner ecosystem, your butt is next to be hoisted upside down and shook until a few billion pop out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while I'm not going to go all Hank Reardon here and get upset about documenting how our particular kind of industrial steel works, I am having negative tit-for-tat protectionist reactions. I'm human: my company is bleeding fines - fines we'll pay especially given the Yahoo in-play factor - and nary a word from the US government saying, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Hey, whoa, we'd like some of that cash to stay local here.&lt;/span&gt;" And don't get me started about fairness. This is international economic political reality, which is about as far from fair as you can get, although all sides can certainly enshroud themselves in the mien fairness as they speak their piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My expectation is, just like Windows XP N, a lot of this will just go unused. I mean, I guess if I go to Hell one of the first punishments will be "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;Here's the Exchange protocol documentation. Please write a server that works against this protocol.&lt;/span&gt;" Probably followed by something much, much worse, "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;Here's the Sharepoint protocol doc-&lt;/span&gt;" "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No&lt;/b&gt;! Just gut me or do something with fire ants and a poker already!&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that the cash goes to something useful at the end of the day. You know, something better than ill-advised acquisitions, SPSA pay-outs, and hiring lots and lots of more Microsofties to do less and less. Hmm. Perhaps I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; warm up to these fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who said what? And they're still employed?&lt;/b&gt; Ah, email discovery. What's the point in having an ass if it you can't do something that comes around and gets your squarely bit in said ass? Some of those email exchanges I already kind of expected, but the one about possible collusion with Intel to support their chipset? Double d'oh with an oy-vey on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop: &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/132891.asp"&gt;Full text Microsoft execs on Vista problems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/132989.asp"&gt;Vista How cozy were Microsoft and Intel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Joe Wilcox: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/intelmicrosoft_graphicsgate_part_1.html"&gt;Microsoft Watch - Corporate - Intel-Microsoft Vistagate, Part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/intel-microsoft_graphicsgate_part_2.html"&gt;Microsoft Watch - Corporate - Intel-Microsoft Vistagate, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MSFTExtremeMakeover: &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-just-in-svp-will-poole-certifies.html"&gt;Breaking News CVP Will Poole Certifies Another Laptop as Vista Capable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Busted. This is where you reach for the wallet (&lt;i&gt;if you can evade Ms. Kroes sticky fingers on an interception route&lt;/i&gt;) and just pay-up. In my opinion, we screwed up here, badly. God forbid if any of those friggin' Vista Capable stickers showed up in the EU...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rewarding&lt;/b&gt;: so how was the Microsoft Technical Recognition Awards in La Quinta, CA this year? I still don't know why they need to go all the way the hell down to California for the technical semi-Partner achievement getaway. Oh, wait, getaway. And hey, didn't the Watson guys win last year, too? Sorry, but with everything going on and the stock down on the low end of $27, more weenies and less shrimp for the SPSA crowd would be mighty nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silverlight lining&lt;/b&gt;: I can only hope that some good will and interesting results come out of Mix08 and our own Tech Fest. The last two Tech Fest have been really interesting for me. This one I don't have as high hopes for, having gone through the initial list, but that leaves the door for me to be pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after this week, you've got to wonder: can it get any worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's that whistling sound?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/4356745523204919243/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=4356745523204919243' title='132 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4356745523204919243'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/4356745523204919243'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/03/that-whistling-sound.html' title='That Whistling Sound'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>132</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-694275409477363729</id><published>2008-02-25T22:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-25T22:18:29.270-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Because the Last Aquisition Went So Well...</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check-in on Yahoo&lt;/b&gt;: BusinessWeek has a small &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/02/microsofts_new.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_blogspotting"&gt;take on Kevin Johnson's message to Microsoft and Yahoo employees&lt;/a&gt;. A number of articles have been posted putting this email in the light of "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;we're not going to be firing anybody! Please, don't leave, we luv you all and we have someplace to squeeze you in!&lt;/span&gt;" After our own CEO basically lied to his own senior leadership regarding the Yahoo acquisition, I'm not buying anything they are selling because their agenda, whatever it is, is built on misrepresentation. Or shooting from the hip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, of course, I want folks fired due to my original agenda; plus, the Yahoo Peanut Butter Manifesto probably pointed to more than just 1,000 Yahoo folks needing to find a better place to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading Mr. Johnson's email, I have an image in my head of John Wayne from &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057298/"&gt;McLintock&lt;/a&gt;, reassuringly saying in this case, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Somebody needs to fire ya, kid.

And maybe this is part of the MS problem? SMSG is swarming with people and due to the "Keep your scorecard green" culture that came with Kevin "thank you for all that you do" Turner, managers are not managing and coaching people anymore. Every day I see people that should be empowered to do business staring into their spreadsheets in order manipulate Siebel (yes we use that utter crap CRM system still) to keep the scorecard green instead of going out to meet the customers. Many MS people in (i think especially in services) miss the "techy" culture where we doing good things for customers, making them successful. Now all we get "Why is your scorecard yellow, just fix it".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty aQuantive laundry&lt;/b&gt;: a very &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/02/some-quick-quips-yahoo-86-and-mspoll.html#c4921074251026762362"&gt;revealing comment worth reading in full&lt;/a&gt; starts with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm no longer with aQuantive, I now work for a great team in MS. I was threatened not to talk, but my story needs to be told, to some people higher up who believe that they can integrate Yahoo, I believe that they can, but they have to hear what is happening to Microsoft's ad serving business, which will save the company years to find out, it will be too late once they realize. The engineers at aQuantive are great, some of the best, but the central nervous system doesn't exist, this is Microsoft's managements responsibility, and it could cost us the leadership in the ad business. [...]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classy, real classy&lt;/b&gt;: I'm sure anyone who had ran Vista at work looked at the Vista Capable stickers on machines they wouldn't buy for their Mom and felt bad regarding the misrepresentation of those machines' capabilities. Even some of our VPs expressed their strong dislike (&lt;i&gt;d'oh, [shake fist] damn you email discovery!&lt;/i&gt;). Now we're up for a &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23322174/"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; and I'm really interested to see what kind of leg we have to stand on here. Fighting to justify this poor decision doesn't rank up as high on the Bozo Meter as trying to defend browsing technology as being a core OS component, but it's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rory Blyth channels Mini&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2008/02/12/29110.aspx"&gt;Windows Live Writer Team and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; - where Rory is put over the edge when Live Writer - a delightful blogging application I adore (&lt;i&gt;and makes me wonder if my hatred of .NET apps is misplaced&lt;/i&gt;) - gets ruined by being wedged into a Live Suite installer infrastructure. Rory is &lt;a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2007/09/30/27359.aspx"&gt;no longer with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and he doesn't hesitate to load up both barrels and let loose. A little later in the comment stream:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happened to me is I worked for Microsoft for three years. You didn't read the post in its entirety, so you may have missed it, but I wrote that this isn't just about Live Writer - it's about Microsoft's approach to user experience in general.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I saw - and was subject to - so many dirty tricks on the inside. There's a constant battle between the stupid people and the smart people, and the stupid people do quite well. Probably because stupid people are scared of the smart people and do whatever they can to get more stupid people to work at Microsoft. A good way to retain your power and position is to ensure you aren't being challenged by other employees.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The sad thing is that I'm not exaggerating.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The company is bloated. I said myself that firing tens of thousands is cruel, but when you have managers for managers for managers for managers for managers for managers and managers for them, you have something ridiculous.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firing tens of thousands of Microsofties? Allow me to raise my hands in the air, wave them about, and yell out, "&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Hallelujah brother, praise the RIF!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-year career discussion is upon us and now is an ideal time for you to update your resume and assess where you are and where you are going. Want a raise? Secret to Success, rule #1: the best way to get a raise is to change companies. Bar none. So update that resume and see what kind of follow-ups you get. Perhaps you're an eagle trying to soar with the turkeys... if so, some parting advice from &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/02/some-quick-quips-yahoo-86-and-mspoll.html#c2617128228739529337"&gt;one of our commenters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I left months ago and am so glad I did. MSFT has a bunch of great achievers drowning amongst a gaggle of whiners who want top pay and work-life balance but don't want to work hard to achieve anything. Until you get rid of the latter, you wont' get top performance out of the former. The people who want challenges in life and to achieve something will just continue to get fed up and leave. It's sad. If you are there and frustrated there are many alternative lives you could be leading happily elsewhere. Go, it ain't that scary and you'll never regret it. Stay and you'll wake up at 45 yrs old (how many 45+ people do you see around you, eh?) sad and feeling empty. Go, leave, it's okay and you'll stop feeling so angry and abused.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/694275409477363729/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=694275409477363729' title='85 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/694275409477363729'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/694275409477363729'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/02/because-last-aquisition-went-so-well.html' title='Because the Last Aquisition Went So Well...'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>85</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-2563896505420181260</id><published>2008-02-17T21:59:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-17T22:07:51.043-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Some Quick Quips - Yahoo, #86, and MSPoll</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Just some quick quips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;yahoo&lt;/b&gt;...

Mr. Yang calls out, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;White Knight? Anyone? Anyone?&lt;/span&gt;" and the Yahoo board gets restless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting bit comes from &lt;a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB120311977865672785.html?mod=b_hpp_9_0002_b_this_weeks_magazine_home_right"&gt;Joe Rosenberg in Barron's&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2008/02/17/joe_rosenberg_a.html"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080217/tc_nm/microsoft_yahoo_dc_1"&gt;Microsoft bid for Yahoo makes no sense&lt;/a&gt;. Some interesting snippets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It's a bad refection on Ballmer that he's willing to pay a ridiculous price for Yahoo. Microsoft is not going to earn anything like a reasonable rate of return in Yahoo," Rosenberg was quoted as saying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Asked if it wasn't a strategic necessity for Microsoft to buy Yahoo, Rosenberg said: "I don't buy that. Yahoo would significantly dilute Microsoft's returns.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Ballmer is a great operating man but he lacks financial acumen. He ought to be thinking more of Microsoft employees who own a lot of Microsoft stock and have nothing to show for it in many years. If the stock doesn't start doing better, Microsoft will lose good people."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness someone is actually thinking that employees would react to the stock price, because it seems to be a foreign concept to our leadership. I can't make jokes about Golden Handcuffs anymore because most people at Microsoft don't know what the hell I'm talking about. I have not seen Microsofties so loose in their sockets since I joined years upon years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agent 86&lt;/b&gt;: Would you believe... that &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2008/snapshots/86.html"&gt;Microsoft has dropped down to #86&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2008/"&gt;Fortune Best Places to Work survey&lt;/a&gt;? That's down from &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2007/snapshots/50.html"&gt;#50 in 2007&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2006/snapshots/879.html"&gt;#42 in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. Like a rock. In a bad way. And who is #1 for two years in a row? Grab that chair and give it a big effen toss in the air to &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2008/snapshots/1.html"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;! Toot! They &lt;a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-filings-watch-googles-10-k-headcount-acquisition-spend/"&gt;get bigger&lt;/a&gt; and they're still #1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Oh, and Yahoo is attached to our hip at #87. I guess we're more alike than we knew.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LisaB tackled the #86 issue this past week. Kinda. But I've got to wonder: if you sat down a bunch of hard-working, valued Microsofties in one room, and executive leadership in the other, and put down some simple questions like, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;What would make employees value working at Microsoft even more?&lt;/span&gt;" I'm pretty sure the answers would have a wide gap between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return of the towels was a symbolic admission to stupidity. The Bread and Circuses of various subsequent benefits doesn't align with what Microsofties need to be obviously valued and to have a great career at Microsoft that is satisfying. What would you want to see Microsoft do about addressing being a great place to work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My #1 request has got to be to make Microsofties mobile. Intent to interview was a great first step. Now, just let people interview. If they get the job, their management learns they need to start a transition plan. Leaders might actually start managing their teams as if retention matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, given Mid-Year Career Discussions, my #2 request is to boot all the friggin' tools and go back to the Microsoft Word form, all a part of streamlining career management at Microsoft. We're about to spend a couple of months in tool hell, have a big CSP codified discussion that may or may not align with the reality of your group, and then in three months do it all over again for the major review cycle. I seem to spend my life in calibration meetings and managing tools and asking HR-IT to fix bungled work-flow and whacked-out permissions. I need a "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;I'd rather be shipping features that make money&lt;/span&gt;" license plate holder. As do many of my team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My #3 is too intangible to tackle here, but it's more around gearing Microsoft to be a team-focused company culture, not the lone-rock-star-wolf. Yes, still reward the rock-star contributors, but also reward the teams that produce great results that they've committed to, and punish and don't reward dysfunctional teams that don't deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and return the old ESPP and up the 401k match to be something stellar. Worried about cost? Headcount reduction works wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MSPoll&lt;/b&gt;: Oh, and if you have ideas but don't feel like sharing them here, you can at least achieve some catharsis in writing your thoughts up in the upcoming poll. Maybe when it goes online we can find a few questions to hammer on to make a (&lt;i&gt;useless?&lt;/i&gt;) point. I can tell you, with the Yahoo acquisition still in play and the impact that it's had to the stock and the reputation of Microsoft, I've got to say the question addressing "this company is headed in the right direction" should take a nosedive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.S.&lt;/b&gt; I'm going to mention Steven Sinofsky here (&lt;i&gt;which I've avoided a lot, although I'm a great fan, because every time I think of typing something about him I hear in my mind batteries clattering down a wooden staircase and then imagine his angry, disappointed face appearing out of the shadows at the top of the stairs... scary stuff&lt;/i&gt;): so &lt;a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080211/yellow-harvest-trailer/"&gt;does this mean that Sinofsky is destined to be Mini-ized&lt;/a&gt;? Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.P.S.&lt;/b&gt; Some executives moved around last week. One surprise departure, otherwise everything else seemed to have been whispered about for a while. Mr. Ballmer's email was interesting in that it seemed to imply that there was a whiff of accountability in the air with what was going on. Just a whiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/2563896505420181260/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=2563896505420181260' title='166 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/2563896505420181260'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/2563896505420181260'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/02/some-quick-quips-yahoo-86-and-mspoll.html' title='Some Quick Quips - Yahoo, #86, and MSPoll'/><author><name>Who da'Punk</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18205453956191063442</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>166</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7555958.post-247750891799761063</id><published>2008-02-10T11:21:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-10T11:30:12.377-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Microsoft's Yahoo! Acquisition is Bold. And Dumb.</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Please, Yahoo!: fight to stay independent. Or at least tear yourself apart and pop a couple of poison pills to go out on your own terms before this goes much further. Yeah, I've got your &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/02/reaction-from-t.html"&gt;double-suck cake for you&lt;/a&gt;: one layer Yahoo!, one layer Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was on the internal Microsoftie bandwagon that Steve Ballmer was steering not too long ago that an &lt;a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/02/microsoft-and-yahoo-stay-on-target.html"&gt;acquisition of Yahoo! didn't make sense for Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. So when the unsolicited offer went through, I was like a whole bunch of other confused senior people looking around trying to figure out what changed and why this suddenly was the right thing to do and to bet the company on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize that huge change for the future is typically greeted with 95% critical negativity. People don't like to change and huge change is an immense leadership challenge, especially when the change is the right thing to do and very few can see that perspective. So I've done my best to be open and accept that Yahoo!'s acquisition by Microsoft is a good strategic move for Microsoft, for our customer's, for Yahoo!'s customers, the shareholders, and for Internet users in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't gotten there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, this still seems like a real dumb idea, like a staggering drunk trying to prop himself on an unwilling and lame adversary who wouldn't mind seeing the drunk facedown on the pavement. The only arguments that are half appealing are those that suppose there's going to be a $110,000,000,000USD annual online ad-market, and Microsoft + Yahoo! gets a third of that market. Hand-waving, "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;The acquisition pays for itself!&lt;/span&gt;" Yeah, okay, give me that dream and a milkshake and at least I get to enjoy the milkshake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some interesting posts on this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop: &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/131501.asp?source=rss"&gt;What's next Microsoft's options after Yahoo rejection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ms. Mary Jo Foley: &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1170"&gt;What’s Microsoft’s Plan B?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MSFTExtremeMakeover: &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/02/media-roundup.html"&gt;Media Roundup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/02/having-fun-yet.html"&gt;Having Fun Yet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/02/is-like-person-who-completely-lost-his.html"&gt; This is like a person who's completely lost his mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Nathan Weinberg: &lt;a href="http://microsoft.blognewschannel.com/archives/2008/02/04/some-microsoftyahoo-overlap-you-may-not-have-considered/"&gt;Some Microsoft/Yahoo Overlap You May Not Have Considered&lt;/a&gt;. I like Nathan's comments here. It's interesting how many technologies of Yahoo! he declares as being "dead." Why are we paying for dead stuff again? We're not taxidermists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/2004172524_yahooed10.html"&gt;Creating Micro-Hoo&lt;/a&gt;: a pro-acquisition editorial from the Seattle Times, taking a bit of a personal view of Google's impact on the newspaper industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Philip Greenspun: &lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2008/02/09/microsoft-is-2000-times-less-effective-than-google-yahoo-board-seems-to-be-insane/"&gt;Microsoft is 2000 times less effective than Google; Yahoo Board seems to be insane&lt;/a&gt;: snippet: "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;The interesting question is why a company that claims to know how to program would pay anything for Yahoo, much less a P/E ratio of more than 60.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Henry Blodget: &lt;a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/2/microsoft__yahoo_will_be_our__google_apps_"&gt;Microsoft's Colossal Strategic Mistake We Need to Be in Advertising - Silicon Alley Insider&lt;/a&gt;. Right. Ads?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course there's one big thing I haven't touched on: headcount. Let's see, why did I start this blog? Oh, yes: Microsoft has become way too huge to be effective and nimble in the creation of focused, passion-driven software. Fourteen-thousand or so demoralized people thrown on the heap does not help in the least. That's the amount we need to go down, not up. What is this, Bizarro Microsoft? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you brought up &lt;a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/4/1/64125bb7-4e6f-4111-a823-30b9eb15c38f/HeadTraxVisioTechnicalCaseStudy.doc"&gt;HeadTrax&lt;/a&gt; recently to see how many positions report up to the top? Give it a go. And how many people report to the various presidents. Any surprises?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft absorbing Yahoo! doesn't make sense to me given the extreme overlap in offerings that neither Microsoft nor Yahoo! have been terribly effective at. How many success stories have there been lately at Yahoo!? I like their portal. I use their search on occasion (&lt;i&gt;only when Live Search and Google give me disappointing results&lt;/i&gt;). And their acquisition of flickr was really good for them, along with not screwing flickr up (&lt;i&gt;and flickr users, you gotta know Microsoft would be pretty hands-off of flickr, other than probably putting a Live ID sign-in bar or such on there&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only argument I've heard that makes sense from a conspiratorial Machiavellian kind of angle is that this is an opportunistic move to bust and cripple the already lame business adversary we have in Yahoo! We don't really want Yahoo!, but rather see this as an opportunity to kneecap and sideline them, pointing out their vulnerability to acquisition and angering their frustrated shareholders into revolt, all while putting them under the microscope of the analysts, pointing out their various failed and marginal ventures. And some glimmers of potential. But mostly, Yahoo! continues to come up in an unflattering light as people scratch their head as to how they'd help Microsoft at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the acquisition doesn't go through, Yahoo! certainly emerges with several broken bones and bruises. Rebuilding from that will be a struggle that will require drastic and draconian decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the MSN, search, and ads folk at Microsoft certainly shouldn't be too proud right now, because you guys are under as much scrutiny as Yahoo!. Why are we proposing blowing $22,000,000,000USD in cash and going into debt? Because Yahoo! has something done right - relative to us, according to our leadership - that you haven't been able to do. Is there a Microsoft online-services leadership shake-up coming? One can hope. The fact that we've initiated this acquisition, for whatever reason, means that the people in charge haven't been able to deliver and are not on a path to deliver. Accountability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do want to see the strategic importance in this huge, complicated take-over. I do want to believe. If this all about ads and the acquisition goes forward I need the &lt;a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/The-25-Most-Influential-People-at-Microsoft/"&gt;influentials in Microsoft leadership&lt;/a&gt; to connect with me and convince me to believe that this is indeed the next important foundation for Microsoft. To tell you the truth, if you had pulled me aside when I was in school, holding court in the computer science lab, and whispered in my ear ala The Graduate: "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;&lt;i&gt;online ads...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" I would have laughed my geek butt off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Google gets to have the joke on me, but for us to bet the company and build Microsoft's future foundation on ads revenue? WTF? As someone who considers themselves a &lt;a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/350593_faith09.html"&gt;citizen, not a consumer,&lt;/a&gt; I want to create software experiences that make people's lives delightful and better, not that sells them crap they don't need while putting them deeper into debt. I'm going to be in purgatory long enough as is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, okay, we should have a team do an advertising platform and do it well, but the money chest can be better invested across the company, let alone avoiding going into debt and putting us on another spiral of doubt and angst in the stock market, all while dealing with anti-trust maneuvering in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attempt to acquire Yahoo! is a bold move. But bold and dumb are not exclusive. &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx"&gt;Q.E.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/mini-microsoft"&gt;Mini-Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/msft" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/msft"&gt;MSFT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="http://technorati.com/tag/yhoo" rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/yhoo"&gt;YHOO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/feeds/247750891799761063/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7555958&amp;postID=247750891799761063' title='146 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/247750891799761063'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7555958/posts/default/247750891799761063'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2008/02/microsofts-yahoo-acquisition-is-bold.html' title='Microsoft&apos;s Yahoo!

Thank goodness we can take a break from talking about Win7 M1 leaks for a while. And thanks for the quality of comments in the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Update: Google just posted about Yahoo! and Microsoft: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html"&gt;Yahoo! and the future of the Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; - things are going to get &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080203/p17#a080203p17"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080203/p17#a080203p17"&gt; interesting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a check-in on what &lt;a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080201/h1700"&gt;TechMeme looked like at the end of the day on Friday the first&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not even going to begin to try to point to interesting articles: there is an abundance. Most cluster around "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;two wrongs don't make a right.&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; are extreme in how bad an idea this is, and others are extreme in how good an idea this is. I like those that bring up the spirit of competition, saying that the combined entity would give a serious option to Google (&lt;i&gt;which would help with prices&lt;/i&gt;) and that it would keep Google sharp and competitive (&lt;i&gt;good for Google fans&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've spent time checking in with various people I know to hear their opinion about the hosti- er - unsolicited offer and how it might impact them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;I found out if you really want to piss some people off, send them an email with snarky Yahoo! questions. They've gone through disclosure and, man, they don't want to do that again. And I guess neither do I. So, no more electronic Y! trail there. Word to the wise.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactions from most Microsofties: talk to me in a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one anticipates anything happening by the end of this year, between the additional financial courting that might happen between Yahoo! and other suitors and then the subsequent complicated international regulatory phase. During a US election year, to boot. Here &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Nellie%20Kroes"&gt;Nellie&lt;/a&gt; was getting bored and trawling through Office protocols. Consider this an early Valentine, Ms. Kroes. &lt;i&gt;Mmmm-wha!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no way this is happening fast. Microsofties in groups most affected by a Yahoo! acquisition are plowing ahead, course unchanged, for the foreseeable future. No thoughts around brand or collaboration or nada. "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;Stay on target.&lt;/span&gt;" Uh-huh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most engineers, as expected of engineers, see all the problems and that it's going to be a staggering mess, let alone that there are &lt;a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080202/microsoft-yahoo-big-mess-comparison/"&gt;things that Yahoo! does way better than us and that our stuff should be dropped&lt;/a&gt;. Strategic optimists and those looking for a promotion will rebrand it as a synergistic opportunity to align our technological assets into a virtuous, hyper-competitive cycle to benefit our users, partners, and shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get ready to find out what someone trying to make Partner or VP at Microsoft is all about, dear Yahoos. Be sure to ask about SPSA goals for a successful integration of Yahoo! and Microsoft assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the basics, though, our imperial Lego blocks and their metric Lego blocks use very differently sized connectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm more concerned about the Yahoo! workforce. The talented remaining in the Yahoo! workforce, specifically. What a sucky week of events for them. Two weeks, really. Layoff rumors, bad financial results, layoff for real, and then a big corporation darkening their door, sans chocolates, saying that we're done with the sweet-nuthins-talk and it's time for my way or the highway. Well, actually, saying that it's time for my way or my way. What's a Yahoo to do? Wait it out, keeping things purring along? Start learning Windows Server, IIS, .NET, and Silverlight? Jump ship for a start-up, right in the middle of a looming recession? Damn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I've said here over and over again, talent is talent and if you're good you can decide what you want to do and where you want to be. You're not locked into Yahoo! anymore than any Microsoftie is locked into Microsoft. It's a choice. And to feel good about your choice, you need to know and explore all of your options. There are no victims here. And the risk of that is that when the acquisition goes through, those left are those who either can't or won't find a position elsewhere. How much passion will remain? How do you keep the engagement going?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can help Yahoos explore Microsoft and it's culture, I'm happy to help. Realize this isn't the sunshine and teddy bear ice-cream parade site, though. I know little about Yahoo! culture so I don't know how different it is from Microsoft, although comments from former Microsofties tell me that its engineering groups aren't too different (&lt;i&gt;which might be good and bad&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft leadership also has to realize that the "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;Stay on Target&lt;/span&gt;" strategy isn't going to work for groups that heavily overlap with Yahoo! or would be replaced by Yahoo! implementations. On the surface, the coming year or two for a lot of online groups is looking like nothing more than a lot of angst, crap, and loss of momentum and brand. Why not dive into &lt;a href="http://career/"&gt;http://career/&lt;/a&gt; and find something more rewarding? What's the reward for staying on target? It certainly looks like a bold opportunity to break through, but it has to be recognized as such and driven as such. Otherwise, it becomes the elephant in the All-Hands that starts chasing people out of the group, looking for a vision and hearing none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then: Ballmer. This will certainly serve as a transition out of the Gates era. Is Ballmer an Ahab figure, chasing the white whale of Google once and for all by roping two whaling ships together? If I write a book on my years at Microsoft one day, will it start out as "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;Call me Mini,&lt;/span&gt;" as I reflect on the Microsoft flotsam and jetsam swirling around the world? I hope not. This &lt;u&gt;will&lt;/u&gt; serve to define Ballmer, however. All online decisions and strategies have led to this point. And the scale of leadership required to pull success out of this bold move is, to tell you the truth, beyond any accomplishments I've seen so far. I have hope, but not much to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this pretty much puts on the kibosh on any other big acquisitions for a while. So no need to speculate about Microsoft buying Adobe or anything like that. For now. One less thread for the rumor mill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Update: s/Yahooligans/Yahoos/g per comment.

Internally, a number of us had heard reasons from Steve Ballmer why a Yahoo! acquisition didn't make sense. One that sticks in my mind right now is how if we acquired Yahoo! - such a big company - we'd have to naturally have &lt;b&gt;layoffs&lt;/b&gt; within Microsoft to accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are HR people wandering around Microsoft this morning asking, "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;What color slip did you say? Pink?&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man, if I was in the Online Services Division I would be worried. Especially if Yahoo! did something my team did and did it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess you can track down the 10:00am meeting and see if you can get your question answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-four point six billion US dollars. In long hand: $44,600,000,000 USD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if your team is naturally at risk due to the acquisition I would start checking in on your local network and see what's going on elsewhere in Microsoft. If there's someone within Microsoft you've always wanted on your team that has some turbulence ahead due to the acquisition (&lt;i&gt;yeah, I know, Ballmer's telling us "&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"&gt;stay on target&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;) check in with them and tell them the groovy things your group is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the buy goes through, it will be one huge turning point for Microsoft: I think we'll either turn it around brilliantly and our mega-investment will be worth it, or we'll be torn asunder and revert back to our core cash cows. It will be a story worth telling, one way or the other. In the meantime, that big huge money-chest is going to go empty, and that might bring a new sense of clarity to our operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial posts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop: &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/130801.asp?source=rss"&gt;Microsoft's big Yahoo bid Behind-the-scenes details&lt;/a&gt; - nice flow of updates over time and info on the Yahoo! board.

I'll be interested in hearing if we have anything encouraging to say as being a safe-haven for investors during this period, given the current releases and the upcoming releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/130152.asp?source=rss"&gt;has a preview and nails my concern about the analysts concern&lt;/a&gt; of our forward looking statements. Also - though I doubt it will come up except as a generalized catch-all warning - with the EU feeling us up again to try to figure where we moved our wallet to, we have more legal uncertainty to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update: After the release...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FY08Q1: &lt;b&gt;ba-da-Boom&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FY08Q2: &lt;b&gt;ba-da-BING&lt;/b&gt;!

He expressed extreme pleasure over the results, as do I imagine every Microsoftie (&lt;i&gt;unless you do want to point at the stinky poo of OSB and how E&amp;amp;D / Xbox has a deep, deep hole of billions to fill income into&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd say every time I heard an analyst try to give Mr. Liddell a soft-pitch opportunity to say something negative or overly cautious, Mr. Liddell was like, "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;Nope, things are going great, and will continue going great. Or greater.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe-haven for the investors' money, indeed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and kudos to Jason Maynard for asking Liddell about the new EU actions and how that figured into Liddell's thinking. Not much of a meaty answer (&lt;i&gt;well, most of the answers weren't very meaty&lt;/i&gt;) but it was nice to hear such a challenging question. I hope it comes up again during our Friday Town Hall Meeting in 34, though I wouldn't expect a more detailed answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up posts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSFTExtremeMakeover: &lt;a href="http://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2008/01/q2-fy08-earnings.html"&gt;Q2 FY08 Earnings&lt;/a&gt;. Snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Short version: strong results, increased guidance, generally upbeat tone, and no really embarrassing items for analysts to question. Good job! Yes, online continues to be a sinkhole for cash. But everyone is used to that by now, and at least the top line result is semi-respectable. Yes, there's still no color on actual large scale Vista deployments. But at least client revenue and unearned remains solid. Bottom line, if last report was sufficient to get some investors to take another look at MSFT, then this one should attract others and perhaps reduce doubts that last time was merely a fluke. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Joe Wilcox: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/microsoft_q2_2008_by_the_numbers.html"&gt;Microsoft Watch - Corporate - Microsoft Q2 2008 by the Numbers&lt;/a&gt;. Snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Liddell's confidence may have something to do with where Microsoft makes its money. Just four years ago, the majority of revenue came from North America. Now, 60 percent of sales are outside the United States, Liddell said. For the quarter, Microsoft sales increased 30 percent in emerging markets, 20 percent in established markets like Europe and 15 percent in the United States. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even if the U.S. economy slows down, overseas sales could offset any decreases in technology spending here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Todd Bishop: &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/130219.asp?source=rss"&gt;Microsoft beats quarterly estimates, raises forecast&lt;/a&gt;. Snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Microsoft's Online Services Business was the only one of the company's five divisions to post an operating loss for the quarter, $245 million in the red. The company's Entertainment and Devices Division climbed to a $357 million operating profit thanks to holiday video-game sales. Chris Liddell, the company's chief financial officer, said this afternoon that Microsoft is still expecting that division to be profitable for the full fiscal year, which ends in June.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the general attitude of the rest of the reports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/portfolio/080124/dcr7386af57f7365d02cce2ec4834bc5646.html?.v=2"&gt;Microsoft in the Money Financial News - Yahoo!

"&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;You have to look really hard to find any weakness in our results,&lt;/span&gt;" Liddell said.

"&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;We see it as a multiyear journey that we're going on,&lt;/span&gt;" he said, adding that Microsoft hopes the unit will "&lt;span style="color:#000080;"&gt;be at a critical mass in several years.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/24/microsoft-technology-vista-markets-equity-cx-ra-0124markets29.html?partner=yahootix"&gt;Command Performance By Microsoft - Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;. Two interesting snips here: (1) [Trip Chowdhry] said there was no indication as of yet that Google Docs, Google’s online office tools program, has negatively impacted Microsoft.  (2) A major shift in the marketplace, Chowdhry said, is that the rapidly growing BRIC nations--Brazil, Russia, India and China--have realized that open-source software, where anyone can copy anything, is not the way a country builds core competencies in technology. Microsoft did well in BRIC nations during the second quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/080124/microsoft.html?.v=8"&gt;Microsoft profit rises 79 pct Financial News - Yahoo!
