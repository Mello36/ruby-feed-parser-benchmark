			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I use Firefox at work, and Safari on my Mac at home&#8230; I use the best browser for the job depending on the operating system I am using at the time. Never in my wildest dreams would it have crossed my mind that a specific ethnic group would need their own web browser.</p>
<p>Well apparently the folks behind &#8220;<a href="http://www.blackbirdhome.com/">Blackbird</a>&#8221; feel that there is apparently a void in web browsers designed around black people. Yes, you read that right&#8230; a web browser for blacks. It is apparently written to bring news and events relevant to the black community to the front of the stack. Some of their noted features include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Search</li>
<li>Black News Ticker</li>
<li>Black Bookmarks</li>
</ul>
<p>Hell, even the browser is black.</p>
<p>Is this really where we&#8217;re headed? Will the Native Americans adopt Firefox? Jolly British folk adopt Safari? Latinos inherit Camino? Give me a break!</p>
<p>If race based news is of the utmost importance to you, chances are you&#8217;re already adept at finding the news you are looking for, why bring race into browser selection? What&#8217;s next, purchasing a computer and specifying your race so they preload it with the correct, ethnically balanced software?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mayors across the country have figured out the trick. The economy is slumping and the imperial federal government is writing blank checks. Where do we line up?</p>
<p>Barack Obama is going to save the planet by creating infrastructure projects and negate these recent job losses by &#8220;creating jobs&#8221;. The only problem is, if this <a href="http://usmayors.org/mainstreeteconomicrecovery/documents/mser-report-200812.pdf">recent report </a>of &#8220;ready-to-go infrastructure projects&#8221; by the U.S Conference of Mayors is any predictor of things to come our taxes will be tapped for a whole lot of nothing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of projects in this list and I&#8217;m noticing a trend&#8230; the gap between dollars spent and jobs created is HUGE.</p>
<ul>
<li>a proposed &#8220;O&#8217;Malley Road Reconstruction&#8221; in Anchorage, Alaska, that will cost $30 million but provide 300 jobs.</li>
<li>Police Facility Solar Panels for Lake Havasu City, Arizona, for only $400,000 and 75 jobs.</li>
<li>Stormwater Settlement Ponds for Beloit, Wisconsin for <strong>$1.5 million</strong> and five jobs.</li>
<li>The storm sewer system in St. John, Indiana needs &#8220;additional capacity.&#8221; $275,000 and 15 jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s 4 projects, <strong>$32,175,000</strong> spent and a whopping 395 Jobs created.</p>
<p>If the unemployment rate is 6.1%&#8230; you&#8217;ve just dropped that percentage by 0.002%</p>
<p>OUTSTANDING! Just imagine how many jobs we can create with all this money we don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p><strong>Updates in BOLD.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When this housing bubble mess started, politicians and community organizers were shouting from on high that the almighty federal government could easily fix the plight of these poor homeowners being faced with foreclosures on their beloved homes, if only they could be allowed to refinance or receive assistance.</p>
<p>Well, get ready for the shock of a lifetime&#8230; those people who had no business owning that house in the first place, are apparently RE-defaulting on their home loans even after being bailed out the first time. Information due out from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision (did you even KNOW there was such an office?) shows that more than 58% of those who received restructured mortgages to stave off foreclosure have re-defaulted on their loans. Brilliant!</p>
<p>When asked why this is happening, the OCC only had this to say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know the answers yet, but these are the types of questions that we have begun asking our servicers in detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know WHY people are re-defaulting on their loans? Send someone from the Office of Thrift Supervision over to investigate&#8230; once they&#8217;re done watching the BCS Championship on the 50&#8243; Flat Screen I&#8217;m sure they can scratch together some reason why these people can&#8217;t seem to scrape up the money for their mortgage payments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I have zero sympathy with MOST people who cannot pay their bills. If you can&#8217;t afford it, you should not have it. End of story.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court today, decided not to hear a case in which soon to be President-Elect Barack Obama&#8217;s natural born citizenship has been called into question.</p>
<p>Certain people are calling into question Obama&#8217;s natural born citizenship by claiming the certificate of live birth he had up on his campaign website was a forgery, claiming he renounced his US Citizenship to attend school as an Indonesian citizen, even claiming he was born in Kenya or pretty much anything else you can come up with.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not alone in this, as during the campaign the New York Times ran a hit piece on John McCain questioning his citizenship due to his birth in Panama. They later had to apologize for the article once proof was rendered.</p>
<p>Here is one VERY good reason why Obama WILL be the next President of the United States and everyone should get one with their lives. <strong>The court simply WILL NOT invalidate the votes of 66 Million voters.</strong> Period. Never going to happen in a million years unless there was a mountain of proof a mile high&#8230; which there isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To those of you who are spending every waking hour on this subject, put some clothes on, get your butt out of your chair and go get some fresh air. GET OVER IT.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;holiday tree&#8221; and a Christian Nativity Scene have been erected at the Capitol Building in Olympia, WA&#8230; a gesture some would say crosses the line between religion and government. The government issued permits for a public display to private organizations, and since we&#8217;re being snooty about the tree by labeling it a &#8220;holiday tree&#8221; I&#8217;m willing to let that line be crossed. The third addition to the group is what has my attention.</p>
<p>An Atheist organization has erected a third display, in the form of a placard that reads;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are no gods, no devils, no angels, no heaven or hell. There is only our natural world. Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, our Constitution provides any and all citizens with the freedom of religion&#8230; allowing for coexistence between Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Shintoists and yes, even Atheists. If you want to erect a shrine celebrating your holiday, so be it. Where I draw the line is when you cross the line between celebration into the realm of attack. The aforementioned placard crossed that line.</p>
<p>I have the freedom in this country to believe or NOT believe in anything I wish&#8230; that&#8217;s what makes us great. What I don&#8217;t get is why those who don&#8217;t, feel it is their mission to make sure others can&#8217;t. (same could be said for the aggressively religious folks too)</p>
<p>If I want to petition the Olympia government to erect a display to the holy flying spaghetti monster, I have the freedom to do so&#8230; but I wouldn&#8217;t be doing it in a way that would degrade other religious displays or trash them for their beliefs.</p>
<p>I wish everyone I talk to a Merry Christmas this time of year&#8230; I don&#8217;t stop and ponder what their beliefs may be and shockingly to some, I get the greeting sent right back by my Jewish friends and the Atheist ones alike. There&#8217;s simply no reason to be an ass because someone doesn&#8217;t share your view of the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god.</em>&#8221; - Thomas Jefferson</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ve heard by now that Barack Obama (Not President-Elect until 2 weeks from now) will be appointing Senator Hillary Clinton to replace Condoleeza Rice as Secretary of State. One problem&#8230; that pesky piece of paper we call the Constitution.</p>
<p>The second clause of Article 1, Section 6, of the Constitution states, &#8220;No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Hillary Clinton&#8217;s terms in the US Senate, the salary for Cabinet Officers, of which she will become, was increased from $186,600 to $191,300 and is set to increase again in January of 2009 when she is to take office.</p>
<p>Under Article 1, Section 6 of the US Constitution, THE Rule of Law in this country&#8230; Senator Clinton is ineligible for any Cabinet position under this administration.</p>
<p>This of course won&#8217;t stop Obama, nor has it apparently stopped several other administrations in the past. (isn&#8217;t it lovely when our own Presidents can&#8217;t follow the rules?) President Nixon appointed William B. Saxbe to the position of Attorney General, despite the Senate of which Saxbe was a member, all but doubling Cabinet pay. Taft, Carter and Bush Sr. have also run the razors edge on A1S6&#8230; will Obama do the same?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a section on the application to work for the Obama administration on his transition website, under a section labeled &#8216;Miscellaneous&#8217; the following question leaps out at you.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you or any members of your immediate family own a gun? If so, provide complete ownership and registration information. Has the registration ever lapsed? Please also describe how and by whom it is used and whether it has been the cause of any personal injuries or property damage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I really don&#8217;t like this question for a number of reasons&#8230; first, my ownership or use of a gun is a protected right under the US Constitution it should not be used as a basis to deny employment in any agency or business. If I have committed assault or a felony in any way with/without a firearm I would be perfectly fine with that being used as an excuse to pass me over, but simply asking if I exercise one of my rights as an American Citizen to rule me out doesn&#8217;t fly with me.</p>
<p>Republicans and even some Democrats are confused as to why the question was even included as it serves no REAL purpose in the application. The Obama transition team claim that the questions purpose is to help them determine something about &#8220;legal permitting&#8221; but even if this were true, would still have no real place on a job application. One thing to note is that this question was NOT on the application during the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Chris Cox from the NRA issued a statement about the applications gun question;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Barack Obama and his administration are showing their true colors and true philosophy with regard to the Second Amendment. It shows what we’ve been saying all along — this guy doesn’t view the Second Amendment as a fundamental constitutional right.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I think this makes Obama&#8217;s stance on guns clear, I don&#8217;t see this as a sign that he is actively seeking to ban guns all together&#8230; it&#8217;s just yet another red flag to be on the lookout for.</p>
