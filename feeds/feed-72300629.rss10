<em>[This cartoon I drew this morning pretty much sums it up...]</em></p>

<p>For the last six months or so, I've been trying to get my head around Dell. Trying to see what they're good at, what they're not so good at, and seeing if there's a way that maybe, just maybe, I could help them in some small way become a better company.</p>

<p>But it's been a somewhat arduous process. Progress has been slow. Not because anyone's done anything wrong- on their side or mine- it's just a big nut I'm trying to crack here. Rome wasn't built in a day.</p>

<p>Today I had a bit of an EUREKA! moment. </p>

<p>I like Dell. They are good friends of mine. They've been good clients to me. Big Kudos all round. They have a lot of good qualities. For example:<blockquote>They're very good at being efficient.<br />
They are very nice people, for the most part.<br />
They have a very tenacious streak to them.<br />
They seem to frown on what they consider to be needless extravagance. They're frugal.<br />
They're very practically minded. They like numbers, they don't like getting too excited about all this airy-fairy, new-age marketing pixie dust.<br />
They are driven to constantly create great products.<br />
They are driven to constantly create a better company and culture. They figure that if they don't keep raising the bar, somebody else will do it for them.</blockquote>Nothing I have seen there with my own two eyes would lead me to believe otherwise. All well and good. </p>

<p><strong>But one word I'm going to keep of the list: "Creative".</strong></p>

<p>Of course Dell has tons of creative people working for them. Of course they're always "creating" great stuff. Of course there's huge reservoirs of creative capital, teeming away in those large glass building of theirs.</p>

<p><strong>But if I randomly asked you to make a list of the world's top ten most "Creative" companies, would Dell make it on to the list? I'm guessing, for most people reading this, they simply wouldn't.</strong></p>

<p>Yes. I happen think this is a SERIOUSLY huge problem.</p>

<p>What needs to happen for Dell to be a more "Creative" company? What would need to change in order to get Dell onto that Top Ten List? What EXACTLY is involved?</p>

<p>The good news is, this is a huge opportunity. For both Dell, myself, and anybody else who actually cares about this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Man, I'm excited now. Rock on.<br><br><br />

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="stupid3333.jpg" src="http://www.gapingvoid.com/stupid3333.jpg" width="400" height="230" /></p>

<p>1. Sometime in the next few weeks I shall be releasing my first big, proper edition of signed, fine-art lithographs.</p>

<p>2. These will not be sponsored "social objects" from <a href="http://Stormhoek.com">Stormhoek</a>, Microsoft or whatever. These will be for sale. Cash. Moolah. Via this blog. No galleries.</p>

<p>3. They will be high quality. Very high quality.</p>

<p>4. I plan on using color for the first one, maybe black and white in the future- though I haven't really thought that far ahead yet.</p>

<p>5. It'll be an edition of 85 prints. I'm not planning on selling them all. I want to hold on to some of them, for posterity's sake.</p>

<p>6. They'll all be signed and numbered by hand, by me.</p>

<p>7. I plan to be blogging a lot about the whole process in the next few weeks. As with any new adventure, a lot of stuff still needs to be figured out long-term- I hope by talking about it with everybody, it'll help me make better artistic decisions.</p>

<p>8. Though my work covers a lot of different themes and emotional states, for this first one I'll be focusing more on the business-culture, <a href="http://Hughtrain.com">Hughtrain</a> sensibility. I want the print to be the kind of thing you'd want to hang up in your office.</p>

<p>9. This is not some groovy little side project for me. This enterprise is going to be a major part of my life over the next few years. Just letting you know.</p>

<p>10. We'll be printing them up in mid-January. If you want to get in early, I'm going to make 20 prints available; you can pre-order one before the printing date for $175. <a href="mailto:gapingvoid@gmail.com">Just ping me an e-mail</a>. After they are printed the price goes up, to around the $250-300 range. </p>

<p>11. Thanks Again.</p>

<p>[Update:] Just got back from dinner. Tired. So far I have 24 requests for the 20 pre-orders. Looks like I may have to disappoint 4 people. Long day. Going to bed. Will talk in the morning. Thanks, Everybody!<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>[<a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004049.html">The Techcrunch Party print</a> from 2007.]</em></p>

<p>I've been spending a lot of time this week, researching and talking to fine art print shops. <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004693.html">Like I said a few weeks ago</a>, I'm planning to spend more time in the print business.</p>

<p>This development has been a long time coming. In the last twenty years, I've drawn thousands of cartoons and shared them with tens of thousands of people, which has slowly built up what I believe to be a reasonably-sized commercial market for my work. </p>

<p>Besides that, I've been living in the West Texas desert for over nine months, and I'm finding drawing cartoons is far more aligned to that way of life, than being an "internet marketing guy" or whatever. Like a painter friend of mine told me the other week, "There's not much to do out here, except make art and drink beer."</p>

<p>Being a full-time cartoonist is still not something I ever plan on doing, but life has been pulling me more and more in that direction for a while, almost against my will. Maybe one day I'll get tired of resisting it, who knows?</p>

<p>Wish me luck, anyway...<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://herd.typepad.com">Mark Earls</a> says the future of advertising is not in messages.

<p><em>[Cartoon inspired by <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2008/11/open-letter-to.html">Shel Israel's recent post</a>]</em><br />
<strong><u><br />
[UPDATE:] Brian Rethinks Dell</u></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/bb">Brian Baily</a>, who follows me on Twitter, emailed me the following re. my work with Dell. Got my attention, to say the least:<blockquote>The thing I keep trying to figure out is why did a few 140-character comments by a guy I had never met have more impact on my view of Dell than anything else over the last 2 years. I used to love Dell and worked with them all the time in my former life. Over the last few years, I began to see them as a big, soulless company obsessed with only the product and its price (and especially the price of all the pieces that make the product). All of their advertising seems to be about the stuff and the specs and not about me, or my company, or the amazing things I can do with their it. Even if they want to emphasize their price advantage, which is important, tell me that how I can afford a better health plan for my employees because I'm not wasting money on overpriced hardware.</p>

<p>Your few tweets and posts about Dell have already made me think about Dell differently. I've heard a little about the determined, loyal people inside who want Dell to build the best products for the best price. I have a sense of the soul inside the machine, and their passion to do what they do better than anyone else, but also to do well by their customers. Dell seems like a company worth paying attention to again. Hell, I even looked up the Dell Mini - the first time I've been on a Dell product page in a long time (unfortunately their web stuff and product naming still sucks and is ridiculously complicated... "Dell Inspiron Mini 9"). As a Texan, I want Dell to thrive. I hope you can play a part in making that happen.</blockquote>I've been saying this for years: Blogging [and all its social media cousins] is a good way to make things happen <em>indirectly.</em> Sure, it takes forever and it's a bitch to measure, but when it works... Boy, it REALLY works.<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>
