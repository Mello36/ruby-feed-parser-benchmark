			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my copious spare time, I&#8217;ve been reading <a href='http://mises.org/books/Theory_Money_Credit/Contents.aspx'>The Theory of Money and Credit</a> by Ludwig von Mises. The book was written in 1912, but it feels like it was written in an alternate universe where only gold and silver are really money and the slips of paper we accept nowadays are a simple fraud. Fascinating.</p>
<p>(When I was a teenager I devoured just about everything by Mises, but perhaps it&#8217;s time to bone up on economics again&#8230;)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Christmas songs are a bit spooky. I&#8217;m thinking especially of &#8220;Santa Claus Is Comin&#8217; To Town&#8221;, which makes that merry old elf out to be almost Orwellian. Since I like to write alternate lyrics to songs, I made the following adaptation of &#8220;Santa Claus Is Comin&#8217; To Town&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better watch out, you&#8217;d better not cry<br />
You&#8217;d better not pout, I&#8217;m telling you why<br />
Santa Claus is comin&#8217; to town!</p>
<p>He&#8217;s making a list, he&#8217;s checking it twice<br />
His database says who&#8217;s naughty or nice<br />
Santa Claus is comin&#8217; to town!</p>
<p>He spies on you in the night-time<br />
He spies on you in the day<br />
He keeps track of all your movements<br />
He works for the CIA</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better watch out, you&#8217;d better not cry<br />
You&#8217;d better not pout, I&#8217;m telling you why<br />
Santa Claus is comin&#8217; to town!</p>
<p>The kids in Girl and Boy Land<br />
They never will be free<br />
They&#8217;re in the Santa Youth League<br />
They&#8217;ll conform like you and me</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better watch out, you&#8217;d better not cry<br />
You&#8217;d better not pout, I&#8217;m telling you why<br />
Santa Claus is comin&#8217; to town!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the original bailout of the financial industry back in October, the U.S. Congress made a show of voting it down, supposedly in response to the overwhelming opposition of the citizenry, then passed it anyway (after allowing favored politicians in close re-election races an opportunity to vote &#8220;no&#8221; the first time). I predict that the same thing will happen with the bailout of the American auto manufacturers: the Congress told the corporate welfare kings from Detroit to take a hike a few weeks back, but today I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll say &#8220;oh you came back with a wonderful plan, here&#8217;s 50 billion dollars&#8221; (or whatever).</p>
<p>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.</p>

I try to have big ears, but I must say that I&#8217;m not particularly fond of the flute or most woodwinds (except perhaps the oboe). And I really don&#8217;t like the triangle.

The same goes for some of the symphonic poems of Anton&#237;n Dvo&#345;&#225;k.</p>
<p>Just my musical pet peeve of the day&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While other folks were voting or not voting yesterday, I was <a href='https://stpeter.im/?p=2213'>unvoting</a>. (In fact I voted on the initiatives and referenda, but I unvoted on all those who would claim to <em>represent</em> me.) Here&#8217;s the top of my ballot to provide some context:</p>
<p><img src='/images/consent-cover.png'/></p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a quote from Abraham Lincoln, in red ink just in case someone was going to gloss over it:</p>
<p><img src='/images/consent-quote.png'/></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s how I voted for those who would claim to be my representatives:</p>
<p><img src='/images/consent-withdrawn.png'/></p>
<p>So I am officially on record (at my blog if nowhere else) as having withdrawn my consent from the federal government in the District of Columbia, the state government in Colorado, and the local government in Denver. If &#8220;silence gives consent&#8221; (as Oliver Goldsmith once wrote), then let my voice be heard loud and clear by these various governments: I am a sovereign individual and your presidents, senators, congresspeople, and other functionaries do not represent me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Marcoullier of <a href='http://gnipcentral.com/'>Gnip</a> recently <a href='http://blog.gnipcentral.com/2008/11/03/winding-down-xmpp-for-now/'>announced</a> that they were winding down their XMPP support. Both <a href='http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/gnip_says_xmpp_ecosytem_too_ha.php'>Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> and <a href='http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2008/11/gnip-dropping-x.html'>Stowe Boyd</a> found this surprising, given that Gnip&#8217;s customers seem to be crying for the real-time data that an XMPP firehose would provide (and despite the fact that services like Yahoo Fire Eagle are busy <a href='http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/gnip_says_xmpp_ecosytem_too_ha.php#comment-115822'>ramping up</a> their XMPP support).</p>
<p>I find Eric&#8217;s reasoning to be a bit flawed. First he says that the XMPP ecosystem is immature because there are too many XMPP server implementations, in contrast to the simpler world of HTTP servers where <a href='http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html'>Apache dominates</a>. Yet the email ecosystem is quite mature and has <a href='http://www.mailradar.com/mailstat/'>no one dominant server implementation</a> (the current stats at mailradar.com are Sendmail 24%, Postfix 20%, qmail 17%, Microsoft Mail 15%, and exim 13%).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that there are <a href='http://xmpp.org/software/servers.shtml'>quite a few XMPP server implementations</a>, but only about half a dozen of them are serious players and some <a href='http://www.process-one.net/en/imtrends/article/usage_estimation_of_public_xmpp_servers_per_domain/'>rough estimates of deployment</a> indicate that there is no one dominant implementation (not very different from the email landscape). Furthermore, there is strong interoperability between these implementations because we run an open and growing network of servers and most people are happily unaware of which implementation is running at any particular domain.</p>
<p>A bit further along in Eric&#8217;s post, we learn why they are experiencing problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Gnip’s perspective, XMPP is causing us pain and eating cycles.  More than half of all customer service requests are about XMPP and in many cases, the receiving party isn’t standing up their own server.  They’re running off of Google or Jabber.org and there’s not much we can do when they get throttled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here&#8217;s the problem: it&#8217;s not that the XMPP ecosystem is immature, it&#8217;s that Gnip&#8217;s customers are immature. They are attempting to run high-throughput data services via end-user accounts or bots running at open IM services like Google Talk and jabber.org. Then they are surprised when their accounts get rate-limited for excessive usage! The solution is for them to run their own XMPP servers. As mentioned there are plenty of such servers to choose from, and you can have most of them up and running in a few minutes.</p>
<p>My conclusion: diversity and maturity can go hand-in-hand, but you need to choose the right tool for the job.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It strikes me more and more that politics is a kind of modern-day religion. Too many people seem to believe that government can solve all problems through some magical power of centralized coercion. Yet what evidence do we have that those in power truly care about solving the problems of the people? Sure, they <em>say</em> they care, but as far as I can see that&#8217;s just talk so they can get elected and promptly ignore the people. Over two thousand years ago, Epicurus observed about the gods of the Greeks and Romans that &#8220;if they exist, they don&#8217;t concern themselves with us&#8221;. Today&#8217;s politicians are just as poorly behaved as the Olympian gods of old, and they too concern themselves mostly with maintaining and exercising their own power. But I suppose that likening politicians to the gods of Epicurus is just a fancy way of restating the fundamental truths of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice_theory'>public choice theory</a>&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October 14, 2008. Remember that date.</p>
<p>Today is the day that the nine largest banks in America were told &#8212; not asked, but told &#8212; that the Federal Government would be buying significant stakes in their companies. Mark Landler and Eric Dash of the New York Times <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/business/economy/15bailout.html'>report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chief executives of the nine largest banks in the United States trooped into a gilded conference room at the Treasury Department at 3 p.m. Monday. To their astonishment, they were each handed a one-page document that said they agreed to sell shares to the government, then Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said they must sign it before they left&#8230;.</p>
<p>[B]y 6:30, all nine chief executives had signed — setting in motion the largest government intervention in the American banking system since the Depression and retreating from the rescue plan Mr. Paulson had fought so hard to get through Congress only two weeks earlier&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a take it or take it offer,&#8221; said one person who was briefed on the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. &#8220;Everyone knew there was only one answer.&#8221; &#8230;.</p>
<p>The executives did not have an inkling of Mr. Paulson’s plans. Some speculated that he would brief them about the government’s latest bailout program, or perhaps sound them out about a voluntary initiative. No one expected him to present his plan as an ultimatum&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve always said to everyone that ever worked for me, if you get too dug in on a position, the facts change, and you don’t change to adapt to the facts, you will never be successful,&#8221; [Mr. Paulson] said&#8230;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, my friends, is fascism, straight out of the playbook of Benito Mussolini.</p>
<p>Never forget that he who pays the piper calls the tune. Now the Federal Government will, in subtle or not-so-subtle ways, control who does and does not get a loan, a mortgage, and credit of any kind.</p>
<p>Can you doubt that there will be a &#8220;no-loan list&#8221; to match the &#8220;no-fly list&#8221;? After all, we can&#8217;t be giving credit to terrorists!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Businessman, but Mr. Paulson didn&#8217;t like what you said about his boss last week, so you won&#8217;t be able to expand your company. We are reserving credit for corporations that are, shall we say, more cooperative. We all need to pull together in these tough times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;d like to buy that house, Bob, but your mortgage loan has been denied. No, I don&#8217;t know why, but if I were you I&#8217;d be a bit more careful about those letters to the editor. Maybe come back in a few months after you&#8217;ve had a change of heart and we&#8217;ll see what we can do, OK?&#8221;</p>
<p>The recent bailouts, loan guarantees, and so on now total an inconceivable $2.25 trillion dollars, with no end in sight (we must be flexible and react to whatever new &#8220;facts&#8221; arise &#8212; action above all, as the fascists used to say). But all that money is only part of the price. The even greater cost is the tremendous concentration of power in the person of the Secretary of the Treasury. So let us recall a wise observation by the great British liberal <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Acton#Famous_sayings_of_Lord_Acton'>Lord Acton</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control. History has proven that. All power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Treasury boys are gangsters, or awfully close to it. No discussion, no public hearings, no open airing of the issues &#8212; just raw power exercised through an ultimatum and the implicit threat of force.</p>
<p>Where are the great voices for freedom and simple human dignity, raised against this government-financial complex, this absolute corruption of the American body politic, animated as it is by a twisted sort of trickle-down economics? They are nowhere to be heard.</p>
<p>Indeed it appears, sadly, that the great voices for freedom and dignity are gone. Those are such old-fashioned values. We need to be modern and flexible; we need to focus on action and unity above all; we need, in short, to be fascists.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t cry for us, Mussolini. The truth is we never have left you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href='http://www.fsf.org/'>Free Software Foundation</a> has added the following to its <a href='http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html'>high priority list</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free software replacement for Skype</p>
<p>Skype is a proprietary Voice-over-IP program that uses a proprietary protocol. Skype is seducing free software users into using proprietary software, often two users at a time. We do not want to encourage the creation of a Skype compatible client, but instead, we want to encourage you to create, contribute to, or promote the use of free software alternatives to Skype, such as Ekiga, and to encourage to adoption and use of free VoIP, video, and chat protocols such as SIP and XMPP/Jingle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, maybe <a href='http://www.michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=275'>this is why</a>?</p>
<p>In the XMPP community we&#8217;ve been making quite a bit of progress lately on <a href='http://xmpp.org/tech/jingle.shtml'>Jingle</a>, so I&#8217;m looking forward to building open replacements for black-box technologies like Skype.</p>
<p>Open is better.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend <a href='http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/notablog/'>Chris Sciabarra</a> has written a <a href='http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/notablog/archives/001540.html'>fundamental analysis</a> of the bailout, in which he elucidates the deeply systemic nature of the problems facing American finance, politics, and economics. He concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t does not matter one iota who gets elected President. The emphases might vary slightly under Obama or McCain, but the fundamentals of U.S. political economy, and, I should add, U.S. foreign policy, will not change. Indeed, even for those of us who view the current Bush administration as the worst in our history, well, certainly the worst in our lifetime&#8230;. it is clear that nothing proposed by Obama or McCain is going to change the structural defects of this system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really do think that the best one can do now is to withdraw consent rather than to vote for any of the offered &#8220;alternatives&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I just quoted, the Declaration of Independence states &#8220;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed&#8221;. I observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments are instituted (they are not natural).</li>
<li>The purpose of that instituting is to secure natural, inalienable rights.</li>
<li>Governments can have just powers and, presumably, unjust powers.</li>
<li>The just powers of governments are granted through the consent of the governed.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these principles, classical liberals tend to draw several conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unjust powers of governments are not and cannot be granted through the consent of the governed (they are powers taken, not powers granted).</li>
<li>Any powers beyond securing natural, inalienable rights are unjust.</li>
<li>Governments can be just if all they do is secure natural, inalienable rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those of a more deeply individualist persuasion might go even farther:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments cannot be instituted among &#8220;the governed&#8221; because human beings are naturally sovereign; only to the extent that people are ungoverned can they freely choose to give their consent to any agreement (including especially the agreement to institute a government).</li>
<li>Throughout history, governments have never been instituted solely or even primarily to secure the natural, inalienable rights of the individual.</li>
<li>At any time you have the right to withdraw your consent from any government, even if some part of its activities is devoted to securing individual rights.</li>
<li>After you have withdrawn your consent, you cannot legitimately be governed because, as Lincoln said, &#8220;No man is good enough to govern another man without that other&#8217;s consent.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time I find myself trending farther away from the classical liberal position and closer to the individualist position. What that implies for my political views is not something I&#8217;ve settled on yet&#8230;</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Declaration of Independence, it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such thinking sounds positively seditious today, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over at OpenMarket.org, Iain Murray <a href='http://www.openmarket.org/2008/10/03/bash-the-bailout-government-is-not-the-answer/'>observes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bailout bill is now law, but it does little or nothing to solve the problems government created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forgive me, Mr. Murray, but I shall now use your statement as reason to mount a hobbyhorse of my own: the difference between law and legislation.</p>
<p>To my old-fashioned (or perhaps scientific) mind, a law is something natural: Newton&#8217;s law of universal gravitation, the law of conservation of energy, Gresham&#8217;s law, Say&#8217;s Law, Boyle&#8217;s law &#8212; you get the picture.</p>
<p>By contrast, legislation is something man-made, something imposed, something unnatural, something that those in power attempt to dictate through fiat, command, decree, proclamation, edict, ukase, mandate, or some other form of coercion. The word &#8220;legislation&#8221; means at root &#8220;the enactment of a law&#8221;, &#8220;the making of a law&#8221; &#8212; in other words, asserting that something man-made has the force of something natural.</p>
<p>Call me recalcitrant, but I prefer to say that Congresscritters and other such imposters promulgate legislation, not laws.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As America slides ever closer to political <a href='http://ismbook.com/absolutism.html'>absolutism</a>, I find myself ever more attracted to musical absolutism. For many years now some of my favorite pieces of music have been Bach&#8217;s more absolute works, such as the Art of the Fugue, the Keyboard Partitas, and the Cello Suites. Lately also I&#8217;ve been listening a lot to the 24 preludes and fugues by Dmitri Shostakovich (as recorded by Keith Jarrett). I&#8217;ve also just discovered the music of German bassist-composer Eberhard Weber, which I look forward to exploring more fully in the coming months. To me, there is something deeply calming about such absolute music &#8212; no lyrics, no program, no flash, no bombast, just pure, unadorned musical thinking.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Doc Searls and his son Allen have been talking about the <a href='http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/09/26/the-live-web/'>live web</a>. Sadly, one of the most dynamic corners of the &#8216;net &#8212; the real-time developer community centered around jabber.org &#8212; has been old and static (at least when it comes to the web). That&#8217;s about to change. Today in the <a href='http://speeqe.com/room/webteam@conference.jabber.org/'>webteam</a> chatroom we had a <a href='http://logs.jabber.org/webteam@conference.jabber.org/2008-10-02.html#14:50:26'>lively discussion</a> (pardon the pun) about how to enliven the jabber.org web experience. Expect a radically dynamic new interface soon, with live chatrooms powered by <a href='http://speeqe.com/'>speeqe</a>, microblogging feeds, and just a few static pages for reference purposes. The design is still emerging, but I really like the ideas we&#8217;re working to make real. Join the conversation!</p>
