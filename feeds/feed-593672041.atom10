<![CDATA[<p>Huddle.net launches charitable donation programme through Charity Technology Exchange </p>

	<p>Charity Technology Trust has announced today the launch of the Huddle.net  donation programme through Charity Technology Exchange (<span class="caps">CTX</span>)</p>

	<p>Huddle is a new concept in web software combining intranet, extranet, document sharing, online office, collaboration and project management tools in a simple to use, secure online service. Eligible organisations registered with <span class="caps">CTX</span> can now request the donation of a Huddle Plus account with 10 workspaces, 10GB of storage and unlimited users.</p>

	<p>With Huddle, organisations can build a ‘virtual charity’: connect head office to remote offices, stakeholders or volunteers working from home. They can store and share documents securely, brainstorm ideas with everyone and manage multiple projects from one place. Huddle is hosted online, so there’s no software to download, and can be accessed securely from any computer with an internet connection.</p>

	<p>“Huddle.net has been committed to giving charities free access to its technology since its inception. We have already helped a number of charities take advantage of the opportunities that online collaboration brings to their organisations. By teaming up with <span class="caps">CTX</span> we can extend the reach of Huddle to many more charities across the UK,” said Alastair Mitchell, co-founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span>.</p>

	<p>William Hoyle, <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Charity Technology Trust commented, “Adding Huddle to our growing list of partners who donate their technology through <span class="caps">CTX</span> is particularly exciting for us. Web 2.0 and web based collaboration software in particular, holds the promise of helping charities deliver on their missions more effectively and in new and innovative ways. Huddle’s commitment to helping charities access this technology has the potential to have a major impact on the sector.”</p>

	<p>Charities already using Huddle include <span class="caps">UNICEF</span>, Swiss Red Cross, World Vision and MS Society. <br />
As a part of the Huddle donation programme through <span class="caps">CTX</span>, the first 20 qualifying organisations that request a donation will be offered a free place at a Huddle Masterclass. The Masterclass will look at how charities can exploit the potential of online collaboration and virtual working in an interactive session with experts from Huddle. It will be held in London on the 26th January 2009.</p>

	<p>- ends &#8211; </p>

	<p>About Charity Technology Exchange<br />

Since 2006 over 2,000 charities have benefited from the programme in the UK. The <span class="caps">CTX</span> programme is delivered by Charity Technology Trust in partnership with the San Francisco-based nonprofit technology capacity building organisation TechSoup. </p>

<item><title>Huddle.net named in 2008 Magic Quadrant for Social Software</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>Huddle.net has been named in the Niche Players quadrant in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Social Software. </p>

	<p>“In my opinion, it’s a great coup for Huddle to be named in the Magic Quadrant,” said Alastair Mitchell, co-founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span>. “We may be a young company, but we’ve got a solid business model and buoyant sales. We are constantly looking to make our product better, deliver it in more territories and build its application into more social networks.”</p>

	<p>Huddle.net combines unified collaboration with social networking. Its Huddle platform offers simple and secure project management, collaboration and document sharing for more effective working inside and outside the enterprise.</p>

	<p>All companies included in The Social Software Magic Quadrant were evaluated against Gartner’s evaluation criteria. These included: ability to execute (product and business viability, sales execution, market responsiveness and track record, marketing execution, customer experience and operations) and completeness of vision (market understanding, market strategy, sales and product strategy, business model, industry and geographic strategy and innovation). </p>

<![CDATA[<p><strong>LinkedIn users get team collaboration app from Huddle</strong></p>

	<p>London, 30 October, 2008 &#8211; Huddle.net has today revealed the first team collaboration and project management application for the LinkedIn business social network. <br />
For LinkedIn’s platform launch, Huddle.net developed a bespoke Huddle application &#8211; Huddle Workspaces &#8211; which includes all the key functionality of its popular unified collaboration service.</p>

	<p>Huddle Workspaces offers private online workspaces for secure team collaboration, document sharing and discussions within the LinkedIn network. Users receive 1Gb of free storage and can collaborate with unlimited connections.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Every professional has a need to collaborate, and what better way to get stuff done than in an environment you trust and with the people you trust – your LinkedIn connections,&#8221; said Andy McLoughlin, co-founder and product director, Huddle.net.</p>

	<p>Huddle is keen to kill off email as a collaboration tool. With ‘discussions,’ users can brainstorm ideas and quickly exchange useful pieces of information while banishing confusing ‘reply-all’ email threads.</p>

	<p>Advanced document management tools mean that users can share any type of files and create &amp; edit documents online in .doc and .xls format. They can post comments on files, request approvals and send notifications. Documents can be also locked and checked out of the system for offline editing.</p>

	<p>There is no download or install required. Users simply log into LinkedIn and can immediately set up workspaces for use with their LinkedIn connections. All activity in a workspace is recorded and can be delivered via an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed.</p>

	<p>By linking their accounts, LinkedIn users can connect with people and share content in the wider Huddle network (my.huddle.net) and other networks where Huddle is available, i.e. Facebook. They also gain access to additional features including: tasks, whiteboards, audit trails, version control, multi-lingual interface and soon, desktop sharing and web conferencing. </p>

	<p>Andy continued: &#8220;Being a part of LinkedIn’s prestigious platform launch marks an exciting new chapter in our two-year history. It’s a testament to the quality of our tools, our staff’s hard work, our users’ loyalty and the company’s fast growth.&#8221;</p>

<item><title>Government should buy local, go social, public sector workers say</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p><em>Mini-revolt over falling behind with innovation</em></p>

	<p>IT is no different than food, reckon public sector workers, encouraging the Government to buy local and organic to avert past IT disasters, the Social Collaboration and Public Sector study by Huddle.net revealed today.</p>

	<p>Most respondents (84%) want to be harsher with IT providers who fail to deliver. They believe that setting project budgets that cannot be deviated from could partially solve the issue. Some respondents commented: ‘if the IT doesn’t work, we simply won’t pay for it.’</p>

	<p>One third (32.5%) believe the Government’s IT problems could be solved by buying from local, UK-based companies rather than multi-national conglomerates. Respondents to the study encouraged purchasing departments to ‘get better advice before buying’ and ‘not to buy for buying’s sake.’</p>

	<p>In addition, more than half of public sector workers (52%) are disappointed with lack of innovation in IT services.</p>

	<p>Government IT projects have traditionally been plagued with inefficiencies and overspend, with the latter reported at £2 billion in early April this year*. The study results further support the recent Enterprise Strategy and Budget 2008, which is looking to help more small to medium-sized enterprises (<span class="caps">SME</span>s) win public sector contracts. The goal is to ensure that <span class="caps">SME</span>s win 30 per cent of all public sector contracts.</p>

	<p>“In our experience public sector workers are already leading their private sector counterparts in adopting new technologies &#8211; but there is obvious demand to go a lot further,” said Alastair Mitchell, co-founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span> at Huddle.net, the social collaboration firm that enables employees to work together both inside and outside their organisations.</p>

	<p>“Why buy from a supermarket when fresh produce from local farmers is cheaper and delivered to your door on the hour?” he asked. “There’s enough technology acumen amongst homegrown companies in this country to make a real difference to the Government’s ailing IT.”</p>

	<p>In Huddle’s study, public sector workers admitted struggling with existing IT infrastructure. Eighty per cent claimed they received too many emails, while almost a third (26%) could not access information they required to perform their job. A few respondents confessed the majority of their tasks still comprise of managing paper, letters and memos.</p>

	<p>Despite social networks such as Facebook banned in more than half of respondents’ organisations (56%), public sector workers are eager to take advantage of it in the workplace. A third (31%) would like to set up a social network for their own local organisation, while 38 per cent would support a government-wide social network.</p>

	<p>“IT departments hear ‘Facebook’ and clam up. But there’s more to social networking than just consumer sites. Public sector workers already know that efficiencies can be made with using collaborative technologies for work, so it’s time that IT heads caught up,” Mitchell said.</p>

	<p>The study also highlighted that the Government fails to lead by example in reducing its carbon footprint. Only 15 per cent of respondents believe the Government is doing enough to curb it. Extensive travel to meetings (16%) and slow take-up of video-conferencing (14%) may play a role.</p>

	<p>The Social Collaboration in Public Sector study was carried out amongst 202 local authority officials, between 16 and 23 July 2008.</p>
