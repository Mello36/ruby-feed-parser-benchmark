			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we have done the last several years, the teens will be doing the Angel Tag Toy Drive. We have 20 tags and each one has the name of a boy or girl with their age and what they would like for Christmas. These are families in OC who have very little and often, this is the only gift they receive for Christmas. I wanted to see who would like to take a tag this Tue/Wed at midweek? If each family or married teen leader couple takes just one tag, would could easily take care of all of them. We&#8217;re a little behind b/c of our trip this past week. Thanks so much.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The OC Teen Party on Saturday Nov 8th will be at the Lennox&#8217; home in Orange. I will send out more details this week. Please plan on bring something. I&#8217;ll let you know in the next couple of days</p>
<p>2701 E. Collins Ave, Orange CA 92867. Parking will be on the street. We were thinking depending on what you would like, that the garage can be a game room, the living room video game room, and the front room can be a moving room. Or something like that. People will also be able to hang outside, or in the dining room. Looking forward to this Saturday.</p>
