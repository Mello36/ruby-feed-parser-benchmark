			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mumbai Witnessed the worst Terror Attacks ever inflicted on India. It took 2 days and three nights to flush out the terrorists from their hideouts and end the 60 hour long ordeal. We lost around 180 precious lives and more than 300 were injured. Over 20 of our brave soldiers laid their lives for the cause. Whole of India got affected. In the coming 1 year, a lot of things will change. Two biggest five star hotels of Maharashtra were destroyed beyond recognition. It may take 1 year for the hotels to regain their glory. But when will India regain its pride? When will India really bounce back? Do we have answers to it?</p>
<p>In the last 3 or 4 days, we have saw a flurry of resignations and more to come in our political cirlces. But will they help? Do the replacements which are now sought for these left out posts work efficiently to bring back faith to our democracy? Whole of the world condemned the attacks but if Maharashtra&#8217;s Deputy CM did not wanted to take it seriously, what help are those condemnations for? The Resignations were not made to show their responsibility but to run away from their responsibility. If they really felt responsible, instead of resigning they should have assured the nation and took a pledge that this will never be repeated and should have taken concrete steps to ensure this does not happen again. And the terrorist who was caught should be hanged along with the terrorist who is still facing jail term for attacking Indian parliament on Dec, 2001.</p>
<p>Voting is simply not going to help because our votes have stopped mattering to the government. Though they are of different political parties, their aim is single: to divide country, earn money and never let a honest person take the chair. And they have time and again succeeded in achieving these goals. We as a citizen have to raise our voices, go against our governments and not let our voices cool down. Stop liseting, start speaking. Act before this incident cools down in the minds of our goverment servants otherwise it will be too late before next attack is launched on India.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://navjotspeaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/real-business.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-35" style="margin: 5px;" title="Politics or Business?" src="http://navjotspeaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/real-business.jpg" alt="Politics or Business?" width="340" height="235" /></a>As you know, elections are nearing &#8230; gosh this Saturday only. So have you decided for whom will you vote this time? Maybe or maybe not. Do you know which candidate thinks better for you? Do you want to correct the mistake you did in last elections? Or are you even aware that elections are coming soon?</p>
<p>Well if you ask me, I have decided whom I will vote for. I will vote for equality of status, liberal thinking, secularism, economic growth, low inflation, Zero Corruption, Good Infrastructure, Job Security, Education for all, No Poverty and lots of other burning issues. But now the problem comes. From what he have witnessed for so many years now, no single party is delivered fully. Leave fully, they have not done anything seriously. All was done to impress the voters. None of the issues have been solved completely. And its not that these issues take 61.5 years to solve? I don&#8217;t think voting has made any difference. Problem lies is that everybody is corrupt from top to bottom. We indulge in corruption from fear from above. Peoples above us are in fear from their seniors. And this goes on till the top level where corruption has started. Unless, complete Political system of India is routed out and a fresh new recruitment of Politicans who are educated, unbiased, young and dynamic, I won&#8217;t vote. And therefore, I may not vote till I am alive. Because I don&#8217;t think, ground situation will ever change. If it was not enough with Secularism issues that Region based divides have started. One problem starts diminishing and other is ready to take place. The only place is that we stand against this rule not with this rule by voting them.</p>
<p>My Big Suggestion, If complete India votes for nobody..I mean Zero Votes&#8230;.then we will see what these Politicans can do. This is the only way all corrupt politicans and rulers can be overthrown. Voting has only meaning&#8230;choosing one corrupt out of many. Nobody listens to the public. We are merely puppets who are ordered to vote so that one can eat by sitting as the ruler and other as the opponent.</p>
<p>God Save India from these!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t misread my statement. Its a old news that Paypal started supporting withdrawl to Indian banks. But now I found not only the earlier 10 banks listed but now Paypal supports withdrawl to any Indian bank. So no need to get a new bank account to withdraw your paypal money. I don&#8217;t know when did the Paypal made this change but when I logged into my Paypal today, I was surprised to see no dropdown box for those 10 banks. I felt strange and then I came upon <a href="http://pages.ebay.in/paypal_bankaccount/" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Here is quote from above page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which bank can I use to withdraw my money?<br />
You can now withdraw your money to any of the NEFT enabled banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a screenshot showing this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Add any Indian Bank Account to Paypal" src="http://pics.ebaystatic.com/aw/pics/in/globalTrade/add_step2_new.gif" alt="" width="450" height="378" /></p>
<p>I hope that Paypal continues to give Indians more importance and I would definitely like to see the facility to add funds to Paypal account from Indian Bank accounts also.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today,  read a <a href="http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/nov/16bigg-boss-finalists-in-failed-breakout-atte.htm" target="_blank">news on Rediff</a> saying that Big Boss Contestants were trying to break out of the House in a desparate attempt to have dinner outside. Of the four contestants left in the house, only Zulfi can cook and he probably refused to cook. And so in order to have dinner outside, they tried to break out of the house by climbing the walls but were caught by guards who escorted them back to the house.</p>
<p>Seems stupid? Well on the face of it, it seems more of a publicity stunt. Currently Endemol has denied this. Because if its not, then all four may lose any fees they got for being in the programme. And I don&#8217;t think these four were all sudden stupid to forget this. Others say it may be a part of task given by the Boss. Well for that, we may have to watch the 17 November&#8217;s episode. So &#8230; now since this news is out, most people who were finding it the stupidest show of millenium will stay glued to check the reality. A Nice TRP Boost because loosing money is worse and getting TRP is feasible here. So let&#8217;s wait and watch for the reality and the announcement on what&#8217;s the outcome of this breakout?</p>
<p>When will these cheap publicity stunts stop? Nobody on the Bigg Boss list was a famous personality and neither became famous after featuring in it. Last season winner Rahul Roy is still missing. And that&#8217;s good for us. <img src='http://navjotspeaks.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, a small girl from our locality was celebrating her birthday. Since our house was just a few steps from them, we were specially invited by their family. We didn&#8217;t expected this and were not prepared. At last moment, my sister went out and brought a small gift for her. It was priced at Rs 150. I remarked then that there is no need to hide the price of the gift&#8230;it gives a impression that we have spend considerable amount on gifting somebody. Then it came to my mind, do you consider hiding the gift&#8217;s cost or not?</p>
<p>What is your opinion here? Question may sound stupid but both hiding and not hiding the gift costs has its advantages. And both should be done according to the situation. If the person you are gifting is not liked by you, don&#8217;t hide the cost just to show that how much you have spend on him/her. And if that person is close to you, do hide the costs.</p>
<p>Now the point is that every gift costs money so what&#8217;s the point in hiding the costs practically? Everybody knows the approx. price of what all items are available. Recently in Diwali, one of my relative gave us a gold coin weghing 5gm. Now though there is no cost mentioned, what does this mean? Since they are close to us, so should they not have given the gift even if they wanted too. (Okay..nobody minds gold coins as gifts.) I think if you take it practically, no matter what&#8217;s the situation, there is no point in hiding the gift costs and spending time on rubbing/scratching cost sticker. Be Practical and be confident. Don&#8217;t shy from a small or big gift. Fact is that you did care to bring a gift for the concerned person. This only matters a lot. So don&#8217;t be materialistic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have used Youtube to watch online videos and most of us have also used any one of millions of hacks to download videos from youtube. I am not talking of them. Till now I thought that there is only one version of video available from Youtube and that is flv version which can be played in either VLC Media Player or any other dedicated flv player.</p>
<p>Today only I was researching for a online script for my bollywood videos site project and then I stumbled upon a script and to my surprise, Yotube creates atleast 3 versions of each video being uploaded to it. These three versions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>FLV - Most Common</li>
<li>MP4 - Woah! File Size is almost 1.5 times the FLV</li>
<li>3GP - Wow&#8230;youtube mobile compatible? - File size is 1/4th of FLV</li>
<li>There is a fourth optional version called HQ FLV which is only available on selected videos</li>
</ol>
<p>To view in normal mode, just use the normal url, for MP4 mode add fmt=18 at the end of youtube url, for 3GP add fmt=17 and lastly for HQ FLV add fmt=6 at the end of youtube url.</p>
<p>If you want any of these 4 versions just keep the fmt tag appended and then use keepvid.com to download the video from the modified youtube url.</p>
<p>Maybe you already know this, but was a new found for me!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of you must have watched Hindi news channels of India and I am sure you will agree that they are one of the worst news channels ever created. Infact If I have to give an award to one of them, it will be India TV!</p>
<p>Yes, let&#8217;s take the latest example. For 10-10.30 pm, There was absolutely no news covered&#8230;not even in the news ticker at scroll below. All they kept discussing that Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi&#8217;s last episode will be aired today. Kept on talking to their stars, answering people&#8217;s phone calls and discussing stupid issues. And in this whole melee, the news ticker only showed two things: Advertisements and Other announcement mentioning to check their website indiatvnews.com for more news.</p>
<p>After seeing this I wondered, whether they were referring to news online or more such stupid masala online. And when I was thinking this, another ticker scrolled by and said: Missed any of our shows? Watch online! I almost fell down from the chair that what shows are they talking about? Shows which are stupid sting operations with no base and no strong point to cover? Or news items like who raped whom or a boy who threw acid on a girl? Or news like how Sadhvi hypnotised Police officers so that she fails the Narco test? Or news like what&#8217;s happening at the house of the family who lost their member in the Shootout? Or simply coverage of repeat telecast of stupid laughter programmes.</p>
<p>When will these news channels mature and show what&#8217;s called News! News is something that matters to the common man or something which can have change on our lives.</p>
<p>Consider this&#8230;.at this same time, Times Now(a news channel by Times of India in collaboration with Reuters) was showing a debate on when will Indian govt wake up to issues like that lost Ship to pirates or that missing Army Helecopter since August in Naxals area. They were debating on till when will someone have to wake up the govt to act to its responsibilities. And the next one was on Low politics being played by ABVP Students when somebody spat on Indian Parliament Attack accused Professor Geelani.</p>
<p>These were the issues that concern the nation. Nation has no concern what will happen to Kyunki but has concern for how will the govt protect us and work for us.</p>
<p><strong>So here is my humble request to Hindi News Channels - please grow up.</strong></p>
