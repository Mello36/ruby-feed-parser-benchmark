&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href="http://www.mikemoran.com/biznology/bloggers/FrankReed.htm"&gt;Frank Reed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I had an epiphany of sorts. A revelation, if you will. The result of these great new truths in my life were the following; a panic attack, followed by a hypochondriac-type list of symptoms that can be attributed only to that harshest of all diagnoses: reality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; It was one of those days when you hear something in the morning that seems really important and almost random. Then you hear it mid-morning from another source that was unexpected. You start to suspect there might really be something to this but you shrug it off as mere coincidence. When you hear it again around lunch time, you really pay attention and consider that a higher power is work. Then it hits you like a fastball right off your melon--that this thing really is important and you have not given it the time it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I talking about? It's a mission statement. Mission statements apply to all areas of our lives but let's talk about it regarding business and, in particular, your Web presence. "What?" you say. You don't think that having a mission statement for your Web site or blog is necessary? You think that your site is for information purposes only, so what's that have to do with mission? You think that the "plan" that you follow is sufficient? Well, let me put it to you as gently as possible considering the time of year we are in: you are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say this only because I realized even though my blog has a theme and I have plans about what to write, I have never truly established a distinct mission for the blog (other than helping the SMB market understand search marketing a little better, which sounds admirable, but is woefully under-developed). As a result, I can derail very quickly and have a case of "blogger's block" because I am too wide open with my blog. Flexibility is a good thing, but being too flexible is a dangerous thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned in the past that the best organizations each have clearly a defined mission that is the measuring stick for all actions they undertake. Sure, this is not anything new, but it is one of those things that can be overlooked due to being too busy and other things that happen daily. If everyone did this, we would see a lot of stronger companies that would not be in such dire straits even during the current economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to you Web site or blog. What is the mission? Is it to generate leads? Is it to sell product? Is it to brand you or your product? Is it a mixture of these elements? Whatever it is you need to clearly articulate it to everyone who touches your site, be it Web designers, developers, marketers, business owners and on down the line. They all need to know that unless every word, image, and call to action does not literally stink of your mission, then it will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? Think about it for a short second and you will get it. Who rewards a Web site that is focused, targeted, intentional and helps end users get the results they desire? Google. It's pretty simple. Of course there are techniques that can overcome having a less than targeted presence including link building etc etc. Truth is, though, that the best way to attract link partners is to be a site with a mission around what you do best. A site that is clearly thought-out and laser-targeted is one that is useful. Google wants your site to have a mission, and you to be on that mission at all times. Rewards will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be putting some serious thought into my mission. I want to emulate the businesses that I have seen that measure everything they do against their missions. These businesses then make decisions based on whether proposed action accomplishes their mission or at least moves them closer to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These businesses don't get distracted by shiny objects or go down rabbit trails. They just succeed. Thankfully, after today it all seems so much clearer now and I can.&lt;/p&gt;

It's taken me quite a while to post this link, but I am finally getting around to it today. (I kinda saved it for a day when I was at a conference all day and now traveling to get home.) I've done a number of interviews for the second edition of &lt;i&gt;Search Engine Marketing, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;, but this one put more emphasis on what's new in the book, especially the new chapter on social media and multimedia and the new chapter on paid search. Don't be fooled by the "101" title: Carolyn Shelby, Brian Mark, and David Brown asked some good questions that even search veterans might want to think about.  If you've got a few minutes to kick back, check out my &lt;a href="http://www.cshel.com/podcast/seo-101/2008/11/mike-moran-search-engine-marketing-inc/"&gt;SEO 101 interview&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems to be almost always directed to one of two groups; those who are pure online plays or "traditional" companies that have established marketing budgets and some cash that will help them through the current economic times. I still see, read or hear precious little about the bulk of the businesses in the US; the small and medium business (SMB) and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seems as if the SMB's live in the "Land That the Internet Forgot" when you read most internet / search marketing pundits. They talk high theory and re-adjusting of budgets that have been cut but still dwarf the budgets of those who do the bulk of the country's business on Main Street rather than Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I target the 'Main Streeters" with my approach to Internet marketing because I am one of them. I have worked for companies of all sizes over my career, so I can talk to someone in the Fortune 100 as well as someone who has a coffee shop in Nowhere, USA. It's the Nowhere, USA folks that we as an industry seem to simply overlook. To me, it's those folks who are the most interesting of all and stand to gain the most...if we as an industry would truly pay attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what I mean. There are several sites and blogs that talk about small business search and internet marketing. Many are quite good. Problem is they are clubby. They cater to people like me who are in the Internet marketing industry, rather than reaching and educating the people who would most benefit from this information which is the small business owner themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have even seen Internet marketing "providers" (and I use this term in the most loose fashion possible) who claim to specialize in a particular small biz area (lawyers, accountants, and even carpet cleaners) who have put together programs for Web design and Internet marketing that are done for the masses but often end up severely hampering the business person's ability to do the right thing on the Internet in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example is a rug cleaning firm I spoke to that gets hijacked for monthly hosting fees ($100 plus per month for basic hosting) after they were built this "great" site by a specialist in the industry. Trouble is the site is in frames. That's right. Good old fashioned frames that can't be properly indexed by the search.  Same holds true for an accountant I know. These "providers" are able to do this because of small business owner ignorance of the Internet and its best uses for their bottom-line success. Personally, I think this sad, because it is predatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to know how many of you reading this are actual small business owners, or are people who are industry types looking for insights into the mysterious world of Internet marketing. Please chime in with a comment or two about who you are as you read this. Tell me what it is you look for or desire from the Internet marketing industry. Tell me why you are different from the Fortune 500s of the world, and share what YOU are doing to survive these rather difficult times. What is it YOU need?  Maybe I am a tree falling in the forest here and no one will hear me. I am more than curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear people all the time talking about how the Internet is the great equalizer. It levels the playing field where the little guy can take on the big guy and have a fighting chance. The Internet is the rock in the sling of the business David's fighting the mighty corporate Goliaths. Seems to me that there is more hype than reality to that kind of thinking. If the Internet were so egalitarian, then why would so many SMB's know virtually nothing about the Internet, and take the first thing that comes down the pike without even knowing the possible impact (positive or negative) on their ability to make bottom line impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds a bit like whining. I don't know. I do know though that many good, hard-working people are struggling right now because they are ignorant of the Internet opportunity that could be there for them. I am honestly amazed by this fact as we approach 15 or so years of true commercial Internet applications. Seems to me that in this world of change that everyone is clamoring over, this is one change that could be of real impact to real people in real hard times. I'm out.&lt;/p&gt;

This is far from my first appearance on the RSS Ray show, which is one of my favorites because Ray knows so much about Internet marketing. There are no crazy questions here&amp;amp;mdash;just down-to-earth conversation about how to succeed at search marketing, especially for small business owners and others who never want to be "experts." We discuss some basics in search marketing, but also a number of the changes that have occurred since the first edition of the book came out. If you missed the live broadcast, here's the podcast of my &lt;a href="javascript: window.open('http://www.wsradio.com/player/wsradio-player-link.cfm?player=windows&amp;amp;segdate=111908&amp;amp;segment=1&amp;amp;show=ecommercerssradioshow','wind','toolbar=0,location=0,directories=0,status=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=290,scrollbars=no,top=200,left=200'); void('');"&gt;interview with RSS Ray&lt;/a&gt;.

Increasingly, they seem to think the way out is Internet marketing. For my business, anyway, the only sign I see that the economy is tanking is that people that call have a tinge of desperation in their voice--an urgency that compels action now, rather than the old, "We have a task force looking into choosing a committee to consider putting that on the agenda for the senior executives for possible funding next year." No, difficult economic times means that people are more willing to try something new, which is good for anyone in the Internet marketing business, as you can read more about in my new post on Internet Evolution, "&lt;a href="http://www.internetevolution.com/author.asp?section_id=698&amp;amp;doc_id=168707"&gt;Economics Could Revolutionize Internet Marketing&lt;/a&gt;."

        &lt;div class="zemanta-img" style="margin: 1em; float: right; display: block;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Click_the_link_below.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Click_the_link_below.jpg/202px-Click_the_link_below.jpg" alt="Click the link below" style="border: medium none ; display: block;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="zemanta-img-attribution" style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Image via &lt;a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Click_the_link_below.jpg"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Those of you who have read &lt;i&gt;Search Engine Marketing, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; know how I feel about buying links from sites to improve your search rankings. Buying links without full disclosure violates Google's terms of service, as well as those of the other search engines. I have no problem with buying links because you want to get people to click on those links to come to your site, and the search engines have no issue with that, either. But most folks buying and selling links have a different motivation--to improve their organic search rankings. I know this is a prevalent practice, but I wonder if most of them know what they are doing.
        &lt;p&gt;I started wondering about this because in recent weeks I have been approached numerous times by folks wanting to pay me to place "text links" on my site. I know that I should be happy, because even if I don't want to take their money, they are saying that my site is important enough to be worth paying for a link. (Sound of chest puffing out with pride.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wonder about these folks making requests of me. Do they really know what they are getting into? Does buying text links even work to improve search rankings? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I am not naïve. (At least not most of the time.) I know that extremely intelligent and hardworking black hat search experts make a living out of fooling Google. It's a very tough business and I respect the ability it takes to stay at the top of that game, even if I'm too much of an altar boy to defend the ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are these folks contacting me those top-notch black hat pros? I highly doubt it. I mean, it wouldn't take much research to find out what I think of paid links, so the odds of someone actually receiving a paid link from me is rather low. I think the pros, because they are good at what they do, might know who I am and what I think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I think I am being contacted by the folks who aspire to be black belt black hats, but aren't. And I wonder, what are they getting for their money? I mean, I turned them down for links from my site, but they probably send out hundreds of requests each day and actually consummate deals for lots of links.  What do they get when they buy a link?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They get some traffic to their site directly from the link, but that's not why they are buying it. They are buying it to get a boost in search rankings, because search engines use inbound links as part of their ranking algorithm. Does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that it does not work as well as these aspiring black hatters think, for several reasons:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Long-tail keyword don't need links&lt;/i&gt;. For most search queries, there are so few sites that are good matches for the words that links don't have much effect. It's the popular keywords where links really come into play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Popular keywords require lots of links&lt;/i&gt;. If you're trying to get to the top spot for "digital cameras," good luck buying up the thousands of links you need from popular sites. Buying your way to the top of the competitive keywords is not a scalable approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The search engines are wise to you&lt;/i&gt;. I can't prove it, but I think the search engines scrutinize all links quite carefully, and they discount links that might be paid. My guess is that many links get some kind of discount applied&amp;mdash;perhaps a deep discount for especially dubious ones. And Google and friends have no reason to alert you when this is happening, because it would just tell the black hats which techniques are no longer working, when the search engines would rather keep them in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I know there are folks making a living outsmarting Google. I just think it's unlikely that one of them is &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. If you're reading this story, you are probably not a stud black hat, because my advice is so lame for someone in that business. If you are looking for the latest edges against Google, you don't waste your time reading my blog so that I can tell you to be ethical, focus on what your customers want, and be kind to animals. Don't worry, the search rankings will follow, I say soothingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because you are reading this blog, I have to assume that you are a normal, garden variety marketer trying to understand what you should be doing. You're not interested in turning search marketing into a full-time job, and you are willing to die ignorant of what's in Google's ranking algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for you, my advice is to use a radical approach to attracting links to your site. Write good content. Create tools people need. Develop a site that is so good that others want to link to it voluntarily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do, you'll find some other benefits. People who follow your links will be from the right places, and will be the right people for your site. They'll be impressed by your site. Some of them will stick around long enough to buy from you. And some will like what you do so much that they'll pass your message along to still others, using e-mail, social media, and old-fashioned word-of-mouth marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you've been spending your time faking out Google by buying links, my suggestion is that you're wasting your time. I think you'd be better off building yourself into the kind of expert that both search engines and potential customers respect. Instead of building a house of cards that is just waiting for the search engines to knock down, why not build a solid business that withstands every spam investigation and algorithm change?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We approach another Thanksgiving Day and the annual ritual of counting our blessings is carried out across the country. While I have no idea of what you will be thankful for, I do wish everyone reading this only the best for the remainder of this year and next. I have plenty to be thankful for, and I truly am. One of those things is the Internet. Don't get me wrong--there are about 50 other things that go in front of the Internet, but you are reading an Internet business blog after all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I feel thankful that I work in an industry that gives us the opportunity to weather the current economic concerns that can't be avoided even if we wanted to. While we have gone through severe economic times in the past 80 plus years, this one is truly different. With the Internet economy taking its position in the economic fabric of the world, there are ways to get through these times that were not even fathomed even in the late 1980's, with the turmoil that beset the country at that time. For this opportunity to have a way through the current economic fray, I am truly thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the part that I really am not thankful for: the introduction of the Christmas season (sorry, folks, you will never get a politically correct "holiday season" from me, ever) is getting earlier and earlier. As online marketers, this is the time of the year that tends to make or break retailers of all stripes. Now, with the doom and gloom of prognosticators in full swing, there appears to be a concerted effort to bring this season to its commercial height earlier than ever this year. Black Friday is now not a phenomenon that is for the hardcore shopper, but is instead advertised as what every normal person should be paying attention to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, Black Monday, the Internet's version of Black Friday, didn't even get a chance to enjoy the spotlight for more than a few years because now there appears to be less of a line that blurs the commercial onslaught that is the Christmas season in the US.  Even more telling is that if you are reading this as an e-commerce site owner, and you want to capitalize on this season through search marketing, you better have your paid search budget well stocked and ready to go. You see, unless you started a serious SEO push last January in preparation for the season, you have nothing to say for organic traffic other than "Wait 'til next year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get way ahead of ourselves here, in fine American fashion, and make a New Year's resolution right before Thanksgiving. You need to commit to actually starting your SEO efforts for the commercial side of the Christmas season starting, well...today. Expect that next year will be even more competitive, as job losses bring people to online businesses because of low barriers to entry,  and because of the silly thought that if you have a Web site you are bound to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself next year on the outside looking in--again--then maybe you should find another profession. The Internet and e-commerce are unforgiving, and their spirit runs counter to the Thanksgiving and blessings of this time of year. Despite that, I hope that wherever you are on this spectrum, you can find true peace and happiness. So right now I will do what every good American should do a day or two before Thanksgiving. I will wish you a wonderful Thanksgiving, a Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, a fantastic Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a romantic Valentine's Day, a spectacular St. Patrick's Day and, last but not least, a beautiful Mother's Day. Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens to your Internet marketing strategy when the Internet itself expands beyond the realm of desktops, laptops and hand held devices and becomes ubiquitous? For years, we've been hearing about how cyberspace is coming, but it's finally here. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0317218/" title="William Gibson" rel="imdb" class="zem_slink"&gt;William Gibson&lt;/a&gt;, the American-Canadian science-fiction writer, better known by his &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0007119585%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/Neuromancer-Voyager-Classics-William-Gibson/dp/0007119585%253FSubscriptionId=0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82" title="Neuromancer (Voyager Classics)" rel="amazon" class="zem_slink"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; novel and by coining the term "cyberspace," stated last year in a &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/17227831/william_gibson_the_rolling_stone_40th_anniversary_interview/print"&gt;Rolling Stone interview&lt;/a&gt;, "When I wrote &lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt; in 1984, cyberspace already existed for some people, but they didn't spend all their time there. So cyberspace was there, and we were here. Now cyberspace is here for a lot of us, and there has become any state of relative nonconnectivity. There is where they don't have Wi-Fi. In a world of superubiquitous computing, you're not gonna know when you're on or when you're off. You're always going to be on, in some sort of blended-reality state. You only think about it when something goes wrong and it goes off."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;img alt="TheBayWindow.png" src="http://mikemoran.com/biznology/blog/images/blog/TheBayWindow.png" class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" width="150" height="373"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Back in February, while braving the busy Toronto streets downtown--believe me, braving is the right word to use for walking outside in Canada during winter time--I saw something different in the large display windows for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bay"&gt;The Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Most passersby were initially oblivious to it, but then started noticing the displays in the store were actually reacting to their movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more about the technology behind The Bay's immersive interactive displays &lt;a href="http://www.marketingmag.ca/english/news/marketer/article.jsp?content=20080228_777333_2383"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnNhYnQgSS0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the summer came, and Radiohead released its fantastic House of Cards video, where no cameras or lights were used, just data, allowing a 3-D rendering and manipulation of a live performance. You can see the YouTube video below to get an idea of it, but for a cooler demo, try it out through the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/creative/radiohead/viewer.html"&gt;Google 3-D viewer&lt;/a&gt;. The potential of this technology is enormous both for video surveillance in areas of high risk and for major events such as concerts and soccer games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when attending &lt;a href="http://ignitenyc.org/"&gt;Ignite NYC&lt;/a&gt; back in September, I learned that Botanicalls was offering kits that would allow plants to post updates via Twitter whenever they needed water! They actually announced that back in February, so I was kind of last one to know. &lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;img alt="BotanicalTwitter.png" src="http://mikemoran.com/biznology/blog/images/blog/BotanicalTwitter.png" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" width="300" height="236"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;From all the &lt;a href="http://www.dailybits.com/5-terrific-twitter-uses/"&gt;unusual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://socialmediatrader.com/13-odd-ways-to-use-twitter/"&gt;odd&lt;/a&gt; uses of Twitter, that one certainly takes the cake. After you water your little green ones, they even send you tweets saying "Thanks!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these uses seem either inconsequential or just plain fads, there's increasing evidence that cyberspace is spreading outside your computer or mobile screens. At this point, it's hard to say if all this is leading us to a Orwellian world of mass-surveillance or to a smarter world where an instrumented, interconnected and intelligent planet will translate to a greener, kinder and more sustainable reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the readers of Biznology, it's important to ensure that your Internet marketing strategy accounts for this trend, expanding beyond the conventional Web and reaching out to the cyberspace that's no longer there, but right here, in the streets, stadiums, and even in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

As a way of contrasting the secret of Internet success with what worked in the olden days, that phrase helped sum up an important insight, but it was never the whole picture. Today, the Web has changed to become a medium that connects people to other people, often through content, but not always. To find how why I say relationship is now king, and to find out what marketers should do about it, read my new article on Internet Evolution entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.internetevolution.com/author.asp?section_id=698&amp;amp;doc_id=168468"&gt;For Internet Marketing, Content Is King No More&lt;/a&gt;."

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href="http://www.mikemoran.com/biznology/bloggers/FrankReed.htm"&gt;Frank Reed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wondered whether you are the client of your search marketing agency or just another victim of a marketing predator, read on. Small business owners, because they must be generalists, are especially vulnerable to fast-talking specialists who over-promise and under-deliver. If you are concerned about becoming prey and don't know what else to do but pray, I have some advice for you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before I get going here I want to disclose one thing and warn about another. First, the disclosure: I am a lifelong sales professional and I am actually proud of it because I firmly believe that, when done correctly, sales is a helping profession that can serve people. Now for the warning: What you are about to read is part rant, part experience, part anger, part disgust, and all honesty. You see, I am passionate about search marketing. I am also passionate about professional and ethical sales practices. My problem is that I am not sure that these two areas have ever been formally introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, what I have seen of the marriage of the search marketing space and the level of sales professionalism has been limited at best. For the first decade of its existence search marketing sales efforts have been predatory on a good day and just disgusting on a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we search marketers think that the rest of the business world understands search marketing and its many nuances, that is simply not true. Most SMB (small and medium business) owners and marketers don't even realize that the top results of a SERP (search engine result page) is usually held by paying advertisers. Go ahead and laugh. It's until the industry understands this, though, that sales people will continue to prey on these people who are just trying to do good business but are ignorant of how search works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don't get long winded here, just listen to these simple words of warning for SMB's:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your search marketing sales person is trying to give you some kind of time-related discount, or an ultimatum about signing up for their services, just turn and run. That's an old-fashioned closing technique that has no room in real business at any level in our modern world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your sales person dodges your question, and uses spin and redirection to avoid answering it directly, then turn and run. Demand that your sales person knows what he or she is selling. PROTECT YOURSELF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it sounds too good to be true, it absolutely is, and if the word guarantee occurs anywhere in the conversation other than the statement "We cannot guarantee anything," then run.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pray&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an SMB owner or marketing professional who has little or limited knowledge of the intricacies of search marketing, please consider hitting your knees in prayer before embarking on finding a partner in the space. This is not your only defense against the sales predators that are trying to close you to meet quota, but it's a darn good place to start. Also, take a look at these few quick pointers to protect yourself as you go out into the wild world of search. Oh, and for those of you who have already been burned by my industry? My apologies and a suggestion that you look at this list and get back to basic blocking and tackling yourself. That's how you win against this nemesis known as the search marketing sales person.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do your homework. There are hundreds of free online  resources that can give you a basic understanding of the good, the bad, and the ugly of search marketing. Do a Google search to find them. Read them please, I implore you! If you go out there looking for someone to "guide you through the process" then expect to be guided right to their version of the solution which might not fit your needs at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask questions. Then ask a few more questions. Then ask some more. Make sure your sales people know their stuff. Check them for consistency. Are they saying anything to get you to say yes? Do they occasionally say, "No we can't do that?" If they say that, then you might want to listen more closely, because they could actually be telling you the truth!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't "Go to bid." What do I mean? If you think that any respectable sales person wants to hear that the opportunity is being put "out to bid," then you are only inviting the worst of the worst to participate. By putting something out to bid, the likelihood of getting a customized service that actually meets your needs diminishes significantly. Most good sales people will pass this opportunity along because they know that it will likely end in disaster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there. I said some of it. Honestly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I personally believe that in this era of change there needs to be significant reform of the sales of search marketing services. Until now, it has been sloppy at best and downright dishonest and predatory at worst. Unfortunately, with the economic times being what they are, there is a chance that it could get worse as desperation sets in. Don't get caught! Do your homework. Oh, and if you have any questions give me a call. I'll give you the straight shoot unless it's the end of the month and I haven't reached quota yet. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you consider yourself customer-friendly? Always looking to start the conversation&amp;mdash;or continue it? You might be surprised to find that a common practice is undermining any friendly sentiment your e-mail recipient might receive. I'm talking about donotreply@ e-mails. Often, with today's smartphones and e-mail preview panes and popup alerts, the sender's name and first lines of the e-mail are your first impression coming through the inbox door. If you are presently using a donotreply@ address in your e-mail marketing, stop what you're doing right now and spend some time figuring out how to get over it&amp;mdash;because a donotreply@ address in your e-mail marketing is about as effective as halitosis in a breath mint salesman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I detest donotreply@ e-mails. What impression do you think this gives your e-mail recipients?&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject: xxxxxx RESERVATION CONFIRMATION &lt;br /&gt;
Preview: THIS IS AN AUTOMATED EMAIL, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS MESSAGE.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Perhaps I should consider how to REPLY INDIRECTLY to advise them how to disengage the caps lock key. Check out the following for more weirdness: you want me to add someone who doesn't want to hear from me to my cherished contact list, shoulder-to-shoulder with my mom's address?&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject: Here is your XXXXXX Newsletter&lt;br /&gt;
Preview: Please add noreply@xxxx.xxx to your contact list&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we marketers agonize over open rates, subject lines, and staying on the right side of the spam filters, we ought to pay a modicum of attention to our return address and the first line of the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine this scenario. You're at a business conference, and a stranger approaches you:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hi, someone told me I should get in touch with you because you were interested in us. Here's information about us. But please, don't respond&amp;mdash;it is really a bother when you respond to us. You see, we really think you should listen to us because we have big important things to say, but we don't have the time to listen to you. Because you write with all kinds of little stuff about you, and we don't want to take the time to sort through it all and pass it on to the right people. So just don't respond to us."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"OK. Well, what if I want to ask you something about the information you're giving me now?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Well, you can go to our Web site, and poke around until you find a way to contact us. Or you can contact us like you have before."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I've never contacted you before."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What's that? Oh, don't bother responding. Look, I've got other people to meet. Read over that information I gave you, OK?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With modern e-mail management tools (as opposed to the steam-powered tools we had back when we started) it is relatively trivial to set up some public facing e-mail accounts such as service@ , sales@ , suggestion@ , or anything else you can think of that would pass muster with the mail servers. Those e-mails can then be distributed to individual recipients&amp;mdash;or multiple recipients&amp;mdash;for response. It isn't hard, honestly. But it does take a bit of collaboration between IT and marketing and sales. But if you can't convince your own IT department of the merits of providing good customer service, should you really be in sales? (Hint to my friends in IT: customer service is a GOOD thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked my own mailbox, and without breaking a nail I found 40 e-mails addressed from "donotreply@' followed by the domain name of the sender. One of these is from a social marketing site&amp;mdash;can you imagine? That's annoying and off-putting, but it could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies aren't even careful enough to use their own domain, where they at least have a modicum of control over any inconvenient responses. Instead, they use @donotreply.com ... at which point the friendly folk at donotreply.com get that info to do with as they will. By that method, &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/03/they_told_you_not_to_reply.html"&gt;donotreply.com raises money for animal protection charities&lt;/a&gt; from companies that want their e-mails removed from public view. See, as a foster dog parent, I'm good with that, but perhaps you could just send the money directly to a charity organization and skip the &lt;i&gt;faux pas&lt;/i&gt; of potentially exposing your customer's data to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can you do instead of bludgeoning your contacts with apathy? I reviewed the real, live e-mails I found at hand and quickly brainstormed some alternatives:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're a social marketing site, and you e-mail me a birthday reminder for a friend, why not set up the reply-to address so that it generates a post to my friend? The devil's in the details here, but it could work pretty sweetly. And you get a validated action to show that my e-mail's still live and in use&amp;mdash;as a bonus!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're a site traffic monitoring provider, why not send replies to your sales department? Perhaps if I have questions about my site traffic, I might be ready for an upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're a professional organization sending an order confirmation, why not set the reply-to for the customer service department, in case I have questions about my order or want to add more items to my order?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're a veterinary services provider reminding me that my dog needs shots, why not set the reply to the appointment scheduler?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're inviting me to a Webinar, why not have my reply interpreted as an acceptance of the invitation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One e-mail I reviewed had me stumped for a few moments. It was a flight confirmation, with plenty of additional information included about baggage handling and where to get flight status and the wonderful tropical destinations I could go to as alternatives. Should replies to such an e-mail go to service, or to an autoresponder with flight status, or the sales department to set me up for Cabo San Lucas? I pondered until the obvious occurred to me&amp;mdash;the message was too cluttered to be effective at much of anything . Review your messages. and if you're having trouble figuring out where to send replies, your customer probably won't have a clear idea of how to respond either.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the technical reasons that we might have for asking for an address to be added to an address book (so that it doesn't get marked as spam for being an unknown recipient), or for advising a mail recipient that the e-mail box is unmonitored. Truly, I do&amp;mdash;I've run campaigns where the blow-back of replies is truly amazing. But there are a plethora of parsers, a slew of scripts, scads of sequential autoresponders. and plenty of personnel available to handle these replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/confirmation-email.html"&gt;Experts can advise you on e-mail usability&lt;/a&gt;--usability matters a lot in relationship building. E-mail marketing is a two-way channel. One-way communication with e-mail is nothing better than telling your customers off.&lt;/p&gt;
