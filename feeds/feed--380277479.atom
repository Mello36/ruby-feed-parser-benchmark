<p>Dan Kimerling's article on TechCrunch entitled <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/04/the-seeds-of-the-next-big-thing-are-being-planted-now/">The Seeds of the Next Big Thing Are Being Planted Now</a> echoes what other people have told me privately. Although it might seem bleak as hell right now, it's in the troughs that small companies can spring up. And some of my favorite small design firms (Adaptive Path, Mule, Behavior) all started in 2000-2001, at the bottom of the last crash. I hope I'm as lucky.<p>Right now, though, it feels a little like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)">playing chicken</a> with the world. Who will blink first?

<![CDATA[<p>I know there is no reason to trust my judgement in predicting TV shows after my <a href="http://www.odannyboy.com/blog/new_archives/2007/05/next_falls_tv_p.html">last</a> <a href="http://www.odannyboy.com/blog/new_archives/2006/04/studio_60_setti.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.odannyboy.com/blog/new_archives/2007/01/give_aaron_sork.html">blunders</a>. But this time is different, and on the basis of a season and a half of episodes, I have to say: Mad Men is better than The Sopranos in all the ways that it counts. Mad Men isn't as groundbreaking as Lost or as richly complex as The Wire, but neither was The Sopranos, and that show got oodles of accolades. Mad Men, however, is the superior show.
<p>Everyone seems to forget that The Sopranos was a wildly uneven show in tone, character development, and plot. Lots of plot happened that seemed disconnected to reality--even the reality set up by the show itself. Whole plotlines and characters were started and dropped, never to be seen again. Some of the character development made little sense and seemed gimmicky, like AJ's suicide attempt or Uncle Junior's dementia. You'd have a wacky episode with Christopher and Paulie getting stuck in the woods, then another with the graphic rape of Dr. Melfi. The show's apologists (and there are legions) will say, well, that's how life is. But this is a scripted drama, not life. I want storytelling and narrative arcs that lead somewhere, not just to a final blackout.
<p>Compare this to Mad Men. Mad Men, like another great show Deadwood, has a consistent tone and is pitch perfect. Characters are well-drawn and nuanced. Plots lead to revelations: both moving the story forward and by revealing character. And, let's not forget, doing so partially in the space/difference between the era of the 1960s to our own. This is no easy feat. If you don't think this can be done badly, you didn't see Swingtown.
<p>The Sopranos had to use violence for shock and punctuation. Mad Men uses words. Tension in Mad Men comes from character, not necessarily situation.<p>The Sopranos, at its heart, was a family soap opera. It didn't really care overmuch about how Tony and Crew worked, except in the broadest way. Which is why a lot of the intrigue with the other Families felt muddled and/or flat. Mad Men though is a workplace drama, like Hill Street Blues or Homicide: Life on the Street. It reveals character by how people behave doing their work. Which, in a cruder way, The Sopranos did as well, but the extremeness of the situation (whacking people) warping the situation so that all subtly was rubbed out.
<p>Mad Men cares about the context the drama lives in. The characters aren't modern day types dropped into spiffy suits. We can see how their characters are shaped by the time and visa versa. We barely even knew what decade it was with The Sopranos, aside from some 9/11 references.
<p>In any case, Mad Men now deserves your attention and your post-Sopranos praise.]]>

<![CDATA[<p>
From <em>White Noise</em>:
</p><p>
I went to the automated teller machine to check my balance. I inserted my card, entered my secret code, tapped out my request. The figure on the screen roughly corresponded to my independent estimate, feebly arrived at after long searches through documents, tormented arithmetic. Waves of relief and gratitude flowed over me. The system had blessed my life. I felt its support and approval. The system hardware, the mainframe sitting in a locked room in some distant city. What a pleasing interaction. I sensed something of deep personal value, but not money, not that at all, had been authenticated and confirmed. A deranged person was escorted from the bank by two armed guards. The system was invisible, which made it all the more impressive, all the more disquieting to deal with. But we were in accord, at least for now. The networks, the circuits, the streams, the harmonies.<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>From <i>Underworld</i>:
<p>
In her veil and habit she was basically a face, or a face and scrubbed hands. Here in cyberspace she has shed all that steam-ironed fabric. She is not naked exactly but she is open—exposed to every connection you can make on the world wide web.
</p>
<p>There is no space or time out here, or in here, or wherever she is. There are only connections. Everything is connected. All human knowledge is gathered and linked, hyperlinked, this site leading to that, this fact referenced to that, a keystroke, a mouse-click, a password—world without end, amen.
<p>But she is in cyberspace, not heaven, and she feels the grip of systems. This is why she is so uneasy. There is a presence here, a thing implied, something vast and bright. She senses the paranoia of the web, the net. There's the perennial threat of virus of course. Sister knows all about contaminations and the protective measures they require. This is different—it's a glow, a lustrous rushing force that seems to flow from a billion net nodes.
<p>When you decide on a whim to visit the H-bomb home page, she begins to understand. Everything in your computer, the plastic, silicon and mylar, every logical operation and processing function, the memory, the hardware, the software, the ones and zeroes, the triads inside the pixels that form the on-screen image—it all culminates here.

<![CDATA[<p>I don't usually review academic papers, mostly just design books. But in doing research for <a href="http://www.designinggesturalinterfaces.com">the new book</a>, I stumbled across <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2006/HowBodiesMatter-DIS2006.pdf">How Bodies Matter: Five Themes for Interaction Design</a> by Scott Klemmer, Björn Hartmann, and Leila Takayama of Stanford. It's two years old (as of this writing), but I think its themes are dead on and even more relevant now than before, and if you are interested in the future of interaction design, it is well worth a read.
<p>The basic thrust of the paper is that with the current keyboard-mouse-monitor set-up, we do every task, no matter if it is writing a paper or editing a movie or even playing a game, all the same way. Pointing, clicking, dragging and dropping, etc. The work has become "homogenized" and we can do better, creating richer interactions.
<p>Here are their themes:<ul><li type="square"><b>Thinking Through Doing.</b> There are a lot of skills you simply cannot learn by reading or listening alone. You have to try them out. Gestures aren't just for embellishment to communication, they can also be an aid to learning and understanding. Manipulation of items allows for greater understanding of the item. Artifacts have their own characteristics, and their "backtalk" uncovers problems or can suggest new designs.
<li type="square"><b>Performance.</b> We should design products for expert users, able to use their hands and motor memory to perform action-centered skills. Thinking can be too slow; experiental cognition (learned skillful behavior like driving a car) can be more rapid and powerful than reflective cognition.
<li type="square"><b>Visibility.</b> Through the performance of an activity, that activity can be made visible to others easily, so that collaboration and situated learning can occur spontaneously.<li type="square"><b>Risk.</b> Most products are designed to decrease risk, but retaining some risk can be beneficial. With risk comes trust, responsibility, and attention.<li type="square"><b>Thick Practice.</b> Because there is so much benefit to the real world, we should be careful with replacing physical artifacts with digital ones. The best case scenario is to augment the physical world with digital behaviors, and thus "admitting the improvisations of practice that the physical world offers."</ul>
<p>One of the few academic papers I have enjoyed recently.]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Annoyance at spam twitter accounts had me lock up my twitter updates last week. The upshot of that was that by doing so, I moved some 500 people who had been following me into twitter limbo. For the last few days, I've been having to decide, one by one, which ones I let return to seeing my updates. Rather than do this willy-nilly, I came up with some basic rules that might be interesting to you as well.
<p>In order for me to let you have a glimpse of my life, I've decided, I need to know you or know of you, or at a minimum want to know you. If I don't know you or know of you, the only way I can tell if I want to know you is from your online identity, which in this case means glancing at your twitter profile. If you follow thousands of people, I'm probably not going to let you follow me, because it bespeaks of a lack of interest in me as an individual. If the "person" is a company, product or service, forget it. There has to be some benefit to me in your seeing some of me, and that is unlikely to be the case with most companies. I can see how it might benefit them, but me? Unlikely.
<p>The bar is much higher for me to choose to follow someone. In order for me to do that, there are two criteria: I have to know you well (we've at least had drinks or a meal), and you have to use your twitter account in a way that I find acceptable. By that I mean you don't twitter excessively or have long @ conversations or only @ people. You need to have something to say for me to want to hear it, not just responses. I have to know you well for the simple reason I need to understand a little of your life to make sense of some of your messages. Where you live, your family life, what you do for a living, your sense of humor, etc. Without context, a twitter stream can simply be stuff and nonsense.
<p>Now, abstracting this just a little to all social networks isn't much of a stretch.<ul><li type="square">Have something to say.<li type="square">Pick and choose who you follow and who follows you carefully.<li type="square">Offline context still matters.<li type="square">Reveal only as much as is necessary.<li type="square">Give me a reason to follow you--and to share with you.</ul>
<p>It's a start anyway.]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, we're already thinking about next year's Interaction09, following the sell-out success of <a href="http://interaction08.ixda.org/">Interaction08</a>. But we're not resting on our laurels: One of the things I'm curious about is why some of you chose to attend other conferences—IA Summit, CHI, etc.—instead of (or in addition to) Interaction08.
<p>Obviously, we're not going to change the focus of the conference away from interaction design, but if there were other factors that caused you to instead go elsewhere, I'd be curious to hear them. Everything is up for grabs: location, program, etc. Email me at dan AT odannyboy DOT com or leave a comment.]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I unwittingly entered Bizzaro World yesterday when the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-nolaptops31mar31,0,7194079.story">LA Times put on its front page</a> a story about Todd Wilkens' <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2007/11/15/my-personal-war-against-crackberry/">War on Crackberries</a> which mentioned a term I'd jokingly come up with two years ago: the "topless" (as in <i>lap</i>topless) meeting. United Press <a href="http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Quirks/2008/03/31/companies_go_topless_at_meetings/2129/">picked up the story</a>, and before you know it, we had three news crews in the office asking me about going topless.
<p>The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4560823">ABC piece</a> was national which was fun (my parents' friends called them: "Danny was on TV!"). Ironically, the ABC News clip is preceded by an ad for Blackberry. Heh.<P>Here's the local CBS news:

<p>Here's the local NBC clip:

<p>Some <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2008/03/31/rules-for-topless-meetings/">guidelines for topless meetings</a>.
<p>Going topless at meetings is apparently <a href="http://womensissues.about.com/b/2008/04/01/why-im-going-topless-at-meetings.htm">a women's issue</a> too.]]>

<title>In Praise of a Water Bottle</title>

<summary type="text/plain">At the airport on the way to Austin last week, I bought a bottle of water. Or, more precisely, I bought the plastic container that the water came in. The water was just a bonus. The bottle, by SEI Water, is shaped like a large hip flask or canteen instead of the typical round cylinder, and it feels sturdier too. I spent a little bit more for this water bottle because I liked the form factor. The bottle drew comments everywhere I went, because (and here is the point) when I was done with it, I didn&apos;t throw it out like I do with every other water bottle. I kept refilling it, rather than discard it. It fit so well in my hand and looked so good with its sleek Helvetica Neue logo, I didn&apos;t want to get rid of it once its initial &quot;use&quot; was up. Five days later, I still have it. An airport water bottle.That&apos;s good design.</summary>
