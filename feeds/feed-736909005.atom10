<p>Some of the things we discussed:<br />
- a quick story about interviewing at Google in 1999<br />
- the opportunities of cell phones and mobile platforms (3 billion of them!) vs. personal computers, as well as hyperlocal information.<br />
- cloud storage servers and storing your data in the cloud<br />
- how it&#8217;s cheaper than ever to start an internet business, with a choice of platforms ranging from Facebook, iPhone, Android, OpenSocial, to Google App Engine.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/pubcon-video-interview/">my last video</a> I got <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rickroll">rickroll&#8217;ed</a> in the background. This time the background was psychedelic, because the main conference stage was behind us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/my-schedule-for-late-2008/">spoke at a few conferences</a> in the second half of 2008, and a video interview from <a href="http://www.pubcon.com/">PubCon</a> recently came out.</p>
<p>The always-charming Mike McDonald and I did a <a href="http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/11/18/matt-cutts-on-changes-at-google/">10 minute video interview</a> at PubCon a couple weeks ago. A few of the topics that this interview covers:</p>
<p>- how personalized search affects SEO and how ranking reports become less important over time as a result<br />
- the fact that Google returns different search results by country, e.g. a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bank">[bank] for the United States</a> returns different results than <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bank">[bank] in the UK</a> or in <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=bank">Australia</a>. (Note: I had a brain freeze and said &#8220;Thomas Cook&#8221; when I meant to say &#8220;Barclays&#8221; or &#8220;Lloyds TSB&#8221; as an example of British banks)<br />
- the broadening role of SEO and embracing the fact that SEO is a type of marketing<br />
- we talked about Flash, and I pointed out that while Google has gotten much better at crawling and indexing Flash, you can&#8217;t just think about search engines; you also have think about the user experience, especially on mobile devices these days.<br />
- we discussed 2009 trends in SEO, including: 1) expect many people to embrace broader view of SEO that includes marketing and social media such as Twitter, and 2) blackhat SEO will become even more malicious<br />
- subdomains vs. subdirectories<br />
- we also chatted briefly about the Kentucky basketball team (Go Wildcats!)</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/11/18/matt-cutts-on-changes-at-google/">interview for yourself</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<p>OneStat says that they see <a href="http://www.onestat.com/html/press-release-google-chrome-global-usage-share.html">0.54% share</a> for <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. Net Applications provides an <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?sample=21&#038;qprid=43&#038;qpcustom=Chrome+0.4">hour-by-hour graph</a>, which is nice, but they hardwired it to look for the string &#8220;Chrome 0.2&#8243; when Chrome is on version 0.3 or 0.4 by now. Just eyeballing the Chrome 0.3 version stats, it looked like about 0.85% market share according to Net Applications. Hey Net Applications folks, any chance you&#8217;d be willing to roll up all the Chrome versions into your hourly report?</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t realized that Internet Explorer usage had dropped so low for my site (~26%). What does your browser marketshare stats look like for the last month or so for your site(s)?</p>
<p>P.S. Stephen Shankland writes about <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10107152-2.html">switching to Google Chrome because of the speed</a>, while ExtremeTech also concluded that <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2335242,00.asp">Chrome is speedy</a>. And if you haven&#8217;t seen it, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2008/11/beta-release-0415425.html">new version of Chrome (0.4.154.25)</a> that adds a couple nice features:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Bookmark manager with import/export.<br />
</strong>Use the &#8216;Customize and control Google Chrome&#8217; (wrench) menu to open the Bookmark manager. You can search bookmarks, create folders, and drag and drop bookmarks to new locations. The Bookmark Manager&#8217;s Tools menu lets you export or import bookmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy section in Options.<br />
</strong>We grouped together all of the configuration options for features that might send data to another service. Open the wrench menu, click Options, and select the Under the Hood tab.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I run the <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel/">dev channel version of Chrome</a> because I like to see what cool features are coming soon. I think the dev channel has averaged weekly updates, which is really nice because you can literally watch plug-in fixes and other improvements arrive every few days. It&#8217;s wild to see client software updated that often instead of every few months.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 11/28/2008</strong>: Somehow I missed the <a href="http://getclicky.com/global-marketshare-statistics">getclicky.com browser marketshare stats</a> from 60K+ sites. They peg Chrome at 1.55%, with a little bit of 1.6% to 1.7% in the last week or so.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really want to run Ubuntu, but it shouldn&#8217;t be this hard. Plugging in an SD card reader that I picked up from Best Buy shouldn&#8217;t cause a hard freeze of my system (on both Gutsy Gibbon and Intrepid Ibex):</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/sd-card-reader.jpg" alt="SD Card Reader" /></center></p>
<p>The card reader works fine in Windows. At this point, I&#8217;m honestly thinking about crashing the <a href="http://osdir.com/ml/linux.ubuntu.devel.announce/2008-07/msg00004.html">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a> that will be held in December at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA to pick peoples&#8217; brains.</p>
<p>Okay, so Ubuntu freezes hard when you plug in the card reader (sometimes). Unless you report that bug, no one will know to fix it. So I&#8217;m trying to follow these <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingRemovableDevices">instructions for debugging removable devices</a> to do a good Ubuntu bug report, and finding that the instructions are pretty out-of-date.</p>
<p>For example, you&#8217;re supposed to kill, then start gnome-volume-manager in a foreground mode to see debugging messages. Except that the latest version of Ubuntu (Intrepid Ibex) doesn&#8217;t even install gnome-volume-manager. Oh, you can install it (and you&#8217;ll get the sound-juicer package with it). But when you try to run it, you&#8217;ll get this helpful message:</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ /usr/lib/gnome-volume-manager/gnome-volume-manager -n<br />
manager.c/685: setting[0]: string: filemanager = nautilus -n &#8211;no-desktop %m<br />
manager.c/690: setting[1]: bool: autophoto = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[2]: string: autophoto_command = f-spot-import<br />
manager.c/690: setting[3]: bool: autovideocam = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[4]: string: autovideocam_command =<br />
manager.c/690: setting[5]: bool: autowebcam = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[6]: string: autowebcam_command = cheese &#8211;hal-device=%h<br />
manager.c/690: setting[7]: bool: autopalmsync = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[8]: string: autopalmsync_command = gpilotd-control-applet<br />
manager.c/690: setting[9]: bool: autopocketpc = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[10]: string: autopocketpc_command = multisync<br />

manager.c/685: setting[12]: string: autoprinter_command =<br />
manager.c/690: setting[13]: bool: autoscanner = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[14]: string: autoscanner_command = xsane<br />
manager.c/690: setting[15]: bool: autokeyboard = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[16]: string: autokeyboard_command =<br />
manager.c/690: setting[17]: bool: automouse = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[18]: string: automouse_command =<br />
manager.c/690: setting[19]: bool: autotablet = 0<br />
manager.c/685: setting[20]: string: autotablet_command =<br />
manager.c/699: settings[21]: float: percent_threshold = 0.050000<br />
manager.c/699: settings[22]: float: percent_used = 0.010000<br />
manager.c/664: daemon exit: live and let die
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to find the <a href="http://gnome-volume-manager.sourcearchive.com/documentation/2.24.0-0ubuntu1/manager_8c-source.html">source code of gnome-volume-manager</a> online, but the relevant function is more cute than informative. Searching for ["live and let die" gnome-volume-manager] finds <a href="http://imc.livejournal.com/183672.html?thread=491640">this post</a> where someone tries to guess what the message means:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fedora no longer uses gnome-volume-manager to auto-mount removable media — it&#8217;s now built into Nautilus. I am guessing that &#8220;live and let die&#8221; means &#8220;hey, someone else is already managing this&#8221; but that is pure speculation on my part. So if you get that error message it just means that you shouldn&#8217;t have been running it in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that clue, you can go back and find <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5925651">this thread</a> where Ubuntu developer wgrant helpfully lets someone know &#8220;gnome-volume-manager is no longer necessary either - nautilus does the mounting now.&#8221; It is good to find an Ubuntu developer posting answers online. But now I&#8217;m not sure how to generate Nautilus debugging logs akin to the gnome-volume-manager logs that fellow Ubuntu folks could use to debug the hard freeze. At least I do know how to generate <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/udevadm-udevmonitor/">udevmonitor logs using the new udevadm program</a>.</p>
<p>Please pardon the melancholy tone. It&#8217;s just frustrating that plugging in an SD card reader can cause sporadic freezes on my Ubuntu computer. And if you plug in the SD card reader often enough, you may <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/ubuntu-freeze-no-resume-image/">corrupt your system</a>. I do see progress from Hardy Heron to Intrepid Ibex with <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/six-annoyances-in-hardy-heron-ubuntu/">several annoyances</a> fixed, but there&#8217;s still a way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: If any Linux/Ubuntu folks want to dig into it, I put all the log files I could think of at <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/files/sandisk/">http://www.mattcutts.com/files/sandisk/</a> for folks that want to check it out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you&#8217;re looking for the &#8220;udevmonitor&#8221; program on the Intrepid Ibex version of Ubuntu, it&#8217;s changed; use &#8220;udevadm monitor&#8221; now:</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ udevadm help<br />
Usage: udevadm COMMAND [OPTIONS]<br />
  info         query sysfs or the udev database<br />
  trigger      request events from the kernel<br />
  settle       wait for the event queue to finish<br />
  control      control the udev daemon<br />
  monitor      listen to kernel and udev events<br />
  test         simulation run<br />
  version      print the version number<br />
  help         print this help text
</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like udevmonitor was a symlink, and around <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/opensuse/factory/x86_64/udev-128-7.1.x86_64.html">April 2008</a>, that symlink was removed. Someone asked about it on the Linux kernel mailing list and received <a href="http://markmail.org/message/dlluk3wur2ntce34">this reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All udev tools are in one single binary called &#8220;udevadm&#8221;, which is<br />
always in /sbin, and not like the old tools spread around in /sbin,<br />
/usr/bin, /usr/sbin. See &#8220;man udev&#8221; for the reference to udevadm, and<br />
&#8220;man udevadm&#8221; for the commands, which have been the individual tools<br />
before.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you have a USB device that causes a hard freeze of your Linux computer when you plug it in, and you want to run udevmonitor to debug it, use udevadm monitor instead.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This is a boring post that I&#8217;m writing for people that have this same problem in the future. Just skip it.)</p>
<p>Every good Linux user knows that if you want to drop from X down into a text-based virtual terminal, you can press control-alt-F1 (or any other key up to F6), and control-alt-F7 returns you to the graphical mode. But what if that doesn&#8217;t work? In my case, it turned out to be my keyboard. My Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 has a key marked &#8220;F Lock&#8221; and unless that FLock key is activated (the &#8220;F&#8221; LED should be on), the wrong keystrokes were being sent to my Linux Ubuntu version of Intrepid Ibex. How can you debug this? Well, it took me a while.</p>
<p>After some Googling, here&#8217;s how I&#8217;d write the flowchart:</p>
<p>- <strong>Try running &#8220;chvt 1&#8243; to switch your console to virtual terminal 1</strong>.<br />
- If &#8220;chvt 1&#8243; does not work, you might get the message &#8220;Couldnt get a file descriptor referring to the console&#8221;. You probably need to be superroot. Once you run as root, that command should work.<br />
- Maybe &#8220;chvt 1&#8243; fails in some other way. Dude, you&#8217;re outside my area of expertise. You could try <a href="http://pennsylvania.ubuntuforums.com/showthread.php?&#038;t=955302&#038;page=2">typing &#8220;sudo modprobe vga16fb; sudo modprobe fbcon&#8221;</a> . Or you could try <a href="http://ralph.n3rds.net/index.php?/archives/202-Blank-ttys.html">typing the command &#8220;setupcon&#8221;</a> to set up the font and keyboard on the Linux console. Or it&#8217;s possible that you need to <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/35329">edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and tweak the vga= setting or remove the &#8220;splash&#8221; parameter</a>. Or you might want to <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/02/determine-virtual-terminal-you-are.html">check your /etc/gdm/gdm.conf file</a>.</p>
<p>- Quick check: you might have the <a href="http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.0/doc/Xorg.1.html">&#8220;DontVTSwitch&#8221; option set in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file</a>, which would disable virtual terminal switching.</p>
<p>- <strong>If running &#8220;chvt 1&#8243; as superroot does work</strong>, then you probably have an issue with your keyboard mappings somehow.<br />
- If you have a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, make sure that the &#8220;F-Lock&#8221; key near the top-right of the main part of the keyboard is properly engaged. The &#8220;F&#8221; LED below the keyboard should be on.<br />
- Next, run xev (possibly as root) to see raw xevents as you press keys. This <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-user@lists.debian.org/msg522108.html">thread helped</a>, where the person said</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently I tried to switch to VT (console) and I couldn&#8217;t - Ctrl+Alt+F1 didn&#8217;t work (and they used to couple of weeks ago). I don&#8217;t even know where to look for the problem; xev detects KeyRelease XF86_Switch_VT_1 event, /etc/inittab contain getty respawns.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I ran xev myself, and pressed control-alt-F1, I saw an event like</p>
<blockquote><p>
KeyPress event, serial 38, synthetic NO, window 0&#215;3400001,<br />
    root 0&#215;1a6, subw 0&#215;3400002, time 1848943, (42,37), root:(1751,59),<br />
    state 0&#215;0, keycode 146 (keysym 0xff6a, <strong>Help</strong>), same_screen YES,<br />
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:<br />
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:<br />
    XFilterEvent returns: False
</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that I saw a &#8220;Help&#8221; event rather than &#8220;XF86_Switch_VT_1&#8243; was what made me suspicious. Sure enough, activating the &#8220;F-Lock&#8221; key then triggered this event:</p>
<blockquote><p>
KeyRelease event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0&#215;3400001,<br />
    root 0&#215;1a6, subw 0&#215;3400002, time 2873229, (38,51), root:(1747,73),<br />
    state 0xc, keycode 67 (keysym 0&#215;1008fe01, <strong>XF86_Switch_VT_1</strong>), same_screen YES,<br />
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:<br />
    XFilterEvent returns: False
</p></blockquote>
<p>and life was good. You might also consider <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2007/05/msg00033.html">tweaking xmodmap to return the values you expect</a>. Or you might have a <a href="http://pigeonsnest.co.uk/stuff/sarge/vtswitch.html">strange XkbModel or XkbLayout setting where switching your keyboard language or layout</a> (e.g. from pc105 to pc104) might help.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I got these <a href="http://www.whatonearthcatalog.com/whatonearth/Item_Reindeer-Car-Antlers_AV8512_ps_srm.html">reindeer car antlers</a> for my wife. This year she let me have them for my car. They look like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/reindeer-car-antlers.jpg" alt="Reindeer car antlers" /></center></p>
<p>(Note: this is the picture from the catalog, not one of our cars.)</p>
<p>Tons of people stop, stare, and then break out in a smile or start pointing out my car to friends as I drive by with my sleek reindeer antlers and big red nose. The antlers slide onto your windows, which then shut securely. That means you don&#8217;t need to worry about antler-theft in a parking lot or losing an antler as you scoot down the highway at 65 miles an hour. You may need to pay attention if you roll down your window at a McDonald&#8217;s drivethrough though.</p>
<p>I ordered mine from <a href="http://www.whatonearthcatalog.com/whatonearth/Item_Reindeer-Car-Antlers_AV8512_ps_srm.html">What on Earth</a> and they&#8217;ve worked great. Lots of fun and highly recommended.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some tips to help you get the most out of Google&#8217;s new Mobile Application for the iPhone.</p>
<ol>
<li>To get Google Mobile App on your iPhone, go to the App Store and search for &#8220;Google Mobile App,&#8221; or click on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284815942&#038;mt=8">this link</a> to install from a computer. If you have an older version of Google Mobile App installed, you might want to uninstall the older version before installing the newer version.</li>
<li>Voice recognition is turned off by default for non-U.S. users. To enable voice recognition, click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab at the bottom of the screen and slide &#8220;Voice Search&#8221; to ON.</li>
<li>If you hold the iPhone up to your ear and don&#8217;t hear the &#8220;baBUM&#8221; sound to start talking, swing the iPhone down and back up to your ear. Sometimes a little wrist flick helps to tell the iPhone you want to search.</li>
<li>You can search things besides Google&#8217;s main web index. Do a regular query such as [daffodil pictures]:
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/daffodil-pictures1.jpg" alt="Daffodil pictures" /></center></p>
<p>then press on the magnifying glass near the top left corner to bring up other options to search. By default you&#8217;re searching iPhone and Web, but you can also search Maps, Images, News, Shopping, or Wikipedia:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/daffodil-pictures2.jpg" alt="Daffodil pictures" /></center></p>
<p>Press an option like Images and the application will immediately redo the query:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/daffodil-pictures3.jpg" alt="Daffodil pictures" /></center></li>
<li>If you want to go straight to the onscreen keyboard, you can tap the &#8220;Search&#8221; tab at the bottom of the screen twice.</li>
<li>Searching with the keyboard can be very handy. As you type, the application will suggest contacts, websites, previous searches, and related query suggestions:
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/outback-steakhouse1.jpg" alt="Outback Steakhouse" /></center></p>
<p>and do you see those query suggestions in the middle of the screen? You can slide/flick them to get more suggestions:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/outback-steakhouse2.jpg" alt="Outback Steakhouse" /></center></li>
<li>The &#8220;Apps&#8221; tab at the bottom of the screen is a one-stop shop to get to all your Google services easily, including Google Apps versions of services:
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/apps-tab.jpg" alt="Apps tab" /></center></li>
<li>You can use Google Mobile App with multiple Google Apps accounts. In the Settings tab, click on Domain. Then you can add multiple domains, separated by commas.</li>
<li>Google has posted <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/topic.py?topic=15662">HTML documentation for Google Mobile App</a> and also provides a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-mobile-help">Google Mobile Help discussion group</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Bonus tip #1</strong>: If the voice recognition is close, you can press on the green query in the search box to see other possible queries. For example, if you said [background gradients in css] and got this search query:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/refine-search1.jpg" alt="Refining query" /></center></p>
<p>Notice that the query was recognized as &#8220;gradient&#8221; instead of &#8220;gradients&#8221; with an &#8217;s&#8217;. So I pressed the green query and saw other possible queries:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/refine-search2.jpg" alt="Refining query" /></center></p>
<p>My desired query was the second choice. <img src='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip #2</strong>: If you want to understand what your cat is trying to say to you, start the voice recognition and just hold it up to their mouth as they meow. Then Google will try to convert the meow into regular English text. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/sharding/status/1010833347">Sean Harding</a> for this tip.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a very good feeling about <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2008/11/just-say-it-searching-by-voice-with-new.html">Google&#8217;s new iPhone app that does voice recognition</a>. I&#8217;ve been playing with this voice recognition application for several weeks and I have to say that I&#8217;m really impressed. First and foremost, the <strong>voice recognition works really well</strong>. Crazy long-tail specialized vocabulary is tricky (more on that later), but for queries with normal words in them, the voice recognition is really accurate and I think it will get even better. You can say &#8220;population of Troy, New York&#8221; and you&#8217;re pretty likely to get good search results:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google-mobile-app1.jpg" alt="Google Mobile App: [population of troy new york]" /></center></p>
<p>I like the slick interface, because all you have to do is start the app. When you want to do a search, <strong>just hold the iPhone to your ear</strong>. The iPhone&#8217;s accelerometer senses the movement and makes a &#8220;baBUM&#8221; noise to let you know when to talk. Then just say a query like [daffodil pictures] or whatever. It&#8217;s much smoother to experience than it is to write down. The net effect is as if you had some kind of <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/star-trek-communicator-replica/">Star Trek communicator device</a>, except powered by Google instead of Spock and the rest of the crew.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really impressed with the team that worked on this. They pulled this together in a very short time and they&#8217;ve produced an extremely polished application. Every time I&#8217;ve emailed someone with feedback or a question, they replied quickly, but also thoughtfully. It&#8217;s clear to me that this application is a labor of love and they want it to be outstanding. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they do next; maybe the application can start to learn your specific voice and its inflections?</p>
<p>Do you remember <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004675.php">Battelle</a> and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/12/web-20-compact-definition-tryi.html">O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s definition of Web 2.0</a>? At the risk of mangling it, they define Web 2.0 as &#8220;applications that harness collective intelligence (either implicitly or explicitly) to get better as people use them.&#8221; <strong>I expect the voice recognition of Google&#8217;s search app to get better as people use it</strong>, much in the same way that the intent of <a href="http://www.google.com/goog411/">GOOG-411</a> was <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-12-17-n30.html">partially to improve our text-to-speech models.</a></p>
<p>The last thing I like is subtle. <strong>This app has changed the way that I do queries</strong>. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I&#8217;m a huge search geek. I&#8217;m hyperaware of when my query habits change, and I notice myself much more likely to do off-the-cuff queries such as [what's the average price per square foot for carpet?] or [how many miles per gallon do Audis get?] or [what is a softshell jacket?] or [what does the 11-99 foundation stand for?]. Marissa Mayer <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html">once kept a diary of all the searches she wanted to do during one day</a>, and mentioned about 20 queries that came to mind. I feel like I had almost that many queries just driving into work. This app lowers the bar to doing searches. For a few days I was like a five-year-old just doing queries as they popped into my head. The easier/faster it is to search, the more I searched.</p>
<p>Not only have I started to do more queries, but I also say longer, more natural-language queries. Why? Because the more contextual clues I can give to the voice recognition engine, the better it will do. So a query like [mount everest elevation feet] might work, but [how high is mount everest] is more likely to be recognized (in my limited experience). The way you formulate queries is different when you&#8217;re speaking compared to when you type. I&#8217;m still pondering the implications of that.</p>
<p>Is the app perfect? Of course not. Right now it keeps a history of my last six queries. Personally, I&#8217;d like to keep all my queries so I can go back and find previous searches. And the voice recognition, while very solid, will continue to improve over time. I&#8217;d also love a way to add my own personal vocabulary of terms such as &#8220;PageRank&#8221; or &#8220;webspam&#8221; (which currently comes up as webcam). So the app will improve, but I still feel like I have K.I.T.T. from <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Knight_Rider/">Knight Rider</a> in my pocket a lot of the time.</p>
<p>The first time you hold a phone up to your ear and just say &#8220;18 percent of 33 dollars&#8221; and get a Google calculator answer back that it&#8217;s 5.94 dollars, it&#8217;s an epiphany. Now I don&#8217;t need a tip calculator application; I just talk to my phone and it tells me to leave a six dollar tip:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google-mobile-app2.jpg" alt="Google Mobile App: [population of troy new york]" /></center></p>
<p>You may have a similar epiphany when you say the phrase &#8220;miles per gallon&#8221; and the app knows to type &#8220;mpg&#8221; or you say &#8220;one hundred and seventy-six&#8221; and the app returns &#8220;176.&#8221;</p>
<p>That rocks, and it feels like just the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential. Imagine if you had voice &#8220;bookmarks&#8221; like &#8220;Go to my email&#8221; or &#8220;Bring up today&#8217;s calendar&#8221; and you&#8217;d automatically see which room your next meeting was in. I think this will be a fun application. <img src='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> If you have an iPhone, take it for a test drive yourself: go to the App Store and search for &#8220;Google Mobile App,&#8221; then try it out. If you have iTunes installed, you can also click on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284815942&#038;mt=8">this link</a> to install from your computer. Oh, and if you&#8217;re a non-U.S. user, the app turns off voice search by default. To enable voice recognition, just click on &#8220;Settings&#8221; and slide the &#8220;Voice Search&#8221; setting to ON.</p>
<p>Read other people&#8217;s impressions of the new application over on <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/081117/p138#a081117p138">Techmeme</a>, if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
