			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not exactly a Happy Camper Holidaze season coming up, huh?  The mortgage meltdown, the credit crunch, rising unemployment and rising costs, it’s no wonder folks have wrapped their fists around their hard-earned and diminishing resources, painfully aware of every copper penny they let slip through their grasp.  Gotta keep a roof over our heads, wheels beneath our feet, food on the table and heat in the space between the walls.  We could be jobless tomorrow.  There ain’t no bucks to spare for no stinkin’ holidaze presents.  </p>
<p>While a healthy dose of fear is a good thing, if you up the dose too high, it becomes paralyzing. </p>
<p>So, I had this idea a couple of nights back and I’m going to toss it out there.  Could work.  Especially if I could get enough folks to participate in the plan.  Might even send a message up the food chain to the ones who ain’t suffering.  And it could help out a neighbor or a friend.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to do is trim that holidaze buying list way down this year.  Keep it close: your wife or husband, boyfriend or girlfriend, son or daughter.  Your grandkids, if quite young, ain’t gonna miss it but that’s your decision, and Aunt Milly in Idaho can wait until times get better.  Hell, Aunt Milly in Idaho is probably tightening her budget and trimming you from her holidaze list as I write this.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you don’t need to buy five presents for everyone on your trimmed-down holidaze list.  One will be fine and certainly better than nothing at all.  It’s the act of giving that counts, remember, not the number of gifts given.  And it doesn’t have to be some high-priced item either.  A well chosen book, a thoughtful piece of jewelry, a warm sweater, a CD you yourself would never listen to but something your son would go ape over, we’re talking under twenty bucks per present here.  And whatever you do, don’t use a credit card to buy the items.  The credit card companies don’t give a damn about you so why give them a present?</p>
<p>Ok, if you’re still with me here and psyched up to go to it, let me throw a couple of caveats your way.</p>
<p>First: The government doesn’t give a damn what happens to you, especially now that the election is over.  We’ve flexed the one tiny muscle we have with our vote and anyone who believes the bums we’ve elected are going to act substantially different than the bums we threw out is sadly delusional.  To the government we are but a tax target, a source of revenue to bail out the Fat Cats on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Second: Corporate America doesn’t give a damn what happens to you.  You’re nothing more than an advertising target and a source of revenue to pay their CEOs and upper echelon staff obscene amounts of money while laying off the real workers in the company. </p>
<p>So who loves ya, baby?  Well, I don’t know if they love ya, but the local neighborhood retailers in your area sure as hell need you right now.  Think about it.  The guy who runs the local bakery, the woman who owns the local independent bookstore, these are your neighbors and <strong><em>we are all we have left to give a damn about each other</em></strong>.  If sales are bad at WalMart or B&#038;N do you honestly think the upper echelon of those companies are going to suffer?  Not unless you think a five million dollar bonus instead of ten is suffering.  </p>
<p>But, if sales are bad at the local bookstore, the little jewelry shop up the street, that cute little second-hand place around the corner, those folks are gonna hurt and hurt bad.  They may have to close their doors.  If just one out of every tenth person who reads this bought a gift from a local retailer, it may not be a boom year for them, but they may be able to squeak by.  Isn’t that worth something?</p>
<p>So, here’s my proposal.  Take it for what it’s worth.  Thumb your nose at Corporate America.  Just say no to Amazon and Barnes &#038; Noble, to the big-box stores like WalMart and Home Depot, to the chains and the franchises with home offices in cities you wouldn’t visit in a million years and probably couldn’t find on a map.</p>
<p>Buy local!  Want a book?  Check out the independent bookstore in your town.  Jewelry, clothing, music or video, I’m sure there’s a local, independent retailer in your area.  Check out the local craft fairs, the second-hand stores, the tiny restaurant you’ve been driving past for the last few years, the little coffee shop hidden around the corner, the home town bakery down near the railroad tracks.  Keep your hard earned cash at home where it will do the most good.</p>
<p>On a side note, as an author, I have a special interest in books and I happen to know that authors, especially debut authors, are hurting like the rest of us.  It’s hard enough being a debut author, folks are wary of buying into an author they know nothing about, but in these fearful financial times it’s gotten even harder.  So, here’s an addition to my proposal: Thumb your nose at Patterson and Clancy, Rowling and King and go for a debut author.  I’m not passing judgment on the above authors, not at all, hell, I love Rowling and King, but let me tell ya, they don’t need the money half as much as that newly published author does and, more importantly, if that debut author is ever to see a second book of theirs on the shelf, they have sales numbers to meet before that will happen.  The publishing industry is a brutal master.</p>
<p>I usually don’t give much thought to how many folks, if any, actually read my blog posts.  I do this as much for myself as for garnering an audience.  But this is different.  I think this is an important issue and I’d love to see it blown across the blogesphere.  I’d love to see other bloggers take up the cause, write their own posts from their own perspective, linking one to the other in a giant web and, as I plan to do below, give out a few recommendations for items to buy and places to buy them in their own city or town.</p>
<p>C’mon, we can do this.  <strong>And we’re the only ones who give a damn enough to do it</strong>.  Help your neighbor.  Help your neighborhood.  Help your local artist.  Buy Local! </p>
<p>At the moment, I’m in Albuquerque, New Mexico and here are a couple of suggestions of things to buy and places to buy them.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A <em>few</em> recommended books</strong> (if I went all out, you’d be reading this post forever):  </p>

<p>Many of the shops in Old Town and don’t forget to check out the independent sellers with their wares laid out on the sidewalk.  Some good values there.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, if you like what you’ve read here, send a link to everyone you know or, if you’re a blogger, write your own post and link back to me.  Let’s pitch this idea to the whole world.  </p>
<p>Save a retailer - Buy Local!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.ejknapp.com/OnlyOnSunday/wp-content/themes/knapp01/images/booth.jpg" style="border: 0pt none; float:left;  padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px" height="200" width="125" />He showed up at the kitchen door at the house in Guerneville in 1996.  He could be cantankerous and at times a bit of a bully but I remember a time, a dark time, that his crackling meow, much like the sound glass might make in cracking, kept me in the here and now instead of the hereafter.  12 years he&#8217;s been with me.  I have no idea how many years he&#8217;d been with himself before that.  I&#8217;ve gone through many a trial and tribulation in those years; job stress, a near fatal car crash, the loss of my job, the near loss of my house and a long trip to Albuquerque that he hated every moment of, financial disintegration, a near loss of hope and through it all he&#8217;s been there.  </p>
<p>He grew old, cast aside his bully ways, became something of a grandpa to the three sisters, the little kittens my kitten quite accidentally had.  He had a stroke several months back and I thought we&#8217;d lose him then but he fought his way back.  A little jerky in his walk, his meow even hoarser than before, a bit of a space cadet at times but he learned to get around, to climb up on the bed and settle down in his favorite spot.  </p>
<p>But age will take you down, no one gets out of here alive.  And I swore I wouldn&#8217;t let him suffer.</p>
<p>Booth went to Blue at 4:30 today.  I am thankful to Dr. Walker of Cat Clinic for her kind and gentle ways and to Scott for the ride.</p>
<p>Gone to Blue.  There is no more pain.  No chance of suffering.  He&#8217;s gone to be with Asher who he never knew, with Mooch and Feral who he tangled with from time to time, the Doubtful Guest and Smokey and Dinger who were all a little on the weird side and scared him a bit, with Puss and Pug, the Albuquerque cats who he never got along with well but respected their territorial rights, all cats who have crossed his and my path these last 12 years and Gone to Blue themselves.  And I know Neb and Pink and Treacle will be there as well, though he may not find the company of dogs as enjoyable as those of the cats.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s time for me to go, I want to go where they&#8217;ve gone.</p>
<p><center><br />
To live in this world<br />
you must be able<br />
to do three things:<br />
to love what is mortal;<br />
to hold it against your bones knowing<br />
your own life depends on it;<br />
and, when the time comes to let it go,<br />
to let it go.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><em>Lather was thirty years old today,<br />
They took away all of his toys.<br />
His mother sent newspaper clippings to him,<br />
About his friends who had stopped being boys.</em></center></p>
<p>Way back when I was getting-old as opposed to actually being old, 30 was this big-deal, black magic moment which, once past, meant you could no longer be trusted.  I suppose, considering the rampant avarice and greed leading to the current financial meltdown, that was a prophetic idea.  </p>
<p>I remember the several days leading up to that momentous event were fraught with anxiety mixed with a curious calm.  Would the planet split open and swallow me whole?  Would I cut my hair, don a suit and tie and go forth into the business world?  Would my younger friends suddenly shun me?  Would I be beamed aboard the starship and whisked away from this veil of tears?  Though I fervently hoped for the latter, none of it happened.  As the old saying goes, 30 came and went, not with a bang but a whimper.  </p>
<p>50, now, was a totally different thing.  Never mind 40.  40 I don&#8217;t even remember except for the fact that my hair went nearly completely white and I finally gave in to wearing glasses at 42.  50, however, was evil incarnate for reasons I&#8217;ve never explored.  I couldn&#8217;t even say &#8216;50&#8242; until I was damn near 52.</p>
<p>50 has not been kind to me.</p>
<p>60?  60 is proving to be a bit of a mixed bag of cheap tricks.  First and foremost, I never ever thought I&#8217;d make it this far, all things considered.  Now that I&#8217;m here, I find it both mildly humorous and somewhat pathetic.  I&#8217;m certainly not where I thought I&#8217;d be, if I ever actually gave where I thought I&#8217;d be any thought.  There are moments when I actually wish I was 2.5 years older so I could just do the social security thing and be done with this working thing but that probably wouldn&#8217;t work.    </p>
<p>I hate being this old.  I hate the aches and the pains and the growing sense of vulnerability.  I hate that there is a 30 year old inside who thinks he can still do 30 year old things only to find that this 60 year old body protests.  I hate that my hair, though still as long as ever, is thinning and that my teeth are getting loose in their sockets.  I hate looking in the mirror and not recognizing the person staring back at me.  I hate that I can&#8217;t eat a big bowl of ice cream drowning in chocolate syrup, or extra extra hot chili, or any number of things I once enjoyed.</p>
<p>Is there anything I like about 60?  I&#8217;m not sure yet, though I sense that there is.  I smell something in the wind, perceive the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, though my natural pessimism tells me that wind, that light, is just that damn train again.  Still, there are moments when I get a kick out of the idea of turning 60.  Like maybe now I can just be a coot, an old fart, and finally get away with not giving a shit.  </p>
<p><center><em>But Lather still finds it a nice thing to do,<br />
To lie about nude in the sand,<br />
Drawing pictures of mountains that look like bumps<br />
And thrashing the air with his hands.</em></center> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting for the starship, though.  Sure do wish it would get here.  Winter&#8217;s coming and I&#8217;m growing impatient.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you may be asking yourself what publishing and plugins have in common.  Well, nothing really, except I have news about both.  I was just kind of stuck for a title for this post and liked the idea of the double p sound.</p>
<p>First, the publishing part.  My story <em>The Dance</em> has finally found a home.  This is one of my favorite stories and I&#8217;ve had a devil of a time getting it published.  Not, IMHO, because it&#8217;s poorly written, but due to a problem I seem to have with many of my stories, and novels, come to think of it.  Namely, what the hell genre is it?</p>
<p>When I first started sending it out, I sent it to places that took mainstream fiction.  They sent it back saying they didn&#8217;t accept romance.  Romance?  Well, I suppose one could see <em>The Dance</em> as a romance.  I didn&#8217;t really think of it that way but what do I know?  So, I sent it to some places that accepted romance.  Guess what?  They rejected it because it wasn&#8217;t a romance.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>Anyway, I let it sit for a long spell after that as I had a lot of other things going on.  Recently, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.duotrope.com/index.aspx">Duotrope&#8217; Digest</a>.  What a great source that site is.  I researched a number of publications, making a small favorites list and started sending out some of my stories.  I remembered <em>The Dance</em> and figured, what the hell, and I found a place that might be interested, sent it their way, and heard this past Friday that they were interested.  Whooopee!</p>
<p>So, <em>The Dance</em> will be published in the December issue of <a href="http://www.vagabondagepress.com/">The Battered Suitcase</a>.  I&#8217;ll post a link when it&#8217;s online.</p>
<p>Ok, so what about plugins?  Well, as every writer knows, writing means never having dirty dishes, which is another way of saying that writers tend to get distracted when they&#8217;re suppose to be writing.  This happened to me this weekend.  I started thinking how cool it would be to know what authors were born on the current day.  I figured there had to be a plugin for such a thing.  Hell, there are plugins for most everything you can imagine.  But nope, no plugin, so I decided to write one.  </p>
<p>I spent a day researching and compiling a list of authors and their birthdays and started formating the list.  I wrote a basic program to create the database, populate it and display the current day&#8217;s birthdays in a blog sidebar.  I&#8217;m about midway through with it and plan to offer it up as soon as all the testing is done.  It only works with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> as far as I know.  But then, if you ain&#8217;t using WordPress you really ain&#8217;t blogging anyway.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple program, easy to style, and I&#8217;ll give it away and ask for a donation if the user finds it useful.  It&#8217;s over there in my sidebar.  No birthdays listed yet cause I&#8217;ve only formated up to July so far.  It&#8217;s a big list and I plan on adding some writers I know to it.  Look for a finished product in about a week or so.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Mr. EJ</p>
<p>Thank you for the submission of your manuscript.  Though the work is skillfully crafted and the writing superb, I fear I must pass.  Were this a work of Science Fiction, which I do not represent, it&#8217;s possible you could find a market but, as mainstream fiction, I fear it hasn&#8217;t a chance.  The characters and plot line are simply implausible.</p>
<p>A presidential candidate, a former prisoner of war, who advocates war and torture?  A female running mate with scant political experience, who&#8217;s proud to be a hockey-mom and has a husband who refers to himself as first dude?  These characters are so unrealistic as to be absurd.</p>
<p>Further, although the economical structure of any country is complicated and in constant flux and, to be sure, there is a great deal of greed involved, the level to which your novel portrays the financial situation is, well, to be honest, it&#8217;s simply beyond believability.  A housing market in disarray, CEOs of failed companies being given millions in bonuses, major financial institutions failing, a 750 billion dollar bailout from the government that will only enhance the rich and leave the taxpayer with nothing?  No one would believe such a scenario.</p>
<p>You are obviously a talented writer but your imagination may have gotten away from you on this one.  </p>
<p>Please do keep me in mind for your next endeavor.  </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Big Time Agent</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Has anyone else noticed the massive fear campaign directed at us by the media?  It would seem the Rich and Greedy have nuzzled up with their political mouthpieces and are now in the process of trying to scare the hell out of us with their lies and innuendo. </p>
<p>C&#8217;mon, guys, give it a rest, will ya.  You&#8217;ve been sucking the system dry for years, collecting your ridiculous salaries and obscene bonuses while running the companies into the ground.  You walk away with millions and a whole lot of poor working folks end up losing what little they have and queuing up at the food line.  Well, loath as I am to use a cliché, the chickens be coming home to roost.  </p>
<p>You&#8217;re out there trying to scare us into thinking that our failure to support this staggering level of corporate welfare will somehow force the banks to stop lending which in turn could jeopardize company payrolls, car loans, mortgage loans, college loans, even, and I find this so absurd, cause people&#8217;s FICO scores to go down.  Man, you all are getting desperate, huh?  </p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s a thought for ya: if people&#8217;s FICO scores are going to go down over this, why don&#8217;t we just really screw the scores and call a general strike: stop paying those mortgages, those auto and student loans, rip up those credit cards and toss the next credit card bill in the trash.  We might go down but you&#8217;d go down with us and that, IMHO, would be cool.    </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to admit I know little about economics but I do know this: If a bank loans me a dollar, that dollar is making money for the bank.  If they don&#8217;t loan me that dollar, they make nothing.  So please, don&#8217;t hand me your crap about financial collapse.  If I don&#8217;t have the dollar, I&#8217;ll get by.  Been poor a long time.  I may not like it but I&#8217;m used to it.  Are you?</p>
<p>This is High Noon, Shoot-out at the OK Corral.  I just hope there are enough of us brave enough to stare you all down.  By and by you&#8217;ll loan the money that needs to be loaned.  After all, ya gotta pay the payments on those multiple dwellings you own and, you know, those high-end autos need a lot of maintenance, and jet fuel for the Lear, I mean, have you seen the cost of that stuff?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I just read an interesting article by Michael Moore: &#8220;<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?id=235">The Rich Are Staging a Coup This Morning</a>&#8220;.  I think he may be on to something there.  Hey, every despot who&#8217;s been forced out of office loots the treasury on the way out the door.  Our despot is getting close to the end of his term.  Sure looks like that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s doing here.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a time in my youth when Nixon was evil incarnate, a time when I honestly expected tanks to roll down the street and marshal law to be declared, a time when hair past your collar would be grounds for imprisonment or worse.</p>
<p>I am older now and supposedly wiser and I&#8217;d take old Tricky Dick back in a heartbeat.  Jumpin&#8217; Jackboots, Batman, there&#8217;s a plague loose across the land.  Is this really America, the land of the free, home of the brave or have I, in my advancing addled state, fallen through some interdimensional crack into another reality?  </p>
<p>First Dude?  Are we seriously involved in an election where one side has picked a running mate who claims she&#8217;s proud to be a hockey mom and her husband refers to himself as First Dude?  I swear, if I wrote a novel based around two such characters and circumstances, I&#8217;d be the laughing stock of  every agent I sent it to.  I could wallpaper a mansion with the rejection slips I&#8217;d garner.  I mean, this scenario is beyond the pale of fiction.  Stephen King couldn&#8217;t write this and get it published. </p>
<p>$750,000,000,000 to bail out a bunch of greedy, filthy rich, conscienceless, immoral assholes?  People are losing their homes.  The bridges in this country are falling apart.  The roads are in severe disrepair.  Our schools are hovels.  Our children are being left way way way behind the rest of the world but lordy lordy can they take a test.  We don&#8217;t have to jump on a plane and fly to Africa or South America to see a Third World country.  All we need to do is walk out our door because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re becoming.  And I think those greedy, filthy rich, conscienceless, immoral assholes like that idea just fine.</p>
<p>$3,000,000,000,000 to blow up a country that was no threat to us just to kill a guy we supported when we thought we could use him.  How many men and women, Iraqi and American, British and French and those from whatever other country foolish enough to involve themselves in Bush&#8217;s Folly,  have died so Bush&#8217;s greedy, filthy rich, conscienceless, immoral asshole friends could line their pockets with weapon sales, reconstruction and oil money.  And how many enemies have we made in the process.  Bush&#8217;s Folly was perhaps the greatest incentive to join a terrorist organization ever inflicted on the world.  We are going to be hated, HATED!, for a long, long time by people who have every right in the world to hate us.  Way to go on winning those hearts and minds, W!</p>
<p>And where the fuck is the media when Johnny comes home in a body bag?  Where is the media period?  Bunch of fucking wimps.  Freedom of the press my ass.  We haven&#8217;t had freedom of the press since the Vietnam war.  The powers that be learned a valuable lesson back then.  Dumb down America, keep everyone scared and use the advertising dollar to effectively circumvent the First Amendment. </p>
<p>But there is a far bigger loss.  Pogo said it, long ago, and it holds true today: We have met the enemy and he is us.  Collectively we have more than enough anger and more than enough clout to bring these greedy, filthy rich, conscienceless, immoral assholes to their knees.  But do we do anything about it?  Do we take to the streets?  Burn down the house?  Refuse to buy their overpriced wares.  Refuse to buy into lie after lie after bloody lie?  No, we keep filling up our tanks and cheer when they scream &#8216;drill, baby, drill&#8217; like that&#8217;s going to solve anything.  Hate to break it to ya but if they started drilling today we wouldn&#8217;t see that crude make it to the pump for at least 10 years and by that time 4 bucks a gallon is going to seem really cheap.  And here&#8217;s another little tid-bit for you to consider: We be running out of oil.  Period.  Gone.  Nada.  No more sticky goop.</p>
<p>We buy their genetically altered food, their hormone ridden milk, their overpriced goods and services, pay outrageous taxes and get nothing, NOTHING, in return.  Our jobs are far from stable and if we get laid off we get squat, regardless of how conscientious we may have been.  Some CEO totally screws a company, hundreds, thousands lose their jobs and he walks away with mega-millions in his pocket. We buy the politicos&#8217; bullshit and vote for them only to be butt-fucked again and again and when the time comes round again for more lies, we buy into those all over again.</p>
<p>What the Fuck is wrong with this country and why is no one rising up to smite the greedy, filthy rich, conscienceless, immoral assholes that are running it into the ground.</p>
<p>This is definitely NOT my beautiful country.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been on a roll lately and haven&#8217;t had the time for the blog that I would like.  But then, from the total lack of comments I get and noticing in my stat program that most of the hits I do get are coming from spammers, I suppose it doesn&#8217;t make much difference how frequently or infrequently I update this thing.  I do love my spam killer, though.  Nothing gets through.</p>
<p>Anyway, I finished my story <em>The Karaoke Singer</em> for the latest Backspace contest on the day it was due.  There were a number of better stories but it still came in at the 4th or 5th position.  Not bad for a story I wrote and edited in a day.  As much as I enjoy entering the contests and certainly winning is a real ego boost, I have to say it&#8217;s mixed blessing.  I really hate coming up with the parameters for the next contest.  I&#8217;m much more comfortable writing to someone else&#8217;s parameters.</p>
<p>I polished the story up, made a few changes and sent it out.  I also pulled a few other stories out of the bin, some that were ready to go and some that needed work, did what needed to be done and sent them out as well.  I&#8217;ve got one story, <em>Fire and Slush</em> that I&#8217;m looking for a market for.  It&#8217;s going to be tough sell as it&#8217;s really a writers story but I&#8217;ll keep trying.</p>
<p>In any event, the following stories are out and about: <em>The Karaoke Singer, Final Target, The Dance</em> and <em>Plugging The Pooch</em>.  Wish me luck.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I&#8217;ve been struggling with this toothache.  Funny how those things seem always to happen on weekends, and a long weekend to boot in this case, when if you&#8217;re unwilling to hit the ER about all you can do is suck it up and slog through it until regular business hours come rolling around again.  All in all it kind of proves my point that life can be a sadistic little bitch at times.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been sipping soup, blah, and trying to sleep, impossible, and generally watching the moments crawl by on shackled feet.  I think they were humming a dirge as they passed.  I tried getting some writing done at one point but that didn&#8217;t work at all.  Hard to be creative when it feels like someone is driving a dull nail up through your jawbone.</p>
<p>Desperate to pass the time, I thought I might find something to read.  I can usually tune out most anything, even pain, if the read is engaging enough.  There was nothing new on my to-be-read pile and no way was I going to attempt to ride my bicycle down to the bookstore so I spent several frustrating minutes looking through my stack of already read books and came away with the perfect one.</p>
<p><div id="item">
<div class="image"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eighth-Grade-Bites-Chronicles-Vladimir/dp/0142411876%3FSubscriptionId%3D1RV5TDVXMVTRBHN6GS82%26tag%3Donlyonsunday-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0142411876"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zopMVb1yL._SL160_.jpg" border="0" alt="Eighth Grade Bites (Chronicles of Vladimir Tod, Book 1)"></a></div>
</div>
<p>I first read Heather Brewer&#8217;s <em><strong>Eighth Grade Bites, The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod</strong></em> a few months back and remember it as an enjoyable read.  Heather, who is one of the original members of what was then the fledgling writers forum Backspace, was one of the first virtual friends I connected with there when I joined some nine months after the its inception.  Man that seems like a long time ago.  </p>
<p>Backspace was small in those days with membership hovering around a hundred struggling writers.  Things were looser then, maybe a bit wilder.  Heather and I clicked for some reason.  Maybe it had something to do with our willingness to push the envelope every chance we got.  It may be because we were both horrible flirts.  Whatever the reason, it was a time of great fun.  I kind of miss the crazy antics we shared in the same way I miss the old Backspace but change is rarely something you can stop.  Backspace got bigger, more popular, more professional and more serious.  It&#8217;s by no means devoid of humor now, mind you, but it has gotten tamer.</p>
<p>Anyway, rereading EGB was the best choice I could have made.  It didn&#8217;t make the toothache disappear but it certainly forced it into the background of my consciousness for long periods of time.</p>
<p>What a hell of a charming book EGB is, and a wry, witty and well written book to boot.  Heather has captured with near perfection that angst any teenager of any generation feels.  EGB has strong, well developed characters, especially in the case of Vladimir Todd, an intriguing mystery, and one liners that zing right off the page and make you laugh out loud.  Which, I am loath to admit, is not a particularly good thing when your lower jaw is swollen to the size of a golf ball.  Still, laughter is strong medicine and endorphins are the bodies own pain killers.  I <strong>Do Not</strong>, however, recommend you read EGB while sipping coffee at your computer.  You will find yourself out shopping for a new keyboard.  </p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a Young Adult in age or mental attitude, you&#8217;ll love this book.  And be sure to check out Heather&#8217;s <a href="http://www.heatherbrewer.com/bleedingink/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and Heather, the blood and chocolate chip cookie thing was wonderfully over the top.  To steal a line from our beloved Stella, You Rock!</p>
