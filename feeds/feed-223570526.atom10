Many of its leaders are on the road constantly presenting about why their organizations came to be, what strategies they use to understand the root causes of their diseases, and what they are doing to support translational research. This was the central question of an &lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3740/35684/57121.aspx"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM) Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders&lt;/a&gt; meeting in early October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SSq4CkV7qxI/AAAAAAAAACM/QYYi3d7oaWU/s1600-h/FastercuresWP_052808_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272228668045503250" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 112px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 131px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SSq4CkV7qxI/AAAAAAAAACM/QYYi3d7oaWU/s200/FastercuresWP_052808_thumbnail.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we work with many of these &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/index.cfm/OurPrograms/InnovationTRAIN/Participating_Groups"&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt; through our &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/index.cfm/OurPrograms/InnovationTRAIN/Innovation_-_The_Redstone_Acceleration_and_Innovation_Network"&gt;TRAIN&lt;/a&gt; initiative. We released the &lt;a href="http://fastercures.org/objects/pdfs/white_papers/FastercuresWP_Innovation_052808.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Entrepreneurs for Cures”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that articulates the reason many of these groups were formed: that their only bottom line is curing disease and improving the lives of patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/?id=57131"&gt;IOM meeting&lt;/a&gt;, some of the problems in reaching cures were restated before the group dove in to the various approaches and models that the venture philanthropy groups use to move the needle. The statistics about drug development are a stark reminder of the enormous challenges facing biomedical research and the quest for faster cures. Despite increasing knowledge and investment in R&amp;amp;D spending, drug registrations are falling and the investment costs per successful drug launch has escalated in recent years. For many diseases, treatments – let alone advances – are few and far between. The ‘valley of death’ in drug development is a story that venture philanthropy groups know all too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tag lines for the meeting could have been “Focus, Focus, Focus” with a healthy dose of “If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.” Two themes that are particularly poignant in today’s economic climate. With each day’s headlines of the stock market tumbling to new lows, there is a greater sense of uncertainty about how this will impact medical research philanthropy. Groups need to be laser-focused, and they need to have an action plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dick Insel of the &lt;a href="http://www.jdrf.org/"&gt;Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that doing this work requires that you know your product, partners, and yourself to be effective. Expectations between partners need to be aligned. In terms of knowing yourself, he pointed out the importance of managing expectations with donors and the patient community, and also the balance between hope versus hype in doing disease research. Sophia Colamarino of &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; described how patients and in the case of autism, the parents of patients have to be brought into the research process and need translation services. And when there are accomplishments, they have to be given credit too. Everyone agreed that knowledge needs to be constantly pushed out to many audiences in order to move closer to the goal. The scientific community needs it, industry needs it, and of course patients need information to know how new findings get mapped against the search for cures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Hood of the &lt;a href="http://www.michaeljfox.org/"&gt;Michael J. Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt; spoke of how the value-add they bring is that her group is constantly looking at what worked and didn’t work, and what MJFF needs to do to increase the odds of success of what they are funding. She also noted that the valley of death is not the same for each disease, and that venture philanthropy groups need to create a roadmap. Each group should ask what unique value is of what they bring to the table, and how they can target everything towards that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These groups often talk about milestones, and the requirements they place on grantees when they get their funds. Some groups pointed to examples where they stopped or held payments. This requires active management and forecasting of the research portfolio. Some described how the goal was to bring more partners and players into their fields, and they saw their role as lowering those barriers to entry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One participant summed it up, “Nobody has the incentive to think about our disease process like we do.” Jonathan Simons of &lt;a href="http://www.michaeljfox.org/"&gt;Prostate Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt; talked about their metrics in plain and simple terms – lives saved and a reduction in the death rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone pointed out that the role of these groups is to shine a light on what is possible in disease research. Indeed they do. Next challenge, how do you spread this line of thinking and these tactics even farther? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/"&gt;READ AND COMMENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/FasterCures/23454067539"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272229559621954418" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 144px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 44px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SSq42duUq3I/AAAAAAAAACU/fe7XW30vZj8/s200/facebook.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Social and professional networks have emerged from this discipline. Medical research has been largely missing from the dialogue and the discipline, even as it seeks to address a market failure no less important than other social enterprises – the development of therapies that cure disease and alleviate suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 30 senior leaders from organizations that fund medical research and those from the broader sphere of social entrepreneurship convened a week ago at what has become an annual leadership forum on medical research innovation brought together by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esquirehouse2008.com/"&gt;Esquire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; magazine. The meeting explored what lessons have been learned by social entrepreneurs that might be applied by those pursuing what &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; calls "cure entrepreneurship," or novel approaches to accelerating the process of treating and curing disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the discussion during the day centered on the need for better information flows about what work is being done, by whom, and its quality; the need for better communication about why new approaches are needed and the promise they hold; and the need for nonprofits to find creative ways to leverage their relatively small funds into larger investments into new therapies. There was also a common focus on the centrality of patients and the transformative nature of empowering them to play a greater role in research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The social entrepreneurs and cure entrepreneurs in the room found a lot of common ground. In part because both distinct sectors function in a similar nonprofit space where success is often the result of effectively leveraging the assets that it creates. It was noted however that the social business model is difficult to achieve in medical research because of its cost implications. Throughout the day, participants alluded to the need for unconventional solutions, unusual channels to reach nontraditional audiences, outcomes-focused collaborative efforts, and ideas that could be acted on in real-time by the right people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the meeting’s location, set in a swank, &lt;em&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/em&gt;-ready mansion in Hollywood Hills triggered the right brain to yield more inspirational ideas. Perhaps it was the collective braintrust in the room that stimulated an engaged energy and infused thoughtful intrigue that are often absent in more typical conferences. Greg Simon, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures’&lt;/em&gt; president aptly set the tone when he said in his welcome remarks that “we do not need to go somewhere, we just need to be somewhere…”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, we were somewhere. It was a place where we tried to create an intersection between social entrepreneurship and medical research philanthropy – an ecosystem to support the work of cure entrepreneurs. It was a place where ideas reigned and the seemingly impossible task of challenging our biomedical research system to produce results was not a far-fetched goal. The meeting reinforced the unique role that &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; can play in helping to build a "knowledge commons" to accelerate medical research – whether that is collection of the best organizational practices of &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/index.cfm/OurPrograms/InnovationTRAIN/Innovation_-_The_Redstone_Acceleration_and_Innovation_Network"&gt;TRAIN groups&lt;/a&gt;, or continued work on the &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/index.cfm/OurPrograms/Philanthropy_Advisory_Service"&gt;Philanthropy Advisory Service&lt;/a&gt; to make transparent information about the most effective medical research foundations, or perhaps an entirely new project to escrow vetted but unfunded proposals from funders. Additionally, meeting attendees urged &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; to focus on the idea that philanthropy is a whole new capital market in need of rules and auditable facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the context we all are a part of changes dramatically by the day, last week’s meeting was a place to start, an opportunity to put some markers on important work that needs to continue if we, as a nation, are serious not just about reforming our broken healthcare system, but also about fixing our broken health &lt;em&gt;cures&lt;/em&gt; system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related Blogs:&lt;br /&gt;Common Knowledge's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2008/11/the_unknowns.php"&gt;The Unknowns&lt;/a&gt; by John Wilbanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2008/11/the_unknowns.php"&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2008/11/the_unknowns.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;embed style="WIDTH: 400px; HEIGHT: 320px" name="flashticker" align="middle" src="http://widget-59.slide.com/widgets/slideticker.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" quality="high" scale="noscale" salign="l" wmode="transparent" flashvars="cy=bb&amp;amp;il=1&amp;amp;channel=2666130979421593689&amp;amp;site=widget-59.slide.com"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; &lt;div style="WIDTH: 400px; TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=bb&amp;amp;at=fl&amp;amp;id=2666130979421593689&amp;amp;map=1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://widget-59.slide.com/p1/2666130979421593689/bb_t000_v000_s0fl_f00/images/xslide1.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=bb&amp;amp;at=fl&amp;amp;id=2666130979421593689&amp;amp;map=2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://widget-59.slide.com/p2/2666130979421593689/bb_t000_v000_s0fl_f00/images/xslide2.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=bb&amp;amp;at=fl&amp;amp;id=2666130979421593689&amp;amp;map=F" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://widget-59.slide.com/p4/2666130979421593689/bb_t000_v000_s0fl_f00/images/xslide42.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/11/from-social-entrepreneurship-to-cure.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read and Comment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

We are all walking medical record repositories for ourselves and our loved ones. And yet, patients are still the healthcare system’s largest untapped resource.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embedded within each patient is the information – medical &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SP9rMMvvOXI/AAAAAAAAACE/tHka77gSzLM/s1600-h/AA053269.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5260040747116083570" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SP9rMMvvOXI/AAAAAAAAACE/tHka77gSzLM/s200/AA053269.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;records, biological material such as tissue, blood, and DNA, and our biology as observed in clinical trials – that is crucial to understanding and managing disease. The ability to effectively preempt, accurately diagnose, and successfully treat disease relies on a patient’s willingness to provide personal genetic and medical information and to become an involved participant throughout the medical research continuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of us has experienced how patients are not at the center of healthcare. It's no surprise why patients are not chomping at the bit to participate in research – information about clinical trials is scarce and confusing, there are few incentives in exchange for your effort and time, and healthcare providers rarely provide you with the guidance and the care you need and deserve to navigate through a complex process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything has to change to put patients at the center. To make personalized medicine a reality for all, we need to transform our current health&lt;em&gt;cure&lt;/em&gt; and health&lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; systems from the outdated model of the last century to an integrated, information-based, high-quality, health-sustaining model. We need a healthcure system that engages patients from the very beginning of the research process instead of turning to patients as an afterthought. We need a healthcare system that will improve treatment options for patients, prevent the onset of disease in the first place, and improve the quality of life for generations to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to your health -- take it personally. &lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;For more information, download a copy of the just released &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; white paper &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/objects/pdfs/white_papers/Patients%20and%20Consumers%20Interests%20and%20Perspectives%20in%20Personalized%20Healthcare%20FINAL.pdf"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Patients' and Consumers' Interests and Perspectives in Personalized&lt;br /&gt;Healthcare."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt; This paper looks into the cutting-edge&lt;br /&gt;possibilities of personalized healthcare and the need for patient involvement&lt;br /&gt;and provides a glimpse into how "personal" personalized healthcare is and what&lt;br /&gt;consumers think about the advent of this era. &lt;em&gt;FasterCures &lt;/em&gt;was&lt;br /&gt;commissioned to develop this paper by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for&lt;br /&gt;Planning and Evaluation at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as&lt;br /&gt;part of Secretary Michael O.

I say millions because if you or a loved one has ever been sick or poor or hungry, Paul Rogers did a good deed for you. With a stentorian voice that seemed made in heaven, Paul Rogers advocated for this nation to make protecting the health and well-being of all of us a national imperative. The organization he loved and that loved him – &lt;a href="http://www.researchamerica.org/"&gt;Research! America&lt;/a&gt; – is the fountain from which sprang so many organizations (including &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) trying to improve the health and quality of life of all people. His work through &lt;a href="http://www.researchamerica.org/"&gt;Research!America&lt;/a&gt; to double the NIH budget will lead to cures and therapies that will affect millions. The &lt;a href="http://www.researchamerica.org/pgr_society"&gt;Paul G. Rogers Society for Global Health Research Ambassadors&lt;/a&gt; program funded by the Gates Foundation to promote awareness of global health issues will affect hundreds of millions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all could learn a thing or two from Congressman Rogers' 24-year tenure. He kept his eye on the nation's top priorities and made it his own. He helped ensure that generations of Americans have access to the best that medical science has to offer -- life-saving cancer therapies, medical devices, emergency medical care, public health programs -- and made sure that the water we drink is clean and safe and the air we breathe is free of pollutants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congressman Rogers saw the potential for improving our nation's healthcare system and worked tirelessly to turn that potential into tangible benefit for millions of Americans. He helped rally Congress to wage a war on cancer, supported increased investment in the National Institutes of Health, worked to maintain the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. More significantly, he paved the way for the biomedical research enterprise to become the most scientifically and technologically advanced system in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; team extends our sincere condolences to the family of the late Congressman Rogers and to Research!America for the loss of this great and caring man. There are few absolutes in life, but here’s one: Paul Rogers devoted his life to helping others and never asked a thing for himself. The greatest gift we can give his family and friends is to try and do that ourselves everyday.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

When it comes to biomedical science policy in the US, the names of some people with clout are obvious. But beyond the Nobel laureates and university presidents there is another set of people who wield power. Some of these influential players, such as patient advocates or experts who churn out reports for think tanks, are well known within their own communities. Others, such as Senate staffers or policy makers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), operate under the radar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

We discussed many of the exciting development occurring in the field. In addition to progress in basic research, many potential treatments are showing promise in animal studies and various stages of clinical trials. Many of the efforts targeting what scientists believe to be the causes of the disease are moving along the pipeline, and novel mechanisms of interventions are also discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting also addressed challenges in AD research. Among others, low enrollment in clinical trials was highlighted as a key challenge in transforming exciting scientific discoveries into treatments that benefit the patients. Alzheimer’s is not exactly an orphan disease—it impacts 4.5 million patients in the US today, with a drastic increase of disease burden expected. How is it possible that there are not enough clinical trial participants?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many clinical trials in Alzheimer’s target the patients in early stage of the disease, since that is when the debilitating effects of dementia, caused by the death of neurons, can be averted. However, a diagnosis is less straightforward at early stage, given that clear biomarkers of the disease are yet to be established. Even in cases where diagnosis is made early, additional challenges to clinical trial participation exist. For example, under the current system of care where primary care physicians are in charge of most Alzheimer’s patients, it is difficult to have patients enroll in clinical trials, which are conducted in more specialized healthcare centers. Trial participation may also increase the burden to the caregiver due to the need for additional visits, especially when the trial site is at a distant location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While scientists and trial administrators focus on finding solutions to this challenge by developing biomarkers for early diagnosis, reaching out to primary care physicians, educating participants on the importance of trials and developing technological solution to reduce the need for physical visits, the most important lever would be that patients and caregivers learn more about trial options, and when possible, enroll in trials. Participating in trials requires substantial effort from the patients and caregivers as well as courage to commit to a therapeutic regimen that is yet to be proved.  No other research tool can substitute for clinical trials in developing novel therapeutics. Trial participants make an invaluable contribution to medicine by making themselves available—we cannot overemphasize the fact that none of the medical breakthroughs we have today would have been realized without their contribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To highlight one trial, the &lt;a href="https://adcs.ucsd.edu/Home.htm"&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical trial network funded by the NIH, is currently recruiting participants for a trial aiming to curb the toxic effects of beta-amyloid .* This is not the only trial targeting Alzheimer’s disease—&lt;a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; lists 121 trials in the US and 216 when counted across the globe, actively recruiting participants, as of September 24, 2008. &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been highlighting clinical trial participation as a key element to accelerate medical research. I look forward to a day when an informed conversation about clinical trial participation becomes part of routine medical care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; does not endorse any specific clinical trial. Decisions on clinical trial participation should be made based on consultation with healthcare professionals.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Born out of a need to open up innovation within the pharmaceutical industry, the site is now beginning to be used by groups like the "Prize for Life" challenge to find a biomarker for ALS, and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; and the folks at InnoCentive are now embarking on an experiment together by posting an &lt;a href="http://gw.innocentive.com/ar/disciplineSearch?challenge-order-by=desc&amp;amp;challenge-sort-by=challengeNumber&amp;amp;viewMode=abstract&amp;amp;challenge-search-text=fastercures&amp;amp;challenge-search-button.x=0&amp;amp;challenge-search-button.y=0&amp;amp;challenge-search-button=Search"&gt;Ideation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; on the site, one of the company’s first "Public Policy and Citizens in Action" challenges seeking solutions to important issues facing society. We’re hoping to benefit from the "wisdom of the crowd" by asking for novel approaches and/or incentives that might induce companies to invest more in biomarkers research and qualification. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a day of posting the challenge we were pleasantly surprised to see that there were dozens of "project rooms" opened by individuals interested in possibly submitting a solution; by the end of the week there were more than a hundred. The proof will be in the pudding, of course. This sort of challenge is quite different from the ones that have become InnoCentive’s bread and butter (with apologies for mixing my food metaphors).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InnoCentive’s successes can be attention-grabbing. One example is a challenge posted by the Ocean Spill Recovery Institute to solve a thorny problem that has long hampered cleanup efforts from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, among others: the difficulty of separating frozen oil from water in collection barges. A chemist from the concrete industry proposed an approach based on a technique that has been used for years to move liquid concrete; he won $20,000, and the oil industry solved a decades-old problem within two months after posting it on the Web.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonprofits are beginning to use InnoCentive with success to help solve problems of poverty and disease in the developing world, as well. A Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored challenge produced a design for a compact milling machine that would allow rural farmers in India to increase their income to as much as $30 a day. The solver is a self-described "ideator, gearhead, and entrepreneur" – probably not someone in Rockefeller’s network of usual suspects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.innocentive.com/"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5254020140349957362" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SOoHewxOpPI/AAAAAAAAABo/oJLTfPGFWDE/s320/innocentive.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://gw.innocentive.com/ar/disciplineSearch?challenge-order-by=desc&amp;amp;challenge-sort-by=challengeNumber&amp;amp;viewMode=abstract&amp;amp;challenge-search-text=fastercures&amp;amp;challenge-search-button.x=0&amp;amp;challenge-search-button.y=0&amp;amp;challenge-search-button=Search"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; is a good deal less concrete than these, but no less important or in need of innovative thinking. We’re eager to see what kinds of responses we get back after the November 15th deadline. We could have tapped likely academics or consultants to write us a paper on overcoming the challenges of biomarker research and qualification.

Arradaza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;, Communications Director, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To win the war on cancer, our nation’s decision-makers need to enact policies that support cutting-edge developments in cancer research and facilitate patient-centered approaches throughout the research continuum. This message permeated through discussions at Friday’s &lt;a href="http://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Info/Summary.aspx?i=b9454e57-b634-4962-bdee-d4b94e75b0d3"&gt;Clinical Research Conference&lt;/a&gt; convened to address pressing scientific and regulatory challenges and opportunities for progress in innovations in cancer therapy. The conference was organized by &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/health.aspx"&gt;Brookings Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.focr.org/"&gt;Friends of Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.asco.org"&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.aacr.org/"&gt;American Association of Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a hundred leaders in cancer research and advocacy representing academia, government, industry, and the nonprofit sectors convened for a full day discussion of scientific and policy issues impacting clinical cancer research. The diversity of viewpoints and the depth of commitment to furthering cancer research spurred an engaged discussion among participants anxious to address our nation’s cancer challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NCI Director John Niederhuber said in his opening remarks, that the 21st century paradigm will be anchored on translational science and based on multiple, highly-targeted agents matched to molecularly selected patients. Important issues were raised by panels that followed and some key recommendations rose to the top. Highlights include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first panel looked into data standards and evidence requirements and noted that “it’s easy to get data…the challenge is to ensure the data we have is any good.” To make sure new drugs are safe and effective with the optimal amount of information, the panel recommended the development of qualitative and quantitative standards for data collection to streamline the path to more efficient clinical trials. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measuring treatment efficacy is a complex and subjective process and the oncology community has long sought endpoints other than overall survival. Looking for a better way of measuring the effectiveness of new drugs and accelerating safe and effective cancer drug development, the second panel proposed three different scenarios that look into progression-free survival as an indicator of clinical benefit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The promise of personalized cancer therapy remains largely unfulfilled and there have been few successful efforts to develop therapies and their targets simultaneously. The third panel recommended the following:&lt;br /&gt;- External stakeholders should be engaged in the design of a pathway for the development of diagnostics for tumor markers.&lt;br /&gt;- Tumor-marker clearance and approval should be based on demonstrated clinical benefit.&lt;br /&gt;- An advisory committee similar to the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee should be developed for tumor marker clearance and approval in order to improve consistency and coordination with other oncology programs in the agency. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final panel painted a vision for the FDA’s future. FOCR’s Ellen Sigal noted that complex science is at the base of all the discussions and that the process for defining a clear path forward is always evolving, making it critical to garner the input of diverse stakeholders every step of the way. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At day’s end, having mined the combined braintrust of panelists and participants, former FDA Commissioner David Kessler articulated a key action step and perhaps a challenge for the next person to lead the FDA. Kessler said we “need an FDA Commissioner who will say: find drugs that work for cancer.” Someone who is willing to take risks, make mistakes but who has a clear idea of what they want and be able to articulate this amidst competing priorities. On this note, be on the lookout for &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;’ upcoming recommendations for the new administration regarding the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/09/find-drugs-that-work-for-cancer.html"&gt;READ AND COMMENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

I recall getting my first work email account and not having anyone to really email anything to, except my colleagues on the same floor. &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/"&gt;Greg Simon&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; has talked about how he had a cell phone in the early days and was embarrassed to be talking on the street with it so he’d take it into a pay phone booth to look more “normal.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cell phones, email, and the Internet have certainly transformed things in ways we couldn’t have imagined, but they’ve introduced problems we couldn’t have imagined. Technologies such as FAX machines have been leapfrogged over. Problems such as the overabundance of information, and the speed of information flow are here to stay it seems. In the case of health IT, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; sees it as a vital bridge to the future of more rapid information collection, characterization, and analysis which could speed our time to cures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are working on a white paper for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services about educating and building awareness among consumers about personalized healthcare. This is another area where we must resist “magical thinking” and get down to brass tacks. Too often, the discussion about personalized medicine has been at a 30,000 foot level. For this paper, we’ve talked to many patient advocacy and disease research groups and everyone holds their breath about the potential power that these technologies may hold for their disease areas. They all want more targeted therapies with fewer side effects, which is ultimately the promise of personalized medicine. But they also recognize its complexities. It needs to take into account the world of co-morbidities we all live in; even if baby boomers are out running marathons and eating their greens and blueberries, the reality is that many of us are living with many conditions and diseases, not just one. It will probably raise costs before it can lower them. It's unlikely many diseases will yield to the relatively easy HER2-Herceptin gene-to-drug relationship. Patients are likely to get much more information about their genetic makeup than they can act on in the near-term. So, with all these complexities, is it magical thinking to ponder how scientific advancements in genomics and proteomics may change things for the better? Is it magical thinking to imagine a health IT system that can propel these advancements forward even faster? Or can we make it real? You tell me.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Perhaps it’s Still the Cat’s Meow…</title><description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/MStevens/"&gt;Melissa Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, Program Director, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://pcr.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=about_detail"&gt;The Bradley Center for Philanthropy and Civic Renewal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://philanthropy.com/"&gt;Chronicle of Philanthropy&lt;/a&gt; hosted a discussion, “Is Philanthropy Going to the Dogs?,” to debate the issues of donor intent, social justices, and public interest within the context of Leona Helmsley’s $8 billion bequest made in August 2007. The session, moderated by The Chronicle’s Stacy Palmer, brought together Professor Ray Madoff, Professor Leslie Lenkowsky, Pablo Eisenberg, and Judge Robert Burk from the &lt;a href="http://www.hudson.org/"&gt;Hudson Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Among the discussion’s highlights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professor Ray Madoff from Boston College argued this bequest is actually subsidized by the taxpayers because it is stipulated to be held in perpetuity and thus avoids the payment of $3.6 billion in estate taxes to the government. So, essentially this averting of taxes is equal to the government making a matching charitable gift to causes supported by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professor Leslie Lenkowsky from Indiana University countered that the philanthropists like Ms, Helmsley leverage their charitable gifts to express their values and their beliefs in what is important for the public good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pablo Eisenberg from Georgetown University projected that with the mass transfer of wealth ($41 trillion dollars between 2002 and 2052) we will see the rise of mega-foundations with assets of $50-$60 billion that will operate under the direction of only a few family members. He argued that limited input into the guidance of vast volumes of resources is contrary to democracy and perhaps the installation of antitrust laws similar to those enacted in the early 1900’s to protect consumers from big business would help to protect our society from philanthropic monopolies. This concentration of resource oversight would most likely also create a funding stream for the organizations (specifically higher education, healthcare, and cultural) that are of interest to the leadership. Many of these recipient organizations are selected because they have large names and thus are presumed to be “accountable” whereas lesser-known start-up nonprofits are assumed to be less fiscally responsible. Therefore, the aggregation of philanthropic dollars under a few mega-foundations would allow the “rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a provocative discussion begs you to ask whether philanthropy is indeed going to the dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Amidst all the talk, what struck me most is the apparent need for increased transparency in the philanthropy marketplace to better inform giving and more effectively channel funds to where they are most needed and can make most impact. The &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/programs/pas/"&gt;Philanthropy Advisory Service&lt;/a&gt; intends to do this for biomedical research nonprofits such that large organizations like &lt;a href="http://www.alz.org/index.asp"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt; and smaller organizations like &lt;a href="http://www.curealzfund.org/"&gt;Cure Alzheimer’s Fund&lt;/a&gt; are evaluated equally on their approach and execution in accelerating research in the Alzheimer’s disease area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eisenberg closed the session noting that despite the potential threats to philanthropy, we should remember that foundations should remain in a “special place” in our economy because they fund innovation, new ideas, and high-risk opportunities that others are unwilling to do. &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has echoed this unique ability and responsibility of nonprofit disease research to tackle the high-risk yet high-reward translational research that the government and industry are not inclined to fund. Although philanthropic dollars only account for about 2% of the R&amp;amp;D investment in the life sciences, it is an invaluable piece of the funding pie. We hope our efforts to inform charitable investment, build collaborations, and promote knowledge-sharing across sectors keep philanthropy from going to the dogs for its true value is the cat’s meow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Furthermore, &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/span&gt; are widely viewed as a critical technology to personalizing treatment choices and maximizing the impact of medical treatments. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12"&gt;Biomarkers&lt;/span&gt; are also a pivotal part of biomedical research process and can shave years and millions of dollars from the research and development process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to identify and implement global solutions to accelerate the process of discovery and clinical development of new therapies for the treatment of deadly and debilitating diseases. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Challenge will be posted in &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14"&gt;InnoCentive&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://gw.innocentive.com/ar/challengePavilion/index?pavilionName=Global+Health"&gt;Global Health Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, a section of the website that focuses on Challenges that contribute to solving some of the world’s biggest Health challenges. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In support of its mission to change the world and influence the lives of people everywhere, &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15"&gt;InnoCentive&lt;/span&gt; is providing shared funding for this Challenge as its initial philanthropic initiative in open innovation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The partnership will allow &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to reach &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17"&gt;InnoCentive&lt;/span&gt;’s network of more than 160,000 Solvers based in 175 countries worldwide. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is one of many partnerships &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18"&gt;InnoCentive&lt;/span&gt; has had with nonprofit organizations to encourage solutions to world problems.

Reducing the ‘first-mover disadvantage’ in &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_24"&gt;biomarker&lt;/span&gt; research and validation can significantly accelerate the search for cures and improved treatments for deadly and debilitating diseases.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_25"&gt;Venable&lt;/span&gt;, Executive Vice President, &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_26"&gt;InnoCentive&lt;/span&gt;, Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to announce this partnership as our first philanthropic challenge where &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_27"&gt;InnoCentive&lt;/span&gt; is providing award funding as part of our mission to invest in causes that our employees and shareholders are passionate about.

With several competing priorities vying for their attention, it seems hard to imagine that there will be much airplay for the importance of and challenges for medical research.  Why is this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason might be America’s low level of scientific literacy.  A 2007 Harris Interactive survey of 1,304 adults found that only 26 percent believe that they themselves have a good understanding of science, and 44 percent couldn’t name a single scientist, living or dead, that they’d consider a role model for our young people.   But this does not mean Americans do not care about science.  In fact, another Harris poll found that 85 percent of Americans want a presidential debate on science. Maybe Americans are leaving the medical research discussions to “those” people who are in the know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason could be that medical research doesn’t rise up your priority list until your health is personally affected.  We know that we’ll all be patients, some day, but if you are not yet a patient, why worry, right?  People also probably don’t realize the continuum of how we get from basic research to clinical research to therapies.  But as the baby boomers age, the issue of how close we are to cures continues to take on new and more important meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what the reason, the fact remains that Americans need to hear more than just the specifics of the health care reform platforms that focus mainly on economic issues.  They need to hear about a care– to–cure platform, and our nation’s leaders need to answer the question Michael J. Fox posed, “Who is in charge of finding cures?”  The list of challenges is long: flat funding for &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, concerns about retaining the next generation of researchers, questions about the appropriate balance between basic and translational research at the, low levels of funding for &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, inability to get the Reagan-Udall Foundation off the ground because of political games, need for research to be included in discussions of electronic health records...the list goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are part of ongoing discussions with many organizations about these issues and have several initiatives to address these problems. We are one of the partners supporting &lt;a href="http://www.researchamerica.org/"&gt;Research!America's&lt;/a&gt; voter education initiative &lt;a href="http://www.yourcandidatesyourhealth.org/"&gt;Your Candidates.

Before summer's end, we wanted to share some of our insights on the ten things we've been watching (other than the Olympics) and how they are faring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Return on philanthropy. This fall, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures &lt;/em&gt;will preview its &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/programs/pas/"&gt;Philanthropy Advisory Service&lt;/a&gt;, which will help philanthropists decide where their contributions will have the greatest Return on Philanthropy – the greatest impact in finding new cures. The &lt;a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/default.htm"&gt;Gates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rwjf.org/"&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundations&lt;/a&gt; are supporting this effort to create an information marketplace to improve the efficiency and productivity of both the philanthropic investor and the nonprofit disease research organizations that depend on such support. Watch this space for updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The FDA. It hasn’t been a great year for FDA. In the first half of 2008 alone, the agency had to deal with contaminated heparin from China, salmonella-tainted jalapenos from Mexico, and a Supreme Court decision that has made it a shield protecting medical device manufacturers from lawsuits by patients. The silver lining is that all this bad news is focusing attention on the agency’s critical importance and woeful lack of resources. FDA chief Andy von Eschenbach even broke ranks with the Administration and confessed that the agency needs a larger budget than requested to do its job. But it needs more than that, starting with Congressional leadership that supports it constructively rather than attacking and denigrating it. A key step would be to fund the Reagan-Udall Foundation, and realize &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/criticalpath/initiative.html"&gt;FDA’s Critical Path initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Research: Lost in translation. The call for more translational research is now coming from a wider range of stakeholders, including interesting messengers such as Katie Couric. In a recent interview about the September 5, 2008 &lt;a href="http://www.standup2cancer.org/"&gt;Stand Up To Cancer&lt;/a&gt; fundraising effort on “&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/larry.king.live/"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;,” Couric said that its focus will be supporting research that has practical applications and patient-relevant outcomes. She noted that the funding will be"...focusing on cutting edge cancer research, which will hopefully inform people about how close we are to new therapies and new approaches and how…scientists need additional funding so these can go from the lab to the clinic and hopefully, eventually, save a lot of lives.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Science 2.0. On June 3rd, members of &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/programs/train/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;’ TRAIN network&lt;/a&gt; of disease research foundations spent some time with two innovators in the use of online platforms for scientific collaboration. June Kinoshita, Executive Editor of &lt;a href="http://www.alzforum.org/"&gt;Alzheimer Research Forum&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneering e-community for Alzheimer’s researchers, is currently working on an ambitious project called Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine (SWAN), which will create a common semantic framework to allow researchers to more quickly and seamlessly integrate and combine data from diverse sources rather than just exchange documents. Jeff Shrager, Chief Technology Officer of &lt;a href="http://collabrx.com/"&gt;CollabRx&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrated its product – a “virtual biotech,” a Web-based collaborative research platform that would enable funding organizations and research teams to manage, track, and prioritize their operations as well as to share data, knowledge, resources, and services. CollabRx is also working with &lt;a href="http://sciencecommons.org/"&gt;Science Commons&lt;/a&gt; on its Health Commons initiative, which envisions a virtual marketplace or ecosystem where participants share data, knowledge, materials and services to accelerate research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Crowd-sourcing innovation. &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is seeking to benefit from the “wisdom of the crowd” by posting an “ideation challenge” on &lt;a href="http://www.innocentive.com/"&gt;InnoCentive’s&lt;/a&gt; Web site this fall, as one of the company’s first “Public Policy and Citizens in Action” challenges seeking solutions to important issues facing society. The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported in July how this approach is “catching on…as would-be innovators can sign up online to compete for prizes for feats as diverse as landing on the Moon and inventing artificial meat....” Keep an eye out for more details – maybe you’ll have some ideas to offer and potentially win the prize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Prize philanthropy. Top-down prizes are getting a lot of attention this year, not only by the press but by politicians. A panel appointed by the &lt;a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.htm"&gt;National Research Council&lt;/a&gt; recommended that the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; offer prizes of $200,000 to $2 million in various areas of science to encourage innovation. Two weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/home/us"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; challenged political and business leaders to outline how they’d spend $10 billion in four years to address global problems. Newt Gingrich proposed the development and diffusion of new technologies by using large, tax-free prizes, arguing that prizes would be a useful experiment in large-scale breakthroughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Biomarkers Consortium. &lt;a href="http://www.biomarkersconsortium.org/"&gt;The Biomarkers Consortium&lt;/a&gt; public-private partnership has taken the interesting step of identifying “High Impact Biomarkers Opportunities.” Rather than be, essentially, investigator-driven and wait for participants (industry, academia, foundations) to walk in the door with good ideas, the Foundation for the NIH has chosen to develop this more strategic and prescriptive path, laying out projects that it believes “will have the greatest and most proximal impact on future diagnosis and treatment of patients and drug development.” We will continue to watch with interest to see if this effort proves to be an effective way of addressing the “first-mover disadvantage” in biomarker research and validation – i.e., the first mover spends all money and its competitors get the advantage of the biomarker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Comparative effectiveness. The healthcare reform drumbeat is getting louder -- and much of the call for change is focused on the need for more cost effective and efficient approaches to our nation’s healthcare woes. Despite the buzz around comparative effectiveness, it’s important to note that both presidential nominees recognize that this issue is more complex than it may appear. In response to a question on the issue posed by the “&lt;a href="http://www.yourcandidatesyourhealth.org/"&gt;Your Candidates - Your Health&lt;/a&gt;” program (of which &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; is a sponsor), Sen. McCain said we need “to ensure that [this] does not stifle the spirit of innovation,” and Sen. Obama cautions that the “decision on which treatment to use should be made by patients and doctors, not government or insurance companies.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Electronic health records (EHRs). As the federal government muddles through its continuing effort to figure out what its role in the development of the “healthcare information superhighway” should be, there are at least small signs that it might be waking up to the importance of factoring research uses of EHRs into their plans. &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently joined a panel of research leaders that called on the group charged with creating the successor to the &lt;a href="http://www.altarum.org/index.cfm?setFlash=yes"&gt;American Health Information Community&lt;/a&gt; to expand its scope and mesh data standards for medical research with its work on standards for e-health records. The group said it would consider how best to do that. Meanwhile, the FDA has launched its &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/advance/sentinel/"&gt;Sentinel initiative&lt;/a&gt; to better monitor medical product safety, a massive effort that will involve using existing electronic health records for post-marketing surveillance of approved drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Clinical trials: Something’s gotta give. The discovery enterprise is calling for revolutionary change in how we conduct clinical trials. The NIH is studying how to accelerate and improve the &lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/07/nih-asks-how-to-create-more-effective.html"&gt;conduct of clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; at its own Clinical Center, which could provide useful information and models to other trial sponsors. The &lt;a href="http://rwjfblogs.typepad.com/pioneer/2007/10/building-arches.html"&gt;Pioneer Portfolio of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (which supports &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;’ Philanthropy Advisory Service project) has made its largest grant to build ARCHeS, a Web-based interface and delivery system that will allow far more health and policy decision-makers to use the Archimedes simulation model – a sophisticated database that some believe could be used to radically streamline the design and simulation of clinical trials. This is definitely an area worthy of focused attention by the next President.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Seven years ago this week, I was focused on a very different journey -- my father’s passage from this life at the age of 91 after a short struggle with small cell lung cancer. He died on August 27, 2001, a date notable because it spared him in his last days the trauma of seeing the calling card of 21st Century terrorism on September 11 that year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thought often of my father’s death in the context of my work at &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;. He was a model of “compressed morbidity” – living long and dying quickly, rather than fading out over many years. He changed his behavior after a small heart attack in his fifties, brought on no doubt by smoking which he promptly quit. He walked home from his grocery store on Main Street every day for lunch and a nap. He ate healthy food, didn’t drink, and – in addition to the walking commute to the store – exercised by shadow boxing in front of the bathroom mirror every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his personal good habits, he became a victim of the healthcare system of small town America. When he complained about “tingling” in his legs, his doctor gave him Valium to which he promptly became addicted to the point of needing sleeping pills at night since he was medicated all day. When my sister and I discovered this we intervened to switch him to Motrin gradually until finally he didn’t need the Valium. A few months later on another doctor’s visit, the same doctor put him back on Valium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few times in his later years he was admitted to the hospital for minor operations, he was given Demerol which causes you to go psychotic if you are on Valium. But, of course, in those days of paper records (these days too, I should point out), the hospital didn’t know or negligently failed to notice or care that he was on Valium. They found out when orderlies had to chase him down the hall, trailing his feeding tubes, to get him back to bed. I once had to block him from trying to walk through a wall in his hospital room to what he thought was his dining room at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His cancer diagnosis brought a completely different set of challenges. First, it was amazing he was diagnosed at all. There were no oncologists in Blytheville, Arkansas then. Two doctors came over from Memphis twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. As I testified at &lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/05/war-on-cancer-37-years-later.html"&gt;Sen. Kennedy’s hearing&lt;/a&gt; on cancer several months ago (before his own diagnosis), in Blytheville, you could only get cancer on Tuesday or Thursday. But with the diagnosis came the Scylla and Charybdis – chemo or radiation, since that was what the two doctors offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How was a patient 91 years old living in a small town supposed to make that decision? Fortunately my father knew people who knew people – that would be me. I called Al Rabson at the National Cancer Institute who was well-known in Washington for offering helpful advice on such matters. He reviewed my father’s records and X-Rays, reviewed the two doctors and their training and gave me the news. My father would die from this cancer but he did not need to be in pain, so skip the chemo, focus on radiation to keep the lungs clear enough to avoid pneumonia and enjoy the last months as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, giving effective pain medications to someone who has been addicted to Valium for years is not easy. We went through “pain patches,” Oxycontin and finally morphine. After six months, my father slipped into a coma which gave him release from the pain. After a few days, the hospice nurse – a most miraculous find in my small home town – told us “Your father is going to die in the next thirty minutes.” And as my mother and sister and I sat there, we experienced that ineffable but palpable difference when the quick becomes the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have often thought how different his death would have been if he and my mother had been on their own. How confused they would have been in dealing with the cancer; how painful the end could have become. I have thought too how strong he must have been to survive the bad medical care he received all his life in the Arkansas Delta and to still live to be 91.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simply not acceptable or tolerable that we still are killing people with medication errors in hospitals (both by giving them the wrong drug or by giving the “right” drug to the wrong person). It is inexcusable that the best cancer care is still available primarily only to people who know people – no matter how many people those people, including me, try to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father didn’t live to see me launch &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; with Mike Milken five years ago. But his life and the circumstances of his leaving it launched me on this path and live with me every day. Through our work I hope we can improve the lives of people who don’t know people, of people who live in places where you can get cancer only on Tuesdays, and of people whose desires to live a full life and avoid a long, painful decline into death depends on the kindness of strangers.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

None of these people are&lt;br /&gt;responsible for finding a cure for your disease…and none of them are necessarily&lt;br /&gt;connected to the people working to find a cure for your disease… How do we&lt;br /&gt;integrate the care community with the cure community?" -- Greg Simon,&lt;br /&gt;FasterCures President, in remarks to the American Health Information Community, 7/29/2008 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg joined an expert panel of medical research leaders and advocates recently to call on the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/documents/m20080729/01_agenda.html"&gt;American Health Information Community&lt;/a&gt; (AHIC) to ensure that the nationwide health information system being built can improve patient care and enable medical research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ongoing discussion surrounding the creation of a national health information technology (IT) system, medical research lurks in the shadows of privacy and interoperability. At the AHIC meeting at the end of July, the medical research community made a resounding call for AHIC or its successor organization to put in place a supplemental process to ensure that the nation’s health IT system is built to improve both healthcare delivery and medical research – and to do so quickly. &lt;a href="http://www.govhealthit.com/online/news/350492-1.html"&gt;See coverage of the AHIC meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensuring utmost privacy protections and efficient interoperability capabilities are critical to the success and sustainability of a health IT system. As we build the system’s infrastructure, it is just as critical to consider how best to utilize patient data to improve healthcare delivery, enable medical research, and accelerate cures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be new opportunities for health information exchange to support clinical research activities as electronic health record (EHR) adoption increases and a national standardized system evolves. Incorporating medical research into a national health IT system is inevitable. As AHIC transitions into its next entity, it has an important choice to make: to implement a health IT system that protects privacy and ensures operability now, only to rebuild that system to better support medical research OR; to implement a comprehensive, interoperable health IT system with the highest privacy standards and a strong research capacity already in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; believes accelerating cures must be a goal of the emerging Nationwide Health Information Network in addition to improving patient care. While the focus of most efforts to do so has been on improving care by limiting costs and medical errors, the real savings, in terms of both reducing healthcare costs and, more importantly, in eliminating human suffering, will come from curing disease and from limiting its damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related Blogs: &lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/06/health-its-real-savings.html"&gt;Health IT's Real Savings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information on &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; recommendations for using &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/programs/trehr/"&gt;EHRs to bridge patient care and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Moderated by Dr. Harold Varmus, the meeting featured presentations from seven eminent Alzheimer’s researchers, highlighting the importance of an antecedent biomarker and providing an update of ongoing efforts, using media such as imaging, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the importance of biomarkers is well known, the importance of reliable and low-cost antecedent biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is paramount and should be appreciated in the context of the disease. First, AD is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease—once clinical symptoms appear, the neurons that govern the affected functions are permanently lost. This means that even if we had a cure that addresses the cause of the disease, it will not necessarily revive the lost functions for later-stage patients—unless we also find a way of regenerating lost neurons. Early treatment through early detection is not only ideal but critical in reducing the burden of the disease—preventing the clinical form of the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to its limitation in detecting clinical symptoms, the current AD diagnostics are not always accurate nor available. AD diagnosis based on clinical symptoms has an accuracy of over 90 percent when conducted by experienced clinicians. Unfortunately, this is often not the case for mild AD, when distinction with mild cognitive impairment (which does not progress to dementia) may not be as obvious. And, "experienced clinicians" are a scarce resource. Instead, primary care physicians, thrust on the frontlines of AD care, may not necessarily have the tools and training to recognize AD. With these factors, it is more important than ever to develop a reliable and widely-available diagnostic tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We discussed &lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/06/alzheimers-disease-diagnosis-could-be.html"&gt;Dr. Lee Goldstein’s effort&lt;/a&gt; to develop an eye exam to diagnose AD a few weeks ago. And last week, I was pleased to see that scientists are pushing forward multiple other efforts. Identification of multiple markers will allow us to choose a marker that best fits the purpose—whether it is for diagnosis, management of risk factors, or measurement treatment effectiveness. Such efforts exactly match &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;’ goal—to accelerate the process of discovery and clinical development of new therapies. We look forward to see many more such efforts, not only in AD but also in other diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;*The proceedings from the Town Hall will be made available at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.AlzStudyGroup.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;www.AlzStudyGroup.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/07/ad-challenge-hitting-right-mark.html"&gt;Read and Comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The study ranks 30 different metropolitan areas based on the financial performance of nonprofit organizations in each area. Based on the aggregate performance of nonprofits for each metropolitan area, the areas are ranked according to CEO compensation, level of financial reserves, volume of funds raised, and other Charity Navigator financial metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nonprofit experts and concerned individuals have highlighted, in various venues, the limitations of Charity Navigator’s focus on financial performance in evaluating nonprofit organizations. Financial metrics based on data from tax forms have the advantage of being available for most organizations, but they provide limited insight into an organization’s actual impact or potential. For this reason, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/programs/pas/"&gt;Philanthropy Advisory Service&lt;/a&gt; (PAS) program focuses on the qualitative aspects of nonprofit disease research organizations, including their strategies, management policies, governance structures, and results-to-date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned that the Metro Market Study’s focus on financial metrics may provide an unbalanced view of the performance of nonprofit organizations and wonder about the consequences of prioritizing geographic location above all other considerations. What insight does this singular focus on location convey?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nonprofit organizations, especially those serving local communities, operate on a local level, and for those organizations, location does affect both their missions and financial performance. However, there are also a sizeable number of organizations whose missions are to serve on a national or even global level. Therefore, the importance of location is different across the types and missions of the organizations—which does not seem to be taken into account in the Metro Market Study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fundamentally, I question the value of using location as the first criteria to analyze the financial performance or concluding that charities operate according to the general practices of their metropolitan areas. For example, the focus of &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/programs/pas/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;’ PAS&lt;/a&gt; program is on nonprofit organizations engaged in medical research and none of the organizations to be studied aim to develop a treatment only for the residents of the community where they are located, rather they aim to find cures for all. This is true not just for the mission of the organizations, but also for its financial aspects. For example, all of the five organizations ranked as raising the most funds through special events, as reported by Charity &lt;a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=studies.events"&gt;Navigator’s Special Event Study&lt;/a&gt;, conduct their fundraising events across the country, rather than just in the community where they are headquartered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern I’d like to raise is the ultimate value of the information produced through this study. Should a nonprofit organization based in Detroit, the metropolitan area with the lowest overall score (Charity Navigator’s measure for overall financial health), move to Miami, which has the highest overall score, and would its financial situation improve (or can it even move given its mission)? Probably not. The same goes for donors. Should the donors make their giving decision based on the location of the headquarters or take the location as a sign of financial health? And how will this help donors interested in giving to nonprofit organizations based in their own community?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A comprehensive analysis of other factors, such as the organization’s area of focus, strategy, process, and governance structure, are probably needed and more important than headquarter location in guiding giving decisions and determining the drivers of financial health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charity Navigator is one of the largest databases on nonprofit organizations with a wide scope of coverage. These advantages can be used to understand the key drivers of growth and performance in nonprofit organizations and conduct meta-analyses to understand larger trends. Its analysis of the nonprofit marketplace should focus on variables that really matter—I felt the Metro Market Study fell short of living up to its potential.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The Clinical Center is really a national jewel, the largest hospital in the world dedicated exclusively to research (and therefore a major sponsor of clinical trials).  It has almost 2000 active protocols in which tens of thousands of patients participate with the goal of advancing our understanding of disease and, one hopes, developing more effective treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even though the Clinical Center has spectacular resources compared to many clinical trials sites around the country -- starting with its beautiful new building and state-of-the-art lab space in Bethesda -- it experiences all the same frustrations with the process as everyone else.  Regulatory burdens increasing.  Inconsistent policies and practices among Institutional Review Boards -- even within NIH there is no uniformity, and different Institutes and Centers handle things differently!  Flat research funding.  Declining numbers of clinical researchers.  It hopes through its study of the problems on its own campus to inform the debate outside its walls, in the extramural research community.  The goal of the NIH's review is to share best practices in conducting trials across the institutes and centers within NIH, and to identify over-interpretation of applicable regulations.  Officials who spoke at the event seemed confident that many of the barriers were not externally imposed but were rather due to differing interpretations of regulations and the sheer volume of changing requirements, with which everyone finds it hard to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NIH's Intramural Research Program -- the research conducted on its campus by NIH-employed scientists -- of which the Clinical Center is a part, is a little recognized critical resource in our taxpayer-funded research portfolio.  At its best it provides a model of cutting-edge biomedical research for the extramural, mostly academic research world, taking on the highest-impact science and suggesting solutions to systemic challenges.  We hope that this effort to plow through the thicket of complaints and paperwork that surround clinical research and clinical trials will be such a model for the rest of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/KSchneeman/"&gt;Kristin Schneeman&lt;/a&gt;, Program Director, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/KSchneeman/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Fox Foundation (&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;MJFF&lt;/span&gt;) CEO in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katie-hood/breaking-out-of-the-acade_b_109369.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; discusses getting higher returns on medical research philanthropy, and asserts that “private philanthropists need to break out of the collective comfort zone of a traditional, 'academics-only' approach.” Her organization and several others were profiled at the recent Biotechnology Industry Organization convention in two panels and via the partnering database. Although the models pioneered by groups such as &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;MJFF&lt;/span&gt;, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;CFF&lt;/span&gt;) and Multiple &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;Myeloma&lt;/span&gt; Research Foundation continue to garner attention and are looked to as best practices, Ms. Hood also raises the important question of why there are not more examples being proliferated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our recently released report, &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/resources/publications/papers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurs for Cures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, focuses on the need for and importance of more examples that will lead to medical breakthroughs, and notes that, “The measure of our success is lives saved and suffering diminished – not the number of grants awarded, publications presented, or laboratory space acquired.” This report highlights how nonprofit disease research organizations are finding and funding big ideas, effectively paving the way for developing new business models to accelerate research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an all-day session at the Institute of Medicine (&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;IOM&lt;/span&gt;) on June 23, 2008, I spent the day hearing speakers on the topic of “&lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3740/24155/52801.aspx"&gt;Breakthrough Business Models: Drug Development for Rare and Neglected Diseases and Individualized Therapies&lt;/a&gt;,” which spotlighted nonprofits as innovators in translating research from basic science to therapies for patients. A wide variety of topics were raised: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;for academic researchers: How can we get beyond the need to only share results via peer-reviewed journals? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for diseases of the developing world: how can we raise the incentives to address them? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;IOM&lt;/span&gt; meeting, I moderated a panel on “&lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/?id=54295"&gt;Strategies for Facilitating Sharing of Research Materials and Data&lt;/a&gt;” where Michael &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;Mowatt&lt;/span&gt;, Director of the Office of Technology Development of NIH’s &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;NIAID&lt;/span&gt;, talked about the imperative to share via repositories and other means. He highlighted the example of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gate’s Foundations AIDS vaccine collaborations as an example to look to. Sharon Terry, President &amp;amp; CEO of the Genetic Alliance urged the audience to “Learn the rules so you can break them properly” and recounted the experience at the Alliance in “herding cats” to get research not just from bench to bedside but to get it into practice. She reflected that one way they herded cats was by moving the food. That would certainly get my cat’s attention. The Genetic Alliance repository was described as an “&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;ebay&lt;/span&gt;” for samples. Laurie Ryan, Program Director of Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials at the National Institute on Aging, NIH, discussed the Alzheimer’s Disease &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9"&gt;Neuroimaging&lt;/span&gt; Initiative, an important public-private partnership which is gaining increased international attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a panel on intellectual property, Craig &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10"&gt;Sorensen&lt;/span&gt;, Senior Director of Strategic Research Alliances at Vertex Pharmaceuticals outlined their work and collaborations in cystic fibrosis with &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11"&gt;CFF&lt;/span&gt;, Huntington’s disease with the Cure Huntington’s Disease Initiative, and tuberculosis and said that “industry is hiding behind cliches about failure and is doing a lot of running and staying in place.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12"&gt;Queta&lt;/span&gt; Bond, President of the Burroughs &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13"&gt;Wellcome&lt;/span&gt; Fund said at the end of the day, “We need to let more flowers bloom.” At &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we’ll keep figuring out if we can help the process along and provide as much fertilizer as we can…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/MAnderson/"&gt;Margaret Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, COO, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://fastercures.blogspot.com/2008/06/nonprofits-find-and-fund-big-ideas-in.html"&gt;Read and Comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

After an overview of the Pfizer oncology portfolio, Dr. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;Kavita&lt;/span&gt; Patel, Deputy Staff Director of the Senate Health, Education, Labor &amp;amp; Pensions committee, spoke about her work on Senator Kennedy’s much anticipated cancer legislation.  The legislation will look at the highest priorities for federal action and will take a much needed comprehensive approach so as not to pit one cancer against another.  She highlighted many of the unfortunate realities in cancer research that continue to need attention: a &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;biospecimen&lt;/span&gt; network that is not entirely networked and not universally accessible to researchers, a clinical trials system that mystifies even the most &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;savvy&lt;/span&gt; patients and &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;practitioners&lt;/span&gt;, and a need to do more…much more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She cited the need to look closely at public/private partnerships and to fortify what the public and private sectors can do together to advance cancer research and care.  When I asked her if the legislation was going to &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;incent&lt;/span&gt; opportunities to fund and target innovative research at the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; she replied that they’d looked closely at existing models that allow this flexibility.  Will this cost money?  You bet.  But Dr. Patel pointed out that if we don’t put money into this now, we’ll lose tremendous opportunities for innovation, not to mention the prospect of losing talent to other nations that are not intimidated by risk and are recruiting scientific talent faster than the American Idol winners are getting scooped up.  Finally, she said they want to do health care policy forecasting so they can &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;-anticipate what the implications of the legislation will be on all the systems in six months, one year, five years, etc.  How refreshing to think about some advance planning in biomedical research!  It is inspiring to hear her talk about Senator Kennedy’s renewed commitment to this legislation, and comforting to know that the Lion of the Senate is roaring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;Ellerbee&lt;/span&gt;, a noted journalist and breast cancer survivor gave a captivating luncheon speech about the power of each patient and described her personal journey after her diagnosis 16 years ago.  It was remarkable to think back to a time when speaking of breast cancer or any cancer for that matter was a taboo subject.  I have worked in the HIV/AIDS movement and have seen the same transformation in that arena, where HIV invoked fear and silence.  Ms. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;Ellerbee&lt;/span&gt; talked about how when the public demands something, things can change.  I reflected on how AIDS and cancer activists have changed the landscape of biomedical policy.  We still need much more change, so her words were an important reminder that there is always more to do.  At &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.fastercures.org"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we are embarking on several exciting new initiatives in our new strategic plan. Stay tuned to hear about ways we want to impact many of these issues and foster change, in areas such as &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9"&gt;biobanking&lt;/span&gt;, the conduct of clinical trials, and in fostering innovation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/MAnderson/"&gt;Margaret Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, COO, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bio2008.bdmetrics.com/SDT-20709100/Improve-Your-Risk-Reward-Ratio-by-Partnering-with-Nonprofits/Details.aspx"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt; of nonprofit leaders and biotechnology executives at this year’s BIO convention, organized by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and moderated by &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/MAnderson/"&gt;Margaret Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt; Chief Operating Officer, unanimously concurred that new paradigms are needed and that therapeutic outcomes are not likely to come out of academic research centers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;At &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.fastercures.org"&gt;FasterCures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we believe that one of the most significant impediments to accelerating progress toward cures is the difficulty of transforming research with therapeutic promise into marketable, profitable products that help patients. To address this major roadblock, there are growing numbers of biotech companies beginning to forge new and innovative alliances with nonprofit research foundations to reach new product development milestones. And many of the nonprofit research foundations understand that the only way their work will ultimately help the patients they serve is if they can "hand off the baton" at some point to an entity that makes products and can get them to patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Free of the imperatives of publication and career advancement in academia and the bottom-line imperatives of the private sector, disease research foundations are ideally positioned to make relatively high-risk investments that could significantly move a field of disease research forward and increase the likelihood that other parties will also invest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Panel highlights:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Katie Hood, CEO at the &lt;a href="http://www.michaeljfox.org/"&gt;Michael J. Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (MJFF), talked about how they are proactive about project management with their grantees and believe in collaboration. Their work with Elan shows a recognition of the leadership that MJFF has provided in the Parkinson’s research arena.

Additionally, Boger said this partnership energized employees, stimulating renewed commitment to finding a cure for cystic fibrosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Another example of a successful partnership is between the &lt;a href="http://www.multiplemyeloma.org/"&gt;Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (MMRF) and &lt;a href="http://www.proteolix.com/"&gt;Proteolix, Inc&lt;/a&gt;. Louise Perkins, Director of Research at the MMRF, talked about the many initiatives MMRF is engaged in to aggressively find a cure for multiple myeloma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Lori Kunkle, Chief Medical Officer at &lt;a href="http://www.proteolix.com/"&gt;Proteolix&lt;/a&gt;, discussed how this partnership yielded greater enrollment in clinical trials, allowing them to accelerate their schedule, broadened exposure to multiple uses of a particular drug and allowed Proteolix to make early decisions about whether to move a compound forward in he development process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;For-profit biotechnology companies look to nonprofit disease research organizations for strategic and intellectual guidance as well, allowing access to a broad and deep arsenal of disease-specific research, patient networks, and advocacy tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Panelists acknowledge that the bottom-line drivers differ for each partner. On the for-profit side, profit drives the quest for innovation, while for nonprofit foundations the ultimate goal is finding a cure for the disease. The need to accurately understand the drivers and pay-offs for each partner is vital in ensuring a successful relationship; a model that’s beginning to change the paradigm of our medical research enterprise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Many analysts believe that a "paradigm shift" is occurring at many pharmaceutical companies, which are realizing that relying on the blockbuster drug model for profits is no longer a viable business model and that – particularly as personalized medicine becomes a reality – there is a &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/resources/publications/papers/"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5216611692306637538" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SGUgsgMWIuI/AAAAAAAAAAo/C2h08e-LXJY/s200/FastercuresWP_052808_thumbnail.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;role for therapies for niche markets in their pipelines. These new business models require new partners, and hopefully the BIO meeting continued to nurture some of those existing relationships and the ones that are beginning to grow. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;More discussion of these issues can also be found in our newly released report, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/resources/publications/papers/"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000099;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurs for Cures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;, available to download now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/CArradaza/"&gt;Cecilia O.

Early diagnosis in combination with early intervention will yield far more effective treatment options and disease management strategies. In addition, biomarkers can facilitate disease monitoring to more efficiently determine patient’s response to current treatment regimens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.biomarkersconsortium.org/"&gt;Biomarkers Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, a collaborative public-private partnership managed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, biomarkers are objective measurements of biological processes that can substantially improve the precision with which we evaluate disease risk, diagnosis, and progression, and guide treatment. They also promise to revolutionize both the development and use of therapeutics. In some cases, they may allow for earlier “go/no go” decisions in developing treatments and help shave years and cost off the development process by providing a clearer indication of a treatment’s efficacy, dosage, or safety. Biomarkers are the foundation of evidence-based medicine, making the practice of medicine more personalized, predictive, and preemptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advancement of biomarker science is particularly important for patients suffering from AD for which the current diagnosis takes approximately two years and consists of a complex “process of elimination” based upon cognitive symptoms. A biomarker for AD would impact this field of medicine dramatically, allowing for earlier treatment and more accurate monitoring -- greatly needed to fight an impending AD epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AD is characterized by large amounts of plaques of beta-amyloid in the brain. Beta-amyloid is formed when amyloid precursor protein an important protein for neuron growth and repair is severed by enzymes. Four years ago, Lee Goldstein from Boston University, featured on the panel, and his research team found that these amyloid plaques also collect in the lens of eyes in people afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease and causes an unusual cataract that is different from common age-related cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease was identified. Goldstein’s discovery established the first evidence of Alzheimer’s-linked pathology outside the brain, and led Goldstein and his colleagues to develop a laser-based diagnostic technology that searches for amyloid protein buildup in the eyes and could aid in early detection of the disease. Goldstein’s team hopes that in the next couple of years physicians will be able to use this laser-based molecular diagnostic screening test for Alzheimer’s disease and do without the costly, two-year, multiple-visit Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine the potential biomarker technology could provide the way we efficiently and accurately diagnose diseases, improve quality of clinical care, and enhance disease management for patients and caregivers. At &lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we will continue to keep a close eye on developments in biomarker science and support efforts that encourage, inspire, and fuel innovation in medical research and discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/MStevens/"&gt;Melissa Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Special Projects, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

In our knowledge-based economy, states are committing major capital and human resources to remain competitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A report released last week at the &lt;a href="http://www.bio2008.org/"&gt;BIO 2008 Convention&lt;/a&gt; by the Milken Institute, the &lt;a href="http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&amp;amp;ID=38801155&amp;amp;cat=resrep"&gt;State Technology and Science Index 2008&lt;/a&gt;, takes a comprehensive look at each state’s ability to deal with the shifting nature of the economy and assesses science and technology assets that could be leveraged to promote economic development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Milken Institute study, the states are ranked based on 77 individual indicators in five categories: research and development; risk capital and entrepreneurial infrastructure; human capital investment; technology and science workforce: and technology concentration and dynamism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts tops the list and “continues to set the pace for &lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SGESmy5OFLI/AAAAAAAAAAY/GaePQY9cBnY/s1600-h/CIMG4306.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215470301177844914" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SGESmy5OFLI/AAAAAAAAAAY/GaePQY9cBnY/s200/CIMG4306.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;other states in terms of technology and science capabilities.” A hotbed of research, world-renowned research universities and cutting-edge firms fuel the state’s economy. On June 16, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick signed a bill that commits $1 billion into the state's growing life sciences industry over the next decade. The bill includes $250 million in tax incentives for companies, $250 million in grants, and $500 million for infrastructure, much of which is earmarked for the state university system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.masslifesciences.com/clips/clip_06_16_08globe.html"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;, “though biotech still only accounts for a little more than 1 percent of the state's workforce, Patrick has focused on nurturing the life sciences industry because of its growth potential, high salaries, and ability to pump money into the economy.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranking a close second is Maryland, which moved up from 4th place in the 2004 index. &lt;a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SGETAL_6aOI/AAAAAAAAAAg/AD9YB8ixFEQ/s1600-h/CIMG4295.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215470737413531874" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_alGK8PRJHaM/SGETAL_6aOI/AAAAAAAAAAg/AD9YB8ixFEQ/s200/CIMG4295.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The same day Massachusetts signed its $1 billion life sciences bill, Governor Martin O’Malley unveiled its BIO 2020 Initiative, an effort that will invest $1.1 billion in the state’s bioscience industry over the next 10 years to attract and grow biotechnology companies in Maryland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In announcing this new initiative, Gov. O’Malley said, “At the end of the day, our greatness as a State and as a people will be determined by how we meet the essential challenge of the present. How we invest in our capabilities for healing this fragile and ever smaller world of ours.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorado remains in third place. California places fourth, slipping from 2nd place in the 2004 index. Fifth place goes to Washington. For a complete list of state rankings, download a copy of the &lt;a href="http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&amp;amp;ID=38801155&amp;amp;cat=resrep"&gt;Milken Institute report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“States that have a vision and a plan for building and retaining high-wage jobs and viable industries are finding ways to invest in their science and technology assets,” said Ross DeVol, director of Regional Economics at the Milken Institute, and lead author of the study. “The changes in this year’s Index give a good measure of who is ahead in the increasing competition for scarce human capital and other resources needed for a successful industry.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report highlighted a new challenge that arose as an unintended consequence of post 9-11 security restrictions on student visas. International graduate student enrollment in U.S. universities has declined, limiting the opportunity to attract the world’s top talents into American institutions. The nation faces the possibility of losing human capital overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This forces states to compete to draw both human and financial capital from other states.&lt;br /&gt;And, with more states scoring near the mean, competition between states is expected to intensify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the main threat to any state’s position emanates from abroad. It is more important than ever for states to remain focused on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship to ensure the nation’s leadership in this fast-paced global industry – “especially as the national economy enters a challenging period.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastercures.org/about/whoweare/fastercures/CArradaza/"&gt;Cecilia Arradaza&lt;/a&gt;, Communications Director, &lt;em&gt;FasterCures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
