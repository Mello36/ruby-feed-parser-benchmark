We experimented by using sludge for fuel in the anode and the oxygen released by a water plant or algae as the oxidant in cathode. This process has been referred to simply as the bacterial electrolysis of organic matter because the protons and electrons are derived from the organic matter and not water.</p>
<p>This plan will be just an addition to an existing biogas plan where this plant will give electricity and semi treated water which will be passed to send filter then this water can be used for household purposes and semi-decomposed sludge will pass to biogas plant for further decomposition along with cow dung and crop residue.</p>
<p>Initial investment will be high but future output is very profitable. rural people will get electricity, water, and manure for farms and biogas as fuel and they can save lot of money. Again this will be provide job opportunity and extra manure and biogas can be sold to get income.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-201" title="Andy Posner" src="http://mtv-venture.org/switch/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/andyposnerheadshot-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Andy Posner, 24, USA</strong> - Van Jones and others are showing how a green collar economy can solve both social and environmental problems. My idea is to take that one step further by using the power of micro-credit and targeted green entrepreneurship training and mentoring to ensure that the green businesses of tomorrow are started by women, people of color, and low-income individuals, all of whom have been traditionally left out of the old, &#8220;grey&#8221; economy.</p>
<p>By providing affordable loans of $500 to $10,000 and combining them with additional support and training, my initiative will create jobs, a more vibrant, inclusive green economy, and solve environmental problems through the power of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I am working with experts in the fields of business skills and green job training to create a curriculum to support the entrepreneurs. In addition, I have spent the last five months laying a groundwork for the creation of a micro-finance program in Providence, Rhode island&#8211;a city with both high unemployment and poverty rates.</p>
<p>Working collaboratively with a number of community partners, a &#8220;buzz&#8221; has already been generated in the community. The impact of this program will be that all entrepreneurs with great, green ideas will have the chance to realize their dreams.</p>

In this movement that is named <strong>ecofit</strong>, we are selling solar chargers for cell phones, ipod. And a wristband distintive from our group that comes with a small booklet that says simple ways of helping with the global warming issue.</p>
<p>A percentage will be given to a foundation that helps ecology. We are negotiating with maple.org and pro valle.  We think it&#8217;s a very accessible way to show Mexican people how they can start using renewable energy.</p>
<p>Publicity is made through our blog http://exafit.blogspot.com, and our groups in facebook and hi5.</p>

To decrease and halt greenhouse gas emissions we must replace polluting energy sources like oil and coal with clean energy technologies like wind and solar. While these technologies function safely and efficiently, they&#8217;re not widely used in the United States.</p>
<p>Young Americans, who will be most effected by global climate change, feel unable to control energy production sources, and many Americans don&#8217;t see wind as a practical choice.</p>
<p>My project will empower young people by bringing together a group of high school students over the summer to build a working wind turbine. The turbine will provide power for a local demonstration farm, which hosts a day camp. The turbine will provide both clean energy and an example of implementing wind power on a small scale. Visitors will learn about wind energy&#8217;s ability to ameliorate climate change and provide local energy.</p>
<p>The wind turbine team will share our experiences and technical know-how with local schools and businesses. Through workshops, and using the working turbine as an exemplar, we will educate the community on wind energy solutions. We plan to inspire further construction of wind turbines at local schools and businesses.</p>

I’ll install LED and CFL bulbs in a test location. I will do this at the beginning of an electrical bill cycle so that the reduced energy costs can be tracked on the bulletin board for people to see how this effort can save them money.</p>
<p>I will install many different types of bulbs and wattages, so that people will understand that they can get the same effect as incandescents with new, more sustainable lighting options. LED lights use only about 4% of the energy used in an incandescent, and can last for thirty years. The cost/benefit analysis of each option will be highlighted so that people can decide how quick of a payback they will need.</p>
<p>Educating the public through my brochures, presentations, and articles in the newspapers help make them aware of the potential energy and cost savings, potential problems associated with m ercury in CFLs, and ways to face those problems. Making CFL recycling bins available provides a way for conscientious citizens to recycle CFLs. I’ll also teach about LEDs, which will soon become the most cost-effective bulb choice.</p>

<p>We talked with idling car and bus drivers about the pros, cons, health hazards, and pollution factors of idling.  As of  this spring of 2008, 6 months after we began the project, we did not see any buses or cars idling.  We plan on continuing to monitor the amount of idling on  our  campus.</p>
