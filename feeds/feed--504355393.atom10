			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="top" />The Company has agreed to the Union’s request to allow our members that can afford to do so, and that still have room in their RRSP fund, to deposit the entire $2,000 signing bonus directly into your Xstrata Sunlife RRSP account, tax free.</p>
<p>Members will have until Friday, November 14th at 8:00 AM to decide whether they wish to take advantage of this offer. Otherwise, the $2,000 signing bonus will be paid out on Thursday, November 20th. Assignment forms will be available at the gatehouse.</p>
<p>Also take note of the fact that any vacation days that had been pre-approved for the period of our work stoppage that had not already been paid out, will also be paid on November 20th. </p>
<p>Members that were charged with criminal offences during the strike have been suspended for between 1 and 5 days, but they will not be losing their job due to what the Company calls “inappropriate strike line activity”. Your Bargaining Committee will be grieving each and every suspension that has resulted from these alleged offences.</p>
<p>The last time I woke up we were still living in a country where the rule of law counted for something. As far as I know, you are still considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Suspending our members before they have had their day in court is totally inappropriate.</p>
<p>Many of our members are very angry at the Company’s decision to suspend these members for reacting in what they consider to be inappropriate behaviour. </p>
<p>Many of our members consider the fact that the Company has forced us out on strike in 3 out of 4 rounds of bargaining to be inappropriate behaviour.</p>
<p>Many of our members are not happy with the fact that the Company continues to try to divide our membership from its union leadership and consider that to be inappropriate. </p>
<p>I would encourage each and every member to voice their objection to these suspensions to their supervisors. The criminal charges that have been laid against our brothers by the police are unsubstantiated and have been blown way out of proportion. </p>
<p>In the meantime however, I would also encourage each and every member to follow SOP’s with diligence. Given the Company’s actions since October 1st, that would be good advice, as failing to do so could result in more inappropriate Company behaviour.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="top" />Your Bargaining Committee unanimously recommends acceptance of the Tentative Agreement reached between Xstrata Copper Canada and the unionize employees at their Kidd Metallurgical Site dated October 5th, 2008.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) of $0.75 will be rolled into the base rate</p>
<p>Wages – 3.25 %, 3.0%, 2% + COLA</p>
<p>Example for a current Code 5 P&amp;M Employee:</p>
<p>$26.53 add $0.75 COLA adjustment = $27.28<br />
$27.28 x 3.25% = $28.17 effective October 1st, 2008<br />
$28.17 x 3.00% = $29.02 effective October 1st, 2009<br />
$29.02 x 2.00% = $29.60 effective October 1st, 2010 plus COLA</p>
<p>Total wage increase at Code 5 equals $1.43 per hour plus 2008 COLA roll-in of $0.75 for a total of $2.18 per hour, not including projected cost of living increases in the third year of the contract</p>
<p>Signing Bonus - $2,000</p>
<p>Shift Premiums - 	10 hour shift workers will be paid $0.55/hour after 4:00 PM,<br />
an increase of 15 cents per hour</p>
<p>12 hour shift workers will be paid $0.65/hour after 4:00 PM,<br />
an increase of 20 cents per hour</p>
<p>Family Day has been added to the agreement</p>
<p>Local Education Fund will be increased by 3 cents/hour worked</p>
<p>Apprentices will receive a $500 Tool Allowance over the life of the agreement and their time away at trade school will no longer be held against them for vacation credits and annual production/productivity bonuses. Previously agreed upon SUB Plan agreements remain in place and the Joint Apprenticeship Committee will make recommendations to the Company regarding any previous experience</p>
<p><strong>Dental Plan</strong></p>
<p>There will now only be a two year lag based on the ODA Rates in effect January<br />
1st, 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Vision Care Plan</strong></p>
<p>Increased from $250 every two years to $325 every two years which includes eye exams</p>
<p><strong>Extended Health Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Elimination of $300 cap per service with overall paramedical maximum of $1,000/person/year</p>
<p>Medical Form reimbursement increased from $10 to $25</p>
<p>The Company will allow the union representatives access to Medical Insurance Carriers in order to help resolve issues regarding our members’ claims for benefits</p>
<p>The Company has committed to cooperate with the full-time worker Health and Safety representative in providing required information in a timely manner</p>
<p>If an employee’s contributory portion of any benefit plan is in arrears due to his or her time off the job for an extended period of time due to illness or injury, repayments can be arranged on a reasonable schedule</p>
<p>The Company will allow Banked Time to be rolled over between contracts</p>
<p>Disciplinary suspensions now have a 36 month sunset clause and cannot be held against them instead of staying in the employee’s file indefinitely</p>
<p>The Company has agreed that the Joint Disability Management Committee will have input when any Job Posting requirements include medical assessments</p>
<p>Return to Work Protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one will lose vacation days, seniority or credits for production/productivity bonuses for time off the job while on strike</li>
<li>No one will be laid off or demoted as part of the Return to Work Agreement</li>
<li>Employees will return to work only after being notified by the Company</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="top" /><strong>BISSON WANTS MINISTER TO KEEP ONTC AWAY FROM XSTRATA STRIKE</strong></p>
<p><strong>QUEEN’S PARK</strong>—After questioning from Timmins-James Bay MPP Gilles Bisson last week, today Northern Development Minister Michael Gravelle said ONTC employees or equipment will no longer cross the Xstrata Mine picket line in Timmins.</p>
<p>During today’s Question Period, Bisson wanted assurances that this won’t happen again. <em>“The Minister says it won’t happen again but we will be monitoring the situation. We have word the ONTC is lending equipment to Xstrata so they can move their trains.”</em></p>
<p>Last week Bisson was upset to learn the ONTC crossed the picket line. He became more upset learning that the Minister claimed to have no knowledge of the incident. <em>“That’s a pretty scary thought, that the minister who’s responsible for the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission (ONTC) and ultimately the ONR was not aware that his managers crossed the picket line in order to train the management at Xstrata to run the rail system that runs ore from the mine to the metallurgical site.”</em></p>
<p>Bisson says the McGuinty Government must tell the ONTC to stay out of the area and allow the employees and the company to resolve their differences.  <em>“No staff or equipment of the crown should be on that site…period.”</em></p>
