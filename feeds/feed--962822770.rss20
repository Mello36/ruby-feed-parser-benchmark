			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s getting late so I&#8217;ll keep this short.</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been working a bit with <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/index.html" target="_blank">CouchDB</a> and trying to fully grasp the whole schema-free thing. I&#8217;m actually fond of Python objects, so I really wanted a way to work with arbitrary database fields as if they were object properties.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my intermediate class, <a href="http://dpaste.com/hold/93627/" target="_blank">CouchObject</a>.</p>
<p>The example here is particularly interesting because Item is actually two kinds of items: files and folders. They share many fields such as name, directory, and user_id. However, files have some additional fields: content_type and size. By using CouchObject, I can be cool and only store the fields necessary for the particular kind of Item in the CouchDB document.</p>
<p>I could also later add another type of object (really, I only have one right now) and all I&#8217;d need to do is define different names for all_fields.</p>
<p>Obviously it&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s 2 AM here and I wanted to share a little about what I&#8217;ve been doing in my free time. Feedback welcome.</p>
<p>P.S.Â  I&#8217;m a little scared about using exec and especially without knowing what type of stuff is being passed in the dictionary. Eeek.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Obviously I should not write code very late at night. I&#8217;m (*gasp*) actually a morning person. Thanks to everyone who pointed out that yes, exec is horrible when get/setattr would have done just fine. I&#8217;ve updated the code link accordingly. Thanks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to publish your comments anyways so I hope that&#8217;s okay. The quantity of responses is quite scary in itself since I don&#8217;t track how many people read my blog.</p>
<p>After the <a href="http://uncov.com/2007/12/20/pownce-is-still-alive" target="_blank">whole</a> <a href="http://www.thedeal.com/techconfidential/behind-the-money/blog/behind-the-money/leah-culver-lead-developer-of.php#comment-198305" target="_blank">fuss</a> about <a href="http://leahculver.com/2007/04/19/star-ratings/" target="_blank">rounding numbers</a>, I was considering changing the blog post to make myself look a bit better. I decided against this for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. My blog should reflect me and I do a lot of stupid things. For example, I regularly spill food on myself while eating. You would think that after 26 years of eating food, I&#8217;d be able to do that correctly. Obviously not.<br />
2. It wasn&#8217;t a big change. Really, like 3 lines of code. I had the right idea, even at 2 AM. I also knew I was probably doing something wrong. So yeah, not that bad.<br />
3. It&#8217;s good to be wrong sometimes. We all make mistakes. So now I&#8217;m declaring, yes, I wrote some stupid code and it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s okay for us all to write stupid code sometimes.*</p>
<p>* My blog was originally titled &#8220;Leah Culver&#8217;s Stupid Blog&#8221; before I decided &#8220;Leah Culver&#8221; was more professional. I think I might change it back.</p>
<p><strong>Update (part 2)</strong>: I forgot to mention that the couchdb lib I&#8217;m using is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/couchdb-python/" target="_blank">couchdb-python.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, I actually got a question from a reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey Leah,<br />
I just started following your django adventures as I&#8217;m wanting to get into it. Would you mind doing a post on your dev environment (machine, text editor, other favorite tools)? I&#8217;m basically looking for best of breed tools and figured I might as well go to the source.</p>
<p>Thanks. Keep on rockin.<br />
Scotty&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While I&#8217;m tempted to do my best <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Bad" target="_blank">Strong Bad</a> impression here, the question is actually a good one. To be truthful, I often change tools and am always looking for cool new stuff. Comments welcome!</p>
<p>The most important tool I use is <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>. Actually, any version control tool would work and I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://www.newartisans.com/blog_files/git.from.bottom.up.php" target="_blank">paper</a> on <a href="http://git.or.cz/" target="_blank">GIT</a> in my bathroom magazine rack for awhile. If you&#8217;re not using version control, DO IT. It doesn&#8217;t really matter what size project you&#8217;re working on either. I work solo on my side project and while it&#8217;s sad to see incremental revisions all by myself (although others DO have commit access cough, cough&#8230;), it&#8217;s nice to know that if my laptop were stolen or <strike>if I made a horrible mistake</strike> when I make a horrible mistake, I can easily get at my good code again. <a href="http://zigversion.com/" target="_blank">Zigversion</a> is my Subversion tool of choice, but <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a> is lovely too (and available for Windows).</p>
<p>Moving on&#8230; I develop on a Mac laptop (yes, <a href="http://leahculver.com/laser-etched-laptop/" target="_blank">that one</a>) and mainly use <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">Coda</a> as my text editor. I was using <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/" target="_blank">SubEthaEdit</a>, but the Pownce designer, <a href="http://pownce.com/dburka/" target="_blank">Daniel</a>, showed me Coda and I&#8217;m a sucker for pretty Mac things. I also <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/11/11/coda-16" target="_blank">heard they just released an update today</a>.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/administrator/en/index.html" target="_blank">MySQL Administrator</a> to view and update Pownce&#8217;s MySQL database tables on my local machine and just the plain console for running queries or updating the production site. I&#8217;ve heard good things about <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a> but I haven&#8217;t been motivated enough to check it out. For <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>, I love <a href="http://jan.prima.de/~jan/plok/archives/142-CouchDBX-Revival.html" target="_blank">CouchDBX for the Mac</a> and the <a href="http://aimee.mychores.co.uk/2008/09/08/post/323/" target="_blank">web interface</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what else I would call a development tool, but here&#8217;s some stuff I love on the Mac:</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/" target="_blank">Quicksilver</a>, to get at my apps very quickly<br />
- <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/" target="_blank">Adium</a>, for lots of chatty goodness across all my chat accounts<br />
- <a href="http://people.no-distance.net/ol/software/s3/" target="_blank">S3 Browser</a>, desktop app for managing S3 accounts<br />
- <a href="http://colloquy.info/" target="_blank">Colloquy</a>, more chatty IRC goodness<br />
- <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/" target="_blank">SSHKeychain</a>, because I&#8217;m lazy and forgetful<br />
- <a href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/" target="_blank">Fetch</a>, for ftp because I like watching the dog icon run<br />
- <a href="http://www.parallels.com/" target="_blank">Parallels</a>, to test Pownce in IE</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m forgetting something, but these are the ones I use almost daily. Let me know if I&#8217;m missing out on any more good stuff!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my hurry to make <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> (four months!), I didn&#8217;t really take the time to look into all the really nice features of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" title="Django web framework">Django</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;ve been working on a side project in my spare time and since I&#8217;m not pressed to complete it, I&#8217;ve taken my sweet time to explore some of the niceties of the Django framework. One of my favorite such niceties is the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#url" target="_blank">URL lookup template tags</a>.</p>
<p>For my side project, code named Tilde, I&#8217;d like to have a series of settings pages for various user settings such as profile information, S3 account information, and the user&#8217;s password. I have a series of links like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="/settings/profile/"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="/settings/account/"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="/settings/password/"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<p>My urls.py contains the mapping of these URLs to my Django views for the settings pages like so:</p>
<p><code>urlpatterns += patterns('tilde.account.views',<br />
(r'^settings/profile/$', 'settings_profile'),<br />
(r'^settings/account/$', 'settings_account'),<br />
(r'^settings/password/$', 'settings_password'),<br />
)</code></p>
<p>This works just fine&#8230; except it violates one of Django&#8217;s design philosophies - <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/#don-t-repeat-yourself-dry" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t repeat yourself (DRY)</a>. I really shouldn&#8217;t be hard-coding my URLs in my templates since I&#8217;ve already defined them in urls.py.</p>
<p>Instead, Django provides a built-in template tag, <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#url">url</a>,Â  to lookup a URL for a particular view. So now my settings tab URLs look like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="{% url tilde.account.views.settings_profile %}"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="{% url tilde.account.views.settings_account %}"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="{% url tilde.account.views.settings_password %}"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<p>This generates the same HTML as my first attempt, without having to hard-code any URLs. I could actually change the URL to any of these views without worrying about breaking any links on my site. Not that it&#8217;s a good idea to change around URLs on a live website, but it&#8217;s handy for development.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get a little bit more complex. I&#8217;m a big fan of re-using code so I&#8217;d like to re-use my views and forms from my S3 account settings page for my S3 account signup page.</p>
<p>So in tilde.account.views.py I have a basic S3 account view:</p>
<p><code>def account(request, template='signup_account.html'):<br />
# code for S3 account form<br />
...<br />
return render_to_response(template, {<br />
'form': form,<br />
}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))</code></p>
<p>And I have the following in my urls.py:</p>
<p><code>urlpatterns += patterns('tilde.account.views',<br />
(r'^signup/account/$', 'account'),<br />
(r'^settings/profile/$', 'settings_profile'),<br />
(r'^settings/account/$', 'account', {'template': 'settings/account.html'}),<br />
(r'^settings/password/$', 'settings_password'),<br />
)</code></p>
<p>And my settings links look like:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="{% url tilde.account.views.settings_profile %}"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="{% url tilde.account.views.account %}"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="{% url tilde.account.views.settings_password %}"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<p>Which unfortunately renders as:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="/settings/profile/"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="/signup/account/"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="/settings/password/"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve mapped two URLs to the same view, when I request the corresponding URL for tilde.account.views.account I get the first one defined in urls.py (/signup/account/) which is not the one I&#8217;m looking for! I could just switch the order, but then I couldn&#8217;t use the url template tag for the signup url and really, that&#8217;s cheating.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/#naming-url-patterns">name my URLs</a> to distinguish between the one for signup and the one for settings.</p>
<p><code>urlpatterns += patterns('tilde.account.views',<br />
url(r'^signup/account/$', 'account', name='signup_account'),<br />
url(r'^settings/profile/$', 'settings_profile', name='settings_profile'),<br />
url(r'^settings/password/$', 'settings_password', name='settings_password'),<br />
url(r'^settings/account/$', 'account', {'template': 'settings/account.html'}, name='settings_account'),<br />
)</code></p>
<p>I can then use these names in my template tags like so:<br />
<code><br />
&lt;a href="{% url settings_profile %}"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="{% url settings_account %}"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="{% url settings_password %}"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<p>Purty!! My settings links are now awesome.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;d like to go just a bit further and make them a bit more tab-like. That is, when I&#8217;m on a particular settings page, I&#8217;d like to have it just display text instead of a link so I know which page I&#8217;m on. I know I can get the current page&#8217;s path with request.path, so I can do the following:</p>
<p><code>{% ifequal request.path '/settings/profile/' %}<br />
&lt;span&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt;<br />
{% else %}<br />
&lt;a href="{% url settings_profile %}"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
{% endif %}<br />
{% ifequal request.path '/settings/account/' %}<br />
&lt;span&gt;Account&lt;/span&gt;<br />
{% else %}<br />
&lt;a href="{% url settings_account %}"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
{% endif %}<br />
{% ifequal request.path '/settings/password/' %}<br />
&lt;span&gt;Password&lt;/span&gt;<br />
{% else %}<br />
&lt;a href="{% url settings_password %}"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;<br />
{% endif %}</code></p>
<p>Blech. Resorting back to hard-coding the URLs is not cool and there&#8217;s no way I can put the url template tag inside another template tag!Â  In Django 1.0 and later, I can actually store the result of the url template tag into a value like so:</p>
<p><code>{% url settings_profile as url_profile %}</code></p>
<p>I can then use that variable in other template tags. (This actually breaks from Django convention a bit and smells like PHP, but it&#8217;s awfully useful, so I&#8217;ll let that go.)</p>
<p>My final settings links then look like this:</p>
<p><code>{% url settings_profile as url_profile %}<br />
{% url settings_account as url_account %}<br />
{% url settings_password as url_password %}<br />
{% ifequal request.path url_profile %}<br />
&lt;span&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt;<br />
{% else %}<br />
&lt;a href="{{ url_profile }}"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;<br />
{% endifequal %}<br />
{% ifequal request.path url_account %}<br />
&lt;span&gt;Account&lt;/span&gt;<br />
{% else %}<br />
&lt;a href="{{ url_account }}"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;<br />
{% endifequal %}<br />
{% ifequal request.path url_password %}<br />
&lt;span&gt;Password&lt;/span&gt;<br />
{% else %}<br />
&lt;a href="{{ url_password }}"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;<br />
{% endifequal %}</code></p>
<p>Nice! For more details about Django URL mapping, check out the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/">URL dispatcher docs</a>.</p>

<p>Here they are:</p>
<p>- Basic Authentication middleware (contrib.auth.middleware?), <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3609">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3609</a><br />
- S3 file backend (in contrib.files?) , <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6390">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6390</a><br />
- Dictionary to xml support for building APIs. The serializers for Django are a mess but <a href="http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson">simplejson</a> is lovely.<br />
- Context processors for the site name, site domain and url for use in templates. As defined by the project settings file and not contrib.sites (<a href="http://leahculver.com/2007/07/17/django-site-module/">which is my least favorite Django app</a>) please.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve custom built all these things for Pownce but now I&#8217;m working on a side project and am super annoyed that I need to port them over. Two apps with these custom features makes me think that they really should be in Django.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the side project is almost done and it uses Django with <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>. More details soon!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about an Apple product recall and some flip-flops.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I tripped over my iPhone cord.</p>
<p>All the outlets in my apartment are at floor level and I plug my iPhone into the wall outlet nearest my bed. As usual, I was wearing flip-flops (as many computer programmers do) and the cord got caught between my toes and the sole.</p>
<p>The result was that I pulled the adapter out of the wall, breaking off one of the prongs. I had a metal prong sticking out of the outlet!</p>
<p><a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/3470359/" title="prong in outlet" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/3470359/" title="prong in outlet" target="_blank"><img src="http://leahculver.com/images/adapter-1.png" border="0" height="379" width="504" /></a></p>
<p>Freaked out about getting electricuted, I left it alone for a few days. The Pownce community offered <a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/3470359/">some practical and creative ways</a> for me to remove the prong, but having previous experiene with electric shocks (freshman physics class) I had no desire try my luck.</p>
<p>I went out and bought a new adapter.</p>
<p><a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/3475896/" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/3475896/" target="_blank"><img src="http://leahculver.com/images/adapter-2.png" alt="new apple power adapter" border="0" height="498" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Then, Thursday during work, I tripped over a printer cable when it got caught in my flip-flop! Ethan from the podcast <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1698191/wsyk_25_sarah_palin/">What Should You Know</a>, works next to the printer so I told him the story of the iPhone adapter prong. Apparently he knows a lot (hence the podcast) and pointed out that one prong wouldn&#8217;t connect the circuit (duh) so I should just pull it out.</p>
<p>When I got home I was feeling more confident and a bit silly. I got out a pair of rubber-handled pliers and gingerly touched the prong with the tip of the pliers. Nothing. Yay! I yanked out the lone prong and threw it away.</p>
<p>I thought that would be the end of the story.</p>
<p>Oh no&#8230; Yesterday, Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/usbadapter/exchangeprogram/">recalled the particular adapter</a>, citing</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;that under certain conditions the new ultracompact Apple USB power adapter&#8217;s metal prongs can break off and remain  					in a power outlet, creating a risk of electric shock.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever actually caused the recall, just let me keep thinking it was my flip-flops.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyURL" target="_blank">short url</a> for Pownce permalink pages for an upcoming project. Pownce note permalink pages on the website currently look like this: <a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/2477365/">http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/2477365/</a></p>
<p>The generic form is:  http://pownce.com/&lt;sender username&gt;/note/&lt;note id&gt;/</p>
<p>While these URLs are pretty descriptive and simple, they&#8217;re also a bit long. The note id is really the only piece of information we need from the URL, the sender username is just fluff. I&#8217;d like to have an alternate URL that is quite a lot shorter that redirects to the final (longer) URL.</p>
<p>I think the following set of characters look pretty good in URLs:<br />
23456789abcdefghijkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ<br />
Basically, 0-9a-zA-Z minus the confusing characters: 01loIO.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s fairly simple to convert a base 10 note id to this strange base 56 set assuming that the character order (digit-lower-upper) is maintained. The (very freshman-like) <a href="http://dpaste.com/hold/57153/">code is here</a>.</p>
<p>The result is something like http://pownce.com/~g7YF/ will redirect to <a href="http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/2477365/">http://pownce.com/leahculver/notes/2477365/</a></p>
<p>This works very well for finding a note page based off a note id. It&#8217;s also super handy for making a generic tiny-urlizing service. The only data that needs to be stored is the real URL and a numerical id - the unique primary key for the database row! I have no desire to run a tiny-urlizing service, but this would probably be how I&#8217;d do it.</p>
<p>Note: Pownce user profile pages are in the form http://pownce.com/&lt;username&gt;/ so a non-username character, such as &#8216;~&#8217; can signify that this is a note permalink as oppose to a profile page. I like the tilde, it&#8217;s got style&#8230; a bit confusing for the Unix folks though. Since it&#8217;s the code isn&#8217;t in production yet, other character suggestions are welcome.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pownce.com" target="_blank">Pownce</a> is the best way to share media with your friends online and one of the best parts of Pownce is the embedded images and video. When you post a link-type note with a URL to an image site such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, the Pownce website displays a thumbnail of that image. Video links display an embedded video player for sites such as <a href="http://www.ustream.tv" target="_blank">Ustream</a>, <a href="http://qik.com" target="_blank">Qik</a>, or <a href="http://viddler.com" target="_blank">Viddler</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://leahculver.com/images/pownce-flickr.png" align="left" border="0" height="200" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="250" />At Pownce, we were adding these new video and photo service embeds on a case-by-case basis with custom code for each site. As we got more requests for supporting different services, we realized that we didn&#8217;t want to pick and choose which services we would implement. We want to support as many services as possible!</p>
<p>While at dinner with <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/" target="_blank">Cal Henderson</a> (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bees" target="_blank">Flickr</a>), <a href="http://immike.net/" target="_blank">Mike Malone</a> (<a href="http://pownce.com/mmalone/" target="_blank">Pownce</a>), and <a href="http://rcrowley.org/" target="_blank">Richard Crowley</a> (OpenDNS), we chatted about this problem and chatted about creating an open standard for accessing embed code from a URL via an API endpoint. Cal drafted up the initial spec for this standard overnight and we named it <a href="http://oembed.com" target="_blank">OEmbed</a> (or oEmbed).</p>
<p><a href="http://oembed.com" target="_blank">OEmbed</a> is an open web API standard for fetching embed code based on a URL. The spec is fairly simple and can be found at oembed.com.<img src="http://leahculver.com/images/pownce-viddler.png" align="right" border="0" height="237" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="250" /></p>
<p>Since creating OEmbed, we&#8217;ve been working with various photo and video sites to implement this standard. OEmbed is currently supported by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.viddler.com/" target="_blank">Viddler</a>, <a href="http://qik.com/" target="_blank">Qik</a>, <a href="http://pownce.com/" target="_blank">Pownce</a>, <a href="http://revision3.com/" target="_blank">Revision3</a> and <a href="http://www.hulu.com/" target="_blank">Hulu</a>. <a href="http://vimeo.com/" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> and <a href="http://blip.tv/" target="_blank">Blip.tv</a> are currently working on implementations. Pownce is the first consumer of OEmbed; we use these APIs to display inline images and video on the Pownce site. We&#8217;ve been working with <a href="http://digg.com" target="_blank">Digg</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to use OEmbed for story and share embeds.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited about gaining more support and feedback for OEmbed. If you work on a photo or video sharing site and are interested in adding OEmbed to your API or if you&#8217;d like to use OEmbed as a consumer, please join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oembed" target="_blank">Google Group</a> - we&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I receive a weekly email from travel social networking site <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/">Dopplr</a> telling me all about people&#8217;s trips. Sadly, these are people (spam bots?) I don&#8217;t know or really care about. How did that happen?? Here&#8217;s how I imagine it happened&#8230;</p>
<p>Dopplr-tard: &#8220;Let&#8217;s get rid of mutual friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social Media Fanboy: &#8220;Like <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dopplr-tard: &#8220;Twitter is so hot right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social Media Fanboy: &#8220;But my location should be private unless I share it with someone else!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dopplr-tard: &#8220;Well, how about the opposite? I choose to share trips with you! Then you can see anything I send you and we don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social Media Fanboy: &#8220;Brilliant! But what if I don&#8217;t want to see someone&#8217;s trips?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dopplr-tard: &#8220;Then you can just &#8216;mute&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>ON A ONE-BY-ONE BASIS.</p>
<p>Useless and a complete waste of any Cute Girl&#8217;s time. I&#8217;d quit the service except that their Facebook app is pretty and I have some major carbon guilt.</p>
<p>Update: Matt, I like Dopplr and you can do so much better than this. Please bring back mutual friends and friend requests.</p>
