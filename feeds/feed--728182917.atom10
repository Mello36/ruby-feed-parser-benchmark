			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peace does not come until you are free. Free in mind and free in heart.</p>
<p>Free from a mind that doesn&#8217;t want to hear and free from a heart that is heavy.</p>
<p>Here is why: We focus our self on what we think&#8230;and so often we know we are right.  We know what we know. Other ideas&#8230;we simply don&#8217;t want to deal with. It takes time and effort to dissovle a new way of looking at something.  We are busy&#8230;aren&#8217;t we? And our ego may get in the way,also.  In addition, when our heart is heavy, it can consume us. We can easily dwell on the difficulties - and tragedies -  of life. We can dwell on it and we don&#8217;t realize until it is lifted from us. A heavy heart leads to a lonely heart. Heaviness makes us look inward.  When we look inward, our shortcomings are evident - even if we don&#8217;t want to admit it even to ourselves, but the emptiness is still there -  and we can be in despair on how to fix it.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. To be free we have to take a step towards freedom. This is not easy. Let me repeat. This is not easy. It takes courage&#8230;and sometimes a lot of courage.  Then our pride gets in the way. Pride is the chains on our life and breaking through our pride - even for a few minutes - can show us to the path of peace.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION: </strong>Take all the courage you can muster. Put aside pride for the next few minutes. Ask God for help. Then read the Book of John in the bible. Peace to you.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Peace...when I want things.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How about this one?  You want many things&#8230;a home, a new car, more money, happiness, more peace, more leisure time, more&#8230;whatever.   And your ethics come from yourself only. You don&#8217;t get into others telling you what is right. You don&#8217;t get like churches, in particular.</p>
<p>Here is the tension&#8230;the squeeze.  It is self centered. Your ethics come from you that give you the framework to get what you want. You determine the moral way to get what you want. Maybe self centered is ok, you may say.</p>
<p>But self centered becomes a very dreary existence. Relationships are superficial. You carry guilt that never goes away.</p>
<p>There is a way out of the squeeze. There is a better way. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION: </strong>Psalms 32:1 says &#8220;Happy is the person whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned.&#8221;  Talk to God.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Where can we find hope?]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You bet&#8230;especially if you put all your hope in it.</p>
<p>Is there another way&#8230; ?</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I lose all my money, I still hope in myself. &#8220;  And you have to have confidence in yourself otherwise you can&#8217;t get out of bed in the morning.  But here is the problem.</p>
<p>Our money can fail us and even we ourselves can fail in our own betterment&#8230;.at times. If the global economy goes to 15-20%+ inflation&#8230;what can we do as a person? This can get rather despairing.  We indeed have our own limits&#8230;money and our abilities&#8230;or our capacities.</p>
<p>This is one reason why Christians look outside themselves for peace and hope. It is not easy to say I do not have all the answers or solutions. But it is very interesting that some very famous Christians did not worry. Mother Theresa of India&#8230;didn&#8217;t worry.  Corrie ten Boom&#8230;didn&#8217;t worry. They really did find peace.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION: </strong>Read about Mother Theresa and Corrie ten Boom. Or read about St Francis who gave up family riches to live a life without worry.  These people are worth learning about and discovering how they found peace. They may have thoughts for you.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How we respond to life...makes all the difference.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You react to events around you and you may pay a very high price.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The bad stock market. You get angry and bitter towards big government and big business. Or maybe you react by wanting big government to attack big business or the other way around. If not controlled, your bitterness, will not stay there&#8230;it will creep into your life. You are bitter about life and others.  &#8220;They are better off&#8221; or you are simply suffering and want more.</p>
<p>Gas prices. You are angry and bitter towards big gas companies. They are reaping all the money and you support them. It makes you angry.</p>
<p>Marriage. She left me. He left me.  You are angry.</p>
<p>Job. They want more from and same pay. This can make you very unappreciated and angry.</p>
<p>If you do not understand what is happening, you will become bitter and a very unpleasant person to be around. Yes? !</p>
<p>When we become bitter, it&#8217;s like all other responses are automatic. We don&#8217;t control ourselves. We say or do unkind or stupid things. Why did I do that?</p>
<p>Our response can maddening..when we look it outside of our self&#8230;look at yourself.</p>
<p>Time to stop the madness. Think about life.</p>
<p>Or &#8230;&#8230;.you can look for hope. Something better. Somehow it will get better.</p>
<p>Where do you place all your hope? In self? You become all about self, then. Self interest and greed become a way of life.  Greed is why the US is in the place it is today. Greed is the madness of the US&#8230;and the world.</p>
<p>How do you stop the madness?</p>
<p>Your response is really a response of hope. Where is hope?</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION: </strong>Consider where you place your hope. Is it empty?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greed in the US has come home to roost. Government had policies of greed. Fannie Mae wanted more business and beauracrats wanted more power. Mortgage companies had their greed. They wanted more. The consumer wanted more.</p>
<p>Everyone benefited as greed fed greed.</p>
<p>Now greed again wants to bailout the mess. Greed wants more. It never ends. The &#8220;City of Greed&#8221; (Washington, DC) wants to fix it.</p>
<p>It never ends with us as people. Until we recognize what greed is, - and its addiction - we will want more. But get me right - there is nothing wrong with wanting a better life. When it is beyond one&#8217;s needs is when greed can destroy. If only, we could be satisfied. &#8230;and there is a way. But that is for later.</p>
<p>Cry the Beloved country. We as people, have become greedy to where we elect greedy politicians who represent us. It is time for the people of the US (and the world), to call it what it is.</p>
<p>Stop the Madness</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speak about love does not mean you know love&#8230;.or that you live love.</p>
<p>Can you hear love?</p>
<p>People can be so full of greed and self interest that they only mouth the words of love.  You say, you are not full of greed or self interest. OK.</p>
<p>Please read on.</p>
<p>There is a love beyond ourselves. It is a love that truly puts the other person ahead of your wants and even your needs.  This is true love. I am not talking about romantic love.</p>
<p>The love I am talking about is a submission of self to another with nothing in return.  Did you hear that?</p>
<p>Very often we have love and it can be so great and so full of service&#8230;and so good&#8230;but it has a payback to you. You feel better about helping. You feel good about yourself. You have helped mankind. &#8220;I am good since I have done this good service.&#8221;</p>
<p>The love I am talking about is the love of Jesus. Submission of self to another with nothing in return.</p>
<p>This is not easy. Especially when we have our portraits of love and service around us. I go to church. I helped at a soup kitchen. I am not a nasty person. I care.</p>
<p>The love of Jesus is the love of submission to another with nothing in return. Yes, it does cost. Then you can know love&#8230;and attempt to live it.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION: </strong>Make a comment to this post and state  your hesitations are or your objections.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all do at one time or another&#8230;and it&#8217;s not always bad..sometimes it is good.  But I&#8217;m talking about the important stuff.</p>
<p>One example: what do we do with our guilt?  Maybe you say &#8220;What have I done wrong? I&#8217;ve tried my best in life. Maybe have made some mistakes but I certainly do not feel guilty about myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know, one of the very &#8220;good&#8221; people in life has said this, in essence: The good things about my life are filthy rags. He was a very humble person&#8230;and didn&#8217;t stop from calling injustice what it is..injustice.</p>
<p>Why would he say, my good deeds in life are filthy? I think it has to do with not being able to measure up to God&#8217;s justice. God is truth and then there is nothing fake about God&#8230;or unjust&#8230;or half hearted.</p>
<p>The followers of Jesus, before his death, were a very unimpressive group.  One would shoot his mouth off, some could not read, afraid to ask questions, jealous of each other and their place in the group,  wanted violence, little stamina, little faith or no faith, one was a tax cheat (like an IRS agent who steals from taxpayers), one stole money from the group, some were racist, and they all ran away in fear in time of trouble.  I am not exaggerating. This is how they are presented in history.</p>
<p>After the death of Jesus&#8230;they changed. They saw something that they could not let go of. </p>
<p>One thing they could not let go of was the goodness of God and how deficient we are and how much we do not measure up. Jesus told them to go out and tell people about the good news of how they can be reconciled with God. </p>
<p>Then this is the amazing thing:</p>
<p>They all did it.  They didn&#8217;t run away in fear. They were no longer afraid. They were no longer a cheat. They were no longer weak. They were actually brave. </p>
<p>How did this happen? I think they knew they way to get rid of the guilt. They knew now, how to be reconciled to God. ..and they preached about it. They obviously were changed by something very important to them. </p>
<p>They no longer bought into false ideas. They knew the truth. </p>
<p>And they preached&#8230;and they all died violently except for John who died abandoned on an island by the government, it was his prison&#8230;his sentence.</p>
<p>Each could have recanted their following Jesus. Not one did. </p>
<p><b>SUGGESTED ACTION: </b>Consider your life and your shortcomings. Read the book of John in the bible and see how much God loves you, no matter what in your life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is.</p>
<p>Children are.</p>
<p>A spouse is.</p>
<p>Having a home is.</p>
<p>Food is.</p>
<p>And yet it seems, we go about our life as if they weren&#8217;t precious. Our busy-ness keeps us distracted. We have so much and so often we value so little&#8230;or we forget to value&#8230;until we lose things.</p>
<p>There is something that we can never lose and it will always be precious. It is always there. </p>
<p>A evangelist, many years ago, said our faith is more precious than gold and the promises in faith are also precious.</p>
<p>I  absolutely agree but we can&#8217;t see this preciousness unless we have faith and we live our faith. If we have faith in ourselves&#8230;I would not call that precious..however the world we live in certainly may&#8230;or how about the person who says that knowledge of God and spiritual matters come from within yourself and not from sources outside of yourself,&#8230;they may call faith in myself precious.  What about faith that aliens will come and save us (Scientology)? What about faith in your finances? What about faith in your personal skills? </p>
<p>The faith the evangelist was talking about was quite exactly, faith that Jesus Christ, born 2,000 years ago, was killed and because of his death, he paid the ransom to retrieve us out of the hands of the consequences of evil. To prove this, Jesus came alive after his death and people saw him leave this world into heaven. The promise to us is that we too can join him when we die&#8230;and we are released from the guilt we accumulate in life. </p>
<p>This faith is not about ourselves and our goodness or attempted goodness. It is not about a nice book we read that makes us feel good. It is not about making others look trivial in their faith but yours is more advanced and better. </p>
<p>This kind of faith in Jesus, is indeed precious. But only if you stop looking through the window from the outside and come in and see with your eyes and your heart how lives can be changed and a new life can begin and begin again each day. If you don&#8217;t know what I am talking about or are unsure&#8230;.oh please talk to me or someone who has this precious faith.</p>
<p><b>SUGGESTED ACTION: </b>Think about the good things around you. Think about how fragile some things are. Think about having faith in unfaithful and temporary things. Read in the bible the section entitled &#8220;John&#8221;.      </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China&#8217;s earthquake is because of bad karma&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;when you&#8217;re not nice-bad things happen to you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.the world according to Sharon Stone&#8230;.at the Cannes film festival last week.</p>
<p>Why have faith in karma, when you can have faith in who created the world and all that it has and all that is in it.  In fact, in Genesis a book in the Bible,  says that God called what was created&#8230;good. Not partially good&#8230;.but good.</p>
<p>How then did bad things enter into the world?</p>
<p>You can say that people use the world wrongly. But how did we know how to do wrong? &#8230;even though we think it is right.  Where did this disconnect come from?</p>
<p>Much of what is wrong in the world is because of pride and greed&#8230;.and where did pride and greed come from?   If the mountains are good, the trees are good, rivers are good&#8230;where did the bad come from?</p>
<p>The book of Genesis says it came from evil &#8230;.not bad karma.  The evil and wicked influences in our society are great..always looking for somebody to affect.   Anger can overtake me&#8230;yet I may not cause my anger.  It simply erupts.  The neat thing is this:  The God of Genesis promises hope.  Hope that can eliminate the past  wrongs and the present disconnects that affect the soul of our life.</p>
<p>The hope of Genesis wants to renew a person&#8217;s life. The hope promised in Genesis has come and now is seeking people to follow.  The hope of Genesis has people today that are seeking others to join in the &#8220;following&#8221;&#8230;.to join in the community&#8230;.to join in the hope&#8230;..to join in the  peace&#8230;&#8230;to join in the love of God.</p>
<p>Oh, would you consider to join?</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION: </strong>Read in the Bible, the book of John. In particular, read and consider John 6:26-40.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Truth is something someone makes up.  or  Truth is something a scientist has found.  or Truth is what somebody has discovered.  or Truth is inside us. or Truth can be told to us.  or I have my Truth &#8230;and you have yours.  &#8230;well what is it?</p>
<p>The problem with truth is that it affects our entire life.</p>
<p>What is the truth about my successes&#8230;my failures&#8230;my relationships&#8230;my character&#8230;.my virtues&#8230;my faults ?</p>
<p>When we honestly come to grips with the &#8220;truth&#8221; , then we have taken the first step to self improvement. We then know what needs improving.</p>
<p>The truth about ourself is one thing&#8230;and the truth about our relationships and other life issues  are another.</p>
<p>It is interesting, Christianity says the first step is to acknowledge the truth about ourselves then the truth about other things, will come next. Makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED ACTION:  </strong>What is the truth about yourself?  What is the truth about your relationships? What about your successes? What about your failures?   Does your pride hinder you or does it propel you and is there a cost?  In this process, you may learn more about truth&#8230;and the truth about yourself.</p>
