        <![CDATA[<p>As we get to the end of 2008 the predictions for what will happen next year start coming out.  In the PC space it looks generally like it will be a continuation of the same process we have seen recently.  Die sizes for chips will get smaller, hard drives will get larger capacities, and video cards will continue to increase in speed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/the-hottest-pc-technology-for-2009-492734">Tech Radar</a> have put together a good summary on the main movements we will likely see in the PC space.  Outside of some niche markets though, there is little need for us to have faster computers.  The thrust of the technology change for the general and corporate user is going to continue towards smaller and lower power.</p>

<p>Intel have a new 32nm chips coming out next year with 22nm and 16nm to follow by 2012 and 2015ish.  Given that they are not already touting the power and speed benefits of the new sizes yet, the incremental change in power per watt is probably less than has previously been seen.  A number of new materials have gone into this technology which might be the cause of this, otherwise it could mean that speed and heat advantages from miniturisation could be disappearing.</p>

<p>If this is the case then processor advancement may stall for some time until a radically new technology comes to light.</p>

<p>In the past couple of years the PC has taken a backseat to gadgets in generating interest and entusiasm.  It does not look like this will change in 2009.</p>

<p>Some more detail on the <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/html_tmp/content-view-40519-135.html">32nm chips</a>.</p>]]>

My team at RawVoice has had to really weigh which event to attend and now its a no brainer.</p>
<p>I will be registering RawVoice to exhibit at the event in October of 2009. I really wish though that event was not in Las Vegas again as that is gonna keep some people away. The Podcasting Community is a tight knit group and it is hard to embrace the social aspects of the community in Vegas. </p>
<p>Being a big advocate of blogging in combination with podcasting though this is a great fit and should be a great event. We will have a chance to reach bloggers who have been considering being a new media creators.</p>
<p>I will be reaching out to the blogworld and new media expo team and hopefully we can help them make the event one that the podcasting community will embrace.</p>
<p>Mark your calendars for October 15&ndash;17<sup>th</sup> mine is!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>So I decided I wanted to update my TV Capture card. I use it only for one thing - to capture my camera for live streaming. I don't care about remote controls, I only care that it had an antenna and S-Video input. I got a deal on an ATI Theatre 550 capture card - which is a PCI Express card - And should push the video better than my old Hauppage card I bought years ago. </p>

<p>I have yet to be impressed. </p>

<p>Let's start out in saying I stopped buying ATI years ago because their video has always had problems. I had an ATI Rage 128 card and the performance never hit what I expected. I ended switching up to NVidia graphics cards and never looked back. NVidia has some solid hardware and software that has never really failed me. </p>

<p>But my last ATI card I bought was years ago. Maybe things changed - ATI was bought out by AMD, new technologies and advancements could make things better. It didn't. </p>

<p>I got the card yesterday. I need to preface this by saying it is a OEM card. I was able to download and install the main drivers. However, the other software wouldn't install. It kept telling me I need a specific piece of software.</p>

<p>I went to the webpage and scoured for software. The pages took me from ATI pages to AMD pages and back. When I finally got frustrated, I found the customer support phone number. Only thing was it is AMD's support, not ATI. I called the number and AMD said that there was another phone number, but it wasn't on the website. He gave me the number and said that they were on the East Coast and are closed for the day. </p>

<p>This morning I called to find out what I can do. Instantly after I mentioned the card the support agent goes "This is an OEM version". He then told me that ATI doesn't support and there is no way to tell me who I can get the drivers from. </p>

<p>I was floored. Not the fact about the OEM part - OEM items are sold to companies like Dell to put in their machines. There is usually no support from the main company. I WAS floored that he couldn't turn me in the right direction. </p>

<p>What is more annoying is in this day and age software and drivers don't take up much webspace and could easily be cataloged for customers. So what if it's OEM? Put it all on one FTP site. </p>

<p>I did download some free software that lets me tune into my video feed. When I went to broadcast, the video was latent. When I spoke, the audio came through first, then 2 seconds later the video pushed through. </p>

<p>The funny part is after this guy pretty much locked up his stance on the card, I said "Ya know, I stopped using ATI years ago because of quality and support. I guess things haven't changed". He replied with "Thank you." We ended the call there.</p>

<p>I took a chance at getting an OEM card. Granted, I didn't spend that much, however, when I ever bought other OEM cards I have always been able to find drivers and software and never had a problem. I am switching back to the old card and taking that ATI card back. </p>]]>

When I looked at the price of the <a href="http://www.mogulus.com/broadcast/main" target="_blank">Mogulus Pro </a>offering I just about fell out of my chair.</p>
<p>Their prices start at $350.00 a month with only 25gb of bandwidth allowance, plus if you bust your 25gb cap you will be charged $1.50 per gig. <u><strong>Someone over there is smoking crack</strong></u>. </p>
<p>They must think content producers are stupid. I have used a variety of paid streaming services for about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> the monthly cost they are planning on charging, and have been able to have my own branded player and many of the other options that are offering with this pro-offering.</p>
<p>This is a opportunity for all of those companies that have been streaming live content for years to step up and compete with Mogulus on their pro-offering.&nbsp; I was fully expecting Mogulus or Ustream to come out with pricing that was aggressive, not pricing that is more expensive than many competitors in the space.</p>
<p>They will have to come up with an offering that makes sense. I think in order to get people like me to consider signing up for their pro-service it is going to have to be an offering a monthly price range in the $100-$150 range along with a healthy initial bandwidth offering. </p>
<p>I hope that Ustream.TV does not make the same mistake as Mogulus has made, because it is evident to me that with their pricing scheme they have not targeted content creators like me.<br /></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I have been beefing up my websites. I also have been working on some external projects hard. But all of that came to a crashing halt last week.</p>

<p>Why? I got sick. </p>

<p>I felt this illness coming down on Monday (Nov. 24th). I didn't think much of it, but after my Podcast on Tuesday, I pretty much knew I should take some downtime and relax a bit while ingesting something like lots of Liquids. (Here is a keynote - If you have a fever and your lips start to dry out quick, you might want to get some water in your system. )</p>

<p>By Thursday I was pretty much on the back and forth thing - Morning I would be OK, but then by evening I was burning up and freezing at the same time. Saturday I had to play with the band and by the end of the 3rd set I was hurting more than I ever hurt before. If it wasn't for the little catnaps between breaks, I would have probably not made it. </p>

<p>Monday - Feeling better but coughing entered into the mix. Still did my shows. Tuesday - Coughing getting worse. Still did my Podcast - then took a 3 hour nap before going to a local Podcasters meeting I started up here. Wednesday - After 3 PM I went downstairs, plopped in front of the TV and stayed there all evening. </p>

<p>Now it's Thursday and although I am still not 100%, I have to catch up on everything I've missed. I planned to post some videos, but they've been sitting on the back burner. I planned a couple GeekNewsCentral Articles, but once again, back burner. Even the contract stuff I do pretty much was set aside as I couldn't focus or concentrate. </p>

<p>The funny thing is that I could have done any of the stuff in question. With technology today I could have laid on the couch and put the videos together. I might not have been able to write the articles, but I could've at least put together some notes. </p>

<p>It's interesting how an illness can debilitate a person. Thinking "I can do it when I'm better", then when you are more level headed you realize how much more stress you put on yourself. Still, when you are sick, you really need to put some attention to getting better. </p>

<p>I am not sure how much longer this will go on. I keep hearing "Everybody's getting this bug". Hopefully it's not something that might warrant a doctor visit. But I do know that it's time to start catching up on my projects or else I might find myself in a hole I can't get out of. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>USAToday is reporting on a high school teacher in San Diego, who has started selling advertisements on his test papers in order to pay for printing costs for his class.  He felt it was the only way to subsidize the costs of printing for his classroom; his budget is $300, but his printing costs about $500 per school year.</p>

<p>Most ads, at this point, are pretty innocuous.  Inspirational messages from parents top the list of ads, but ads have also been bought by local engineering firms and an orthodontist.</p>

<p>What concerns me about this is that this marketing gives advertisers access to children.  Our children are the most vulnerable to advertising, without the maturity and life experience to weed out the obnoxiousness that is advertising.  I can block advertising when my kids surf (ad blocker plus for Firefox) and keep the television watching to a minimum, but if my kids are getting advertising at school on their tests and homework papers, I have absolutely no control over that.  While I would trust that the teacher would not allow questionable advertising to be printed on his test papers, when it comes to the almighty dollar, often greed trumps good sense.</p>

<p>I can appreciate the teacher's ingenuity, but I think there is probably a better way.  If he only needs to make $200, couldn't he have had a small class fundraiser that targeted the parents, who should be supporting their kids' education anyway?  I have to think this teacher went too far.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday after seeing ads injected into my video stream I asked the question in the Ustream.TV forum if there was a way to shut the ads off. The reply was no. The moderator then closed the message topic from further comment.</p>
<p>Seeing he closed the message topic I posted a second message that outlined my concerns and hoped to get a constructive conversation going. Well they not only closed that discussion before anyone could respond they actually deleted the comment in order to stifle debate. This was a second slap in the face.</p>
<p>The question that needs to be asked does Ustream.TV want to have a conversation with it&rsquo;s family of content contributors on their own site or do they want to have the conversation here?</p>
<p>I find it very curious in over 2 hours of viewing shows that are featured on the main page of Ustream.TV that&nbsp;none of those shows has the advertising we saw yesterday popping up. But as you dig in deeper, and leave the front page the advertising is very apparent.</p>
<p>What it appears they are doing, is making the shows on the front page look inviting without the intrusive advertising, and then sticking advertising into the content producers streams that are not on the front page of the website. Good&nbsp;strategy if you do not want to scare off perspective new content producers.</p>
<p>I have received&nbsp;a Twitter from someone at Ustream saying they would like to do a call. I will talk with them but they need to understand that they need to start being a bit more transparent and be willing to take the heat of criticism in their own forums. More as this develops.</p>
<p>To be fair I found out that Mogulus has started doing the same type of ad injection as well. Which really disappoints me that neither of these two sites informed their content producers or have given us a pro-offering that we could pay to play without advertising.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Revised: </p>
<p>I am leaving Usream.TV as soon as possible. Large in part due to what happened&nbsp;during a live sponsored event on ustream when they started without warning pushing large advertisements into the content stream. </p>
<p>I did not opt into having ads jammed into my viewers face. It was ridiculous. The ads where completely inappropriate for our audience.</p>
<p>I would have gladly payed for a premium service to not have ads forced n my viewers.&nbsp;But now that they have done this without warning I am finished with them they have burned a bridge here. </p>
<p>This could not come at a worse time as I was planning on holding the&nbsp;Podcast Awards ceremony on their service. I will be looking at alternatives today and tomorrow. Mogulus is one possibility but their encoding is not as good as Ustream.</p>
<p>The way they initiated this is wrong. No warning nothing. I understand a company has to make money just give us a heads up that this is going to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sad to think that they would not consider asking people to pay for premium accounts before doing this.</p>
<p>Not only that but the moderator over on their forums closed the discussion when I asked to how to turn&nbsp;advertising off, apparently they are getting some heat over this. </p>
<p>I have been chatting with some of their biggest streamed shows and they are pulling the plug on them as well. </p>
<p>Update: It should be noted that I am not against a company making money after all they have to keep the lights on. What I do take issue with is that the ads that are being pushed into the streaming content multiple times over the course of a hour and taking up nearly 1/2 of the screen real estate. The ads popped up so many times in that the viewers where annoyed. When the viewers get annoyed they leave.</p> <p>When Blip.TV came out with a pro service I gladly payed the $100.00 a year for faster encoding and the ability to have my own branded player without a watermark. They got paid and I got some cool new features. I am sure Ustream.TV is having trouble determining what is a fair value to charge for a pro-service but for many of us our viewer experience if important enough to pay for. If I were a betting man I bet the ads in those overlays do not pay that much. I bet what i would be willing to pay is more than they would ever make in this type of advertising.</p>]]>
