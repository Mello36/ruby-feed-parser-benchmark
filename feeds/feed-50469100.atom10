			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been reports all over the news of gun shops being extra busy with people coming in buying guns before the election because they are afraid Obama will get elected, and clamp down on gun control. I personally watched 2 people come in to the gun store I went to on Saturday (11/1/08) and buy guns stating Obama was the reason they were buying at the time.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this, and have decided this is a good thing. If Obama gets elected, he wants to bring our troops home. He will yank all of our troops from Iraq, and who knows about Afghanistan.  Which means all the bad guys will then start bringing their war to our home since no one is out there keeping them busy elsewhere.</p>
<p>So all these guns being bought up is good, since this means we will have more guns out there to protect our homes and family when the terrorists bring the attack to US soil!!!!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doctors</strong></p>
<p><strong>(A) </strong>The number of physicians in the U.S. is 700,000.</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> Accidental deaths caused by Physicians per year are 120,000.</p>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> Accidental deaths per physician is 0.171.</p>
<p>Statistics courtesy of U.S. Dept of Health Human Services.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Now think about this:</p>
<p><strong>Guns</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-92"></span></p>
<p><strong>(A)</strong> The number of gun owners in the U.S.  is 80,000,000. (Yes, that&#8217;s 80  million)</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> The number of accidental gun deaths per year, all age groups, is 1,500.</p>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> The number of accidental deaths per gun owner is .0000188.</p>
<p>Statistics courtesy of FBI</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>So, statistically, <em>doctors are approximately 9,000  times more dangerous than gun owner</em>s.</p>
<p>Remember, &#8216;<em><strong>Guns don&#8217;t kill people, doctors do</strong></em>.&#8217;</p>
<p>FACT:   <em>NOT EVERYONE HAS A GUN, BUT ALMOST  EVERYONE HAS AT LEAST ONE DOCTO</em>R.</p>
<p>Please alert your friends to this alarming threat.</p>
<p>We must ban doctors before this gets completely out of hand!!!!!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Out of concern for the public at large, I withheld the  statistics on lawyers for fear the shock would cause people to panic and seek medical attention!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This would be my platform:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> &#8216;Press 1 for English&#8217; is immediately banned. English is the official language; speak it or wait at the border until you can.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> We will immediately go into a two year isolationist posture to  straighten out the country&#8217;s attitude. NO imports, no exports.  We will use the &#8216;Wal-Mart&#8217;s policy, &#8216;If we ain&#8217;t got it, you don&#8217;t need it.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> When imports are allowed, there will be a 100% import tax on it.<br />
<span id="more-90"></span><br />
<strong>(4)</strong> All retired military personnel will be required to man one of our many observation towers on the southern border. (six month tour) They will be under strict orders not to fire on SOUTHBOUND aliens.</p>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> Social security will immediately return to its original state.  If you didn&#8217;t put nuttin in, you ain&#8217;t gettin nuttin out. The president nor any other politician will not be able to touch it.</p>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> Welfare - Checks will be handed out on Fridays at the end of the 40 hour school week and the successful completion of urinalysis and a passing grade.</p>
<p><strong>(7)</strong> Professional Athletes &#8211;Steroids - The FIRST time you check positive you&#8217;re banned for life.</p>
<p><strong>(8)</strong> Crime - We will adopt the Turkish method, the first time you steal, you lose your right hand. There is no more life sentences.  If convicted, you will be put to death by the same method you chose for your victim; gun, knife, strangulation, etc.</p>
<p><strong>(9)</strong> One export will be allowed; Wheat, The world needs to eat. A bushel of wheat will be the exact price of a barrel of oil.</p>
<p><strong>(10)</strong> All foreign aid using American taxpayer money will immediately cease, and the saved money will pay off the national debt and ultimately lower taxes. When disasters occur around the world, we&#8217;ll ask the American people if they want to donate to a disaster fund, and each citizen can make the decision whether it&#8217;s a worthy cause.</p>
<p><strong>(11)</strong> The Pledge of Allegiance will be said every day at school and every day in Congress.</p>
<p><strong>(12)</strong> The National Anthem will be played at all appropriate ceremonies, sporting events, outings, etc.</p>
<p>Sorry if I stepped on anyone&#8217;s toes but a vote for me will get you better than what you have, and better than what you&#8217;re gonna get.  Thanks for listening, and remember to write in my name on the ballot in November.</p>
<p><strong>God Bless America !!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I Am the Liberal-Progressives Worst Nightmare. I am an American.</p>
<p>I believe in God.</p>
<p>I ride Harleys Davidson Motorcycles and believe in American products.</p>
<p>I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some Liberal governmental functionary be it Democratic or Republican!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in touch with my feelings and I like it that way!</p>
<p>I think owning a gun doesn&#8217;t make you a killer, it makes you a smart American.<br />
<span id="more-85"></span><br />
I think being a minority does not make you noble or victimized, and does not entitle you to anything. Get over it!</p>
<p>I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac, do it in English.</p>
<p>I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God when and where they want to.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hate the rich. I don&#8217;t pity the poor.</p>
<p>I know wrestling is fake and I don&#8217;t waste my time watching or arguing about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never owned a slave, or was a slave, I haven&#8217;t burned any witches or been persecuted by the Turks and neither have you! So, shut up already.</p>
<p>I believe if you don&#8217;t like the way things are here, go back to where you came from and change your own country! This is AMERICA &#8230; We like it the way it is!</p>
<p>If you were born here and don&#8217;t like it you are free to move to any Socialist country that will have you.</p>
<p>I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson preaches, where he gets his money, and why he is always part of the problem and not the solution. Can I get an AMEN on that one?</p>
<p>I also think the cops have the right to pull you over if you&#8217;re breaking the law, regardless of what color you are.</p>
<p>And, no, I don&#8217;t mind having my face shown on my drivers license.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s good&#8230;.. And I&#8217;m proud that &#8216;God&#8217; is written on my money.</p>
<p>I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I don&#8217;t want you deciding who should be running the most powerful nation in the world for the next four years.</p>
<p>I believe the president of the United States should put his hand over his heart and say the pledge of alegance and should have no reservations about wearing American flag pins on his lapel.</p>
<p>I dislike those people standing in the intersections trying to sell me stuff or trying to guilt me into making &#8216;donations&#8217; to their cause. Get a Job and do your part!</p>
<p>I believe that it doesn&#8217;t take a village to raise a child, it takes two parents.</p>
<p>I believe &#8216;illegal&#8217; is illegal no matter what the lawyers think.</p>
<p>I believe the American flag should be the only one allowed in AMERICA !</p>
<p>If this makes me a BAD American, then yes, I&#8217;m a BAD American.</p>
<p><strong>WE LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE FREE, ONLY BECAUSE OF THE BRAVE !</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you can read this whole story without laughing, then there&#8217;s no hope for you. This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in Texas.</p>
<p>Note: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better. For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City Park.</p>
<p><strong>Judge #3</strong> was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL. Frank: &#8220;Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge&#8217;s table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn&#8217;t be all that spic y; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the scorecard notes from the event:<br />
<span id="more-81"></span><br />
<em><strong>CHILI # 1 - MIKE&#8217;S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI.</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> (Frank) &#8212; Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that&#8217;s the worst one. These Texans are crazy.</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN&#8217;S AFTERBURNER CHILI.</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> &#8212; Keep this out of the reach of children. I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 3 - FRED&#8217;S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI.</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; A bit salty, good use of peppers.<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> &#8212; Call the EPA. I&#8217;ve located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I&#8217;m getting sh**-faced from all of the beer.</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 4 - BUBBA&#8217;S BLACK MAGIC&#8230;</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> &#8212; I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT&#8230; just like this nuclear waste I&#8217;m eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 5 LISA&#8217;S LEGAL LIP REMOVER&#8230;</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> &#8212; My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I&#8217;m burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming.</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 6 - VERA&#8217;S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY&#8230;</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> &#8212; My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I messed on myself when I farted, and I&#8217;m worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except for Sally. Can&#8217;t feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my rear with a snow cone.</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 7 - SUSAN&#8217;S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI&#8230;</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about 	     <strong>Judge #3</strong>. He appears to be a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> &#8212; You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn&#8217;t feel a thing. I&#8217;ve lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they&#8217;ll know what killed me. I&#8217;ve decided to stop breathing, it&#8217;s too painful. Screw it; I&#8217;m not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I&#8217;ll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.</p>
<p><em><strong>CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM&#8217;S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI&#8230;..</strong></em><br />
<strong>Judge #1</strong> &#8212; The perfect ending, this is a nice blend of chili&#8217;s. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.<br />
<strong>Judge #2</strong> &#8212; This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when <strong>Judge #3</strong> farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he&#8217;s going to make it, poor feller, wonder how he&#8217;d have reacted to really hot chili?<br />
<strong>Judge #3</strong> - No Report</p>

<p><span id="watch-view-count"><a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/31/joe-vet-endorses-mccain-youtubes-popular-election-video/" target="_blank">In his interview with Fox News</a>, Joe Cook told FOX News&#8217; Shepard Smith that Obama&#8217;s calling the war in Iraq a mistake is &#8220;a slap in the face&#8221; in an interview Friday. &#8220;A lot of people forget that Saddam Hussein broke a lot of international treaties before we even went to attack. Bush gave him a lot of opportunities to fix what he was doing and he didn&#8217;t, so going in was not a mistake. We got rid of a dictatorship that was torturing its people. You can&#8217;t have that happen,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>Watch it to the end, and see what you think!</p>

I went to bootcamp in San Diego, CA in 1979. From there I went to the Seabee base in Gulfport MS for &#8220;Steelworker A School&#8221;. My 1st duty station was public works, Atsugi Naval Air Station, Atsugi Japan, where I spent 3 years. I left Atsugi going to Naval Mobil Construction Battalion (NMCB) 5 which I joined in homeport in Port Hueneme CA. My first deployment was a detachment to Iwakuni Marine Corp Air Station, Iwakuni Japan. From there we went  back to homeport where I got out of the Navy in 1984. <span id="more-58"></span>I went back in the Navy in Feb 1986. my 1st duty station was to Construction Battallion Unit (CBU) 421 where I was a plank owner. I transfered to <a href="https://www.seabee.navy.mil/index.cfm/33490" target="_blank">NMCB 40</a> in 1988. My 1st deployment was to <a href="http://www.sicily.navy.mil/" target="_blank">U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily</a>. After the following home port, we deployed to Camp Covington, Guam, where the 2nd day we were there, we were told pack our trash, we heading to Saudi in support of the Gulf War. We returned to Port Huemene after the ground war was over. I was sent over to Naval Construction Training Center, Port Huemene for the next deployment, where I taught classes. After the battalion returned to homeport, I returned to the battalion, then was discharged in May, 1992</p>
<p>I had a lot of good times while in the bee&#8217;s. And I miss it sometimes. Sometimes I regret getting out with 11 years active duty, but I tell myself if I hadn&#8217;t got out when I did, I wouldn&#8217;t have met my wife, and I wouldn&#8217;t have my son.</p>
