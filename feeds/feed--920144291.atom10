		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/12/10/thain-request-for-bonus-from-board-shows-a-lack-of-ceo-decision-making/"><![CDATA[<p>I was amazed at the fast but high profile attention paid to the matter of John Thain and his request for a $10 million bonus from Merrill Lynch.&#160; Yet another example of someone so smart, can be so blind not just to the importance of public opinion, but how it reflects on his business judgment.</p>
<p>While Thaine may well be correct in thinking that his decision making may have saved the bank, he is missing the larger picture…and maybe, for once, the board, which denied the request, is not.&#160; Thaine is obviously not recognizing the reality that 1) any bonus request is seen as being tantamount to corporate fraud; 2) the leadership role of the CEO is to set a public example and show sensitivity to the economic situation; and 3) the management role is to save as many jobs as possible (laying off people while requesting a bonus does not seem to be consistent with that goal.&#160; So while Thaine certainly deserves a pat on the back for realizing Merrill needed to be sold, he seems to have fallen short in other critical decision making areas.&#160; And one must wonder that if a CEO that can’t see where the world is today, should they be CEO in 2009?</p>

<p>We’re in the market to lease a new mini-van.&#160; After request a quote for the basic model and getting what was supposedlyy a very decent price (compared to two months ago), I did some quick math to find we were still paying a above the amount that Toyota advertises as the starting price on their web site (see picture).</p>
<p>I was then informed by the sales person that the basic model with that starting price on the Web site is without any options, and that kind of car isn’t available – they all arrive with some options already installed that drive the basic price for cars actually available up a few thousand.</p>
<p>In other words, Toyota is advertising a very enticing product and price combination…but they are not actually making it available.&#160; Classic bait and switch.</p>
<p>Does every manufacturer do this?&#160; No.&#160; I did buy a car a few years ago where we wanted the absolute basic model…though the dealer did have to go out of state to get it for us.&#160; But it’s not uncommon either.&#160; And for an industry where so much of the purchase decision is based on buyers trusting the brand, it’s an odd way to use one of the most valuable marketing assets.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/11/06/how-to-use-the-language-of-business-for-more-effect-c-level-counsel/"><![CDATA[<p>I just published an article for the PRSA’s PR Strategist magazine (no link yet) on rules to follow for C-level PR counsel and programming.&#160; A central part of my recommended approach is making sure your are talking the language of business.&#160; This comes in two parts.&#160; First, are you using effective business language and not PR language.&#160; Second, are you using the company’s business language.</p>
<p>Last week’s BusinessWeek had a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/08_44/b4106106197381.htm" target="_blank">column by Frank Lunch on what terms executives should use when communicating.</a>&#160; I think the same column should be read by PR executives to understand what language works with executives.&#160; A few choice quotes from the article lay out some good general rules for effective language</p>
<blockquote><p>Focusing on &quot;impact&quot; also makes a listener pay attention. This one word causes people to assume they will see a measurable difference. </p>
<p>Another word with increasing resonance is &quot;reliability.&quot; Reliability is now even more important among customers than price. </p>
<p>The last two words to make a part of your business vocabulary are &quot;mission&quot; and &quot;commitment.&quot; …Commitment means a speaker is willing to put his or her credibility on the line to achieve a successful outcome.</p>
<p>Mission, meanwhile, should not be confused with &quot;mission statements,&quot;…a mission explains in more compassionate terminology what you do, why you do it, and above all, why you care. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond this, PR counsel needs to be communicated in technical business terms as opposed to PR terms.&#160; For example, instead of <em>reputation impact </em>it might be about <em>impacting audience opinion. </em>&#160; </p>
<p>Second, and of particular importance to agencies, is the need to understand a particular company’s culture and language.&#160; A creative company may communicate using qualitative language while a financial firm may be more interested in hearing quantitative language.</p>
<p>I’ll post the full article from the PR Strategist shortly.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/11/03/jack-welch-on-media-relations-and-crisis-management/"><![CDATA[<p>Jack and Suzy Welch’s column in BusinesssWeek this week (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_45/b4107096313309.htm?chan=magazine+channel_opinion" target="_blank">read it here</a>) focused on media relations in a crisis situation.&#160;&#160;&#160; While chairman and CEO of GE, Mr. Welch had to deal with more than a few issues in the public eye.&#160; Any experienced corporate communications practitioner has dealt with CEOs in a tough media situation, but where the CEOs’ inclination is to try and manage the media instead of managing the situation.&#160; This column may be an important arrow in the quiver next time you need to convince a C-level executive that trying to manage the media is a losing proposition.&#160; Here are a few choice quotes and paraphrases (in italics) and my notes from the column:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. [Businesses] think they can tell portions of their story, leaving out the personal, messy, or confusing parts, and still have the media (and the public) consider their comments &quot;truthful.&quot; The problem is, whatever you leave out of your story will be filled in—if not with facts, then with conjecture, rumor, or opinion. Is that unfair? It doesn&#8217;t matter. The media&#8217;s job is to tell a complete story. Your job, if you&#8217;re in the public eye, is to protect yourself by helping them get it, warts and all, with your perspective attached every step of the way.</p>
<p>2. Have you transmitted the same message to everyone? If there is one mistake that practically guarantees negative publicity, it&#8217;s adjusting your point of view for different audiences. Barack Obama, for instance, took a barrage of criticism when, after praising the values of religious worship and gun ownership at Midwestern rallies, he derided the same at a private fund-raising party in San Francisco.</p>
<p>3. Finally, have you taken your media coverage into your own hands? Time was, the media had the last word. The Web made it so there are no more last words. Sure, it can be used against you in a media firestorm, what with thousands of amateur news sites and blogs. But that&#8217;s all the more reason to use the Web for your own defense, if not offense. Celebrities now speak directly to the public about rumors; companies are doing the same. Individuals who feel maligned now have this option. You may not be able to change the course of your media coverage to your complete liking, but at least you&#8217;ll have an active role in it—in your own words.</p>
</blockquote>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/10/19/powell-endorses-obama-and-acts-like-the-only-adult-in-the-room/"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished watching Colin Powell’s endorsement of Obama and what struck me, and possibly many others, was not the endorsement itself, but that he came across as an adult interested not in party, politics or even a specific candidate, but in country and in making a practical decision, not a biased one.&#160; Perhaps, even in the final few weeks, the candidates can take a few lessons. </p>
<ol>
<li>Directly addresses key areas using common sense language. Case in point: Stating that taxes are , in fact, a redistribution of wealth but a necessary one making the point that who else will pay for our roads, military and other necessary public investments (yes, there are a million programs we can argue over but that’s separate from the core principle. </li>
<li>Did a better job of highlighting McCain’s negative campaign than Obama did by simply reminding everyone that McCain’s campaign announced they were going negative during the economic crisis.&#160; </li>
<li>He sounds like an adult and make others sound childish.&#160; Making accusations always brings the maturity level down a notch.&#160; </li>
<li>Like the good man he is, he reminds everyone that this is about country first.&#160; Being a Republican (until yesterday), a well regarded military man and a diplomatic that correctly forecasted Iraq, he has respect that most can’t ignore.&#160; Unlike the candidates, it’s easier to believe as he does not back up this position with accusation or party platform policy positions. </li>
</ol>
<p>Quite a few months ago I wrote that McCain’s hiring of Steve Schmidt would lead to a negative campaign that would turn off voters.&#160; I took a lot of flack for that (especially as I usually hold the position that negative campaigning works).&#160; But in these tough times, people, seem to be trying harder to focus on the issues and ignore the accusations.&#160;&#160; By avoiding missteps that create a negative, immature energy and focusing on practical decision making, someone like Powell just reinforces what is really important, and what is campaign noise that should be ignored.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/10/10/where-are-the-responsible-politicians-in-this-economic-crisis/"><![CDATA[<p>As we enter a time where a 200 point drop in the stock market is a mild day and a rescue a week is considered minimal action, the leadership vacuum is growing daily.&#160; True, leaders are out there every day trying to calm the markets and outline plans, but their words seem to have little effect.&#160; Their leadership is, as of this morning, failing.&#160;&#160; So what’s missing?&#160; A sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, there will be that political crisis management philosophy that says deny, point and blame and the legal approach that says “never admit wrongdoing.”&#160; But this is about true leadership and faith in government.&#160;&#160; Everyone assumes the government played a critical role in letting the markets get to this point.&#160; So if politicians are not, on behalf of the government, willing to take responsibility, how are we to have faith in their ability to be responsible for leading the fix to this problem.</p>
<p>We teach our children to take responsibility for their actions as, by doing so, people are more likely to trust them to do the right thing the next time around.&#160; If our leaders don’t event have a grade-school level sense of responsibility, how are we to trust them with a global-level economic solution?</p>

<p>When Campbell Brown of CNN asked McCain spokesperson Tucker Bounds about Palin&#8217;s experience, Mr. Bounds did what he was trained to do - he answered the question he wanted to answer and not the question asked.&nbsp; But instead of doing what political media often (sadly) do and moving on to the next question, Ms. Brown pressed Mr. Tucker to answer the question he was asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucker was woefully unprepared and looked like he was avoiding the question (Watch the video and judge for yourself - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxMCp1vydEI" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxMCp1vydEI</a>).</p>
<p>Now, the McCain campaign has canceled a Larry King interview supposedly as punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is risking a reputation for looking like they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t answer the tough questions which opens up another &#8220;just like Bush&#8221; line of attack.</p>
<p>The problem was that Mr. Tucker, like most people in politics, was only trained to answer the question he wanted to answer.&nbsp; While this is a well established and practiced media relations practice, it shows an incomplete media relations training.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucker was obviously not trained on what to do if a journalist presses on a tough question.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We work most often with business and trade media.&nbsp; While we do train our clients to get their message out by redirecting to answers they want to give, we also train and prepare them to make sure they answer the question asked in the most direct way possible.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not simply to avoid a Tucker Bounds situation but to show transparency and create goodwill both with the audience and the journalist.&nbsp; Whether it is a politician or business executive and regardless of whether a journalist pushes or not, people see when the person being interviewed is avoiding the question.&nbsp;&nbsp; For audiences, avoiding the question reinforces the lack of transparency and truthfulness in politics.&nbsp; Just imaging if a CEO avoided answering a question on explaining why the company missed earnings and simply talked about their vision?&nbsp; One word - skewered.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Beyond the PR lessons, my main hope for this political season is that, regardless of who wins, more journalists take note of Campbell Brown and realize that when they ask a question they should get an answer to that question.&nbsp; And when they don&#8217;t, it should be noted publicly.&nbsp; If this was standard practice, we would start seeing the transparency and truthfulness from politicians we all seek.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/09/03/what-is-a-search-engine-reputation-with-examples-from-obama-mccain-campaigns/"><![CDATA[<p>Pick a topic, any topic, that you don&#8217;t know that well and type in some keywords online.&nbsp; Those initial results and their ranking are you first impression.&nbsp; Now, type in your company or product name along with associated keywords and see what comes up.&nbsp; That&#8217;s your audiences first search impression.&nbsp; These days, it may be there first impression overall.</p>
<p>Protecting and enhancing your <em>search reputation</em> is still an often overlooked component of reputation management, as the Obama campaign found out.&nbsp; Using a marketing tactic known as ambush ads, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121988099541678063.html?mod=dist_smartbrief" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s recent article</a> on the McCain online strategy outlined how McCain is using Obama related keywords (such as Biden) to direct viewers to McCain controlled content.&nbsp; The result? For many people looking for more information on Biden and Obama, the first impression will be one formed by the McCain campaign.</p>
<p>Search continues to be dominated by marketing and sales by <em>search reputation </em>is an area that should be considered as basic as media relations, if not more so.&nbsp; The problem lies not in PR teams realizing the importance of search, but in the understanding of how to manage a brand&#8217;s search reputation.&nbsp; To do that, several basic skill sets and steps must be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>An understanding of your audience and their use of search.&nbsp; Like any other medium, the importance of search reputation management will be more less important depending on your audience.&nbsp; For example, a young professional audience may likely use Google for a first stop for information while a high end business audience may use a high end research service such as Factiva for corporate information.&nbsp; Understand how and why your audience is using search.  </li>
<li>Analysis and ongoing tracking of user search habits so that the PR team understands what people are looking for when they happen to or should come across positive and accurate information on your brand.  </li>
<li>An understanding of organic and paid search engine optimization.&nbsp; This means learning how to manage Web page optimization and paid search results so that the first search impression of you brand is the right one.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just three basic rules to follow.&nbsp; The reality is more complicated and difficult as it requires PR teams to be as well versed in search as they (hopefully) are in media relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an industry, we&#8217;re still at an early stage.&nbsp; How many PR job descriptions have you seen with search engine optimization skills as part of the requirement?</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.fortexgroup.com/blog/2008/08/27/advertising-creative-directors-on-ideas-for-the-presidential-campaigns/"><![CDATA[<p>I found this <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/special-reports/other-reports/e3iea21f1e730544128f8719de4ac9847f7" target="_blank">Ad Week report</a> on how different agency creative directors would spin presidential campaigns an interesting reminder on different views of the same message.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to critique each ad, you should do that, but they are worth looking at to see interesting alternative ideas for how candidates can communicate their message.&nbsp; Of course, some also highlight why the ad agency approach is not the best choice to lead in political campaigns which are zero sum&nbsp; (e.g., do we really want the world voting as one proposes? It would raise awareness but being the global winner can easily backfire domestically).  </p>
<p>Reading this did remind me that companies should also be looking for new ways to communicate their brand messages.&nbsp; This does not mean constantly firing agencies (a common mistake), but having alternative sources of creative and strategic inspiration that the agency(ies) can then put into action.</p>
