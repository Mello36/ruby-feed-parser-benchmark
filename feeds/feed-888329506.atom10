They absolutely did. Viral, clean, elegant and great results. Like any great software institution, feature clutter, the continuous ebb and flow of fickle user interest, and people getting fat and happy off of their options gets the better of most of Silicon Valley's break aways over time. And Wall Street oh Wall Street, "do I no longer please you?" It happens to everyone, GOOG. What would financial markets be without new &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;starlets&lt;/span&gt; all the time. Irrational exuberance and rational pragmatism - two cousins that hate each other, but absolutely can't live without one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;Will Google be a big part of the web experience for some time? Sure they will. Will they be the gravitational center? Unlikely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;Take a look at this quick comparison of page views.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171868351809415666" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Q8wIMHzryF4/R8Yq3T6vafI/AAAAAAAABoQ/tZQAH-qyA7A/s400/Traffic+Comparison+-+Google.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;font-size:130%;"&gt;While there are hundreds of ways to poke at this, I am going to just keep it simple. Look at what has happened to &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;Baidu&lt;/span&gt; and look at the other three. Clearly the concept of where and how you find content is changing. Search is adding context - friends, dating, maps, encyclopedia topics, video and a whole &lt;em&gt;Yelp&lt;/em&gt; more. Google can certainly try to keep on top of all these trends, but it is a losing battle. No &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; company is going to own all or even most of the web search behavior of human beings because search as it turns out is actually just an attribute of other behaviors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:130%;"&gt;Google is a learning organization, however. They saw this coming years ago. Their strategy of offering advertisers a bundle of possible advertising methods is a winner and the next real battle front in web advertising. Microsoft clearly sees this. Anybody else? &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;Baidu&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;/*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;![CDATA[*/     // USER-EDITABLE VARIABLES    // enter up to 3 domains, separated by a space    var sites      = ['google.com facebook.com live.com'];     var opts = {       width:      380,  // width in pixels (max 400)       height:     300,  // height in pixels (max 300)       type:       'r',  // "r" Reach, "n" Rank, "p" Page Views        range:      '6m', // "7d", "1m", "3m", "6m", "1y", "3y", "5y", "max"        bgcolor:    'e6f3fc' // hex value without "#" char (usually "e6f3fc")    };    // END USER-EDITABLE VARIABLES     AGraphManager.add( new AGraph(sites, opts) );   //]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://knownewmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/02/bye-baidu-google.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ken Pulverman)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_Q8wIMHzryF4/R8Yq3T6vafI/AAAAAAAABoQ/tZQAH-qyA7A/s72-c/Traffic+Comparison+-+Google.bmp' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2259289577933789158.post-7817045416743852330</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2008 04:31:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-02-12T20:33:23.536-08:00</atom:updated><title>A Little Fun with Truth in Advertising</title><description>Just for fun....here's a few great examples of just how far Photoshop can stretch the truth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bspcn.com/2008/02/12/top-40-photoshopped-images/"&gt;http://www.bspcn.com/2008/02/12/top-40-photoshopped-images/&lt;/a&gt;</description><link>http://knownewmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/02/little-fun-with-truth-in-advertising.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ken Pulverman)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2259289577933789158.post-2330556143481832289</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2008 01:59:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-02-12T20:34:09.240-08:00</atom:updated><title>Espousing Pithiness</title><description>So you ask, what have you been doing? You haven’t written a blog entry in a long time? Well while living the dream of thinking big Marketing 2.0 thoughts and driving the corresponding actions, I started to question the value of a blog. Oh yes, it’s there, but I think the format of mine and others needs to change. We are all super time starved, and I think lengthy musings just don’t do it for folks. However, at the same time I was questioning the nature of business blogging, my small readership was coming out of the woodwork to question why I hadn’t written in a while. My most current opinion is that I need to keep it short for my sanity and yours. With that said, I am going to completely violate that today as I am going to show you right here a couple of the things I’ve been up to since the last post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I’ve been working on a website that will be a companion piece to this blog (indeed the blog is embedded in it) to capture resource links and threads to the points we discuss here. In the next week or so, I’ll be transferring a lot of the Marketing 2.0 resources I assembled for an internal corporate audience to this public space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what it looks like (built with the new beta release of Netvibes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5166283056078612914" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Q8wIMHzryF4/R7JTET6vabI/AAAAAAAABl4/3dr-AJqWrnc/s400/pulvermandotcom.JPG" border="0" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This next item is impossible to read and Blogger's upload converted me to a member of the Blue Man Group. So dear reader(s), if you are up on the latest file posting techniques for blogs, let me know. Google Docs wanted this in HTML and it looked pretty bad though not as bad as what you see below. It’s a paper a wrote that will appear in a publication called Perform that is published by the same folks that run the magazine, Revenue Today. Anyway – some thoughts on why I believe web 2.0 is actually supporting very old behaviors for how we buy and sell not new ones. If you are interested, e-mail me, and I’ll send you a copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All for this addition. Shorter and pithier next time. Promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5166286526412188130" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Q8wIMHzryF4/R7JWOT6vaeI/AAAAAAAABmQ/LopkNHED1fA/s400/The+Rise+of+Social+Sales+%26+Marketing+-+K+Pulverman_Page_1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5166280990199343506" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Q8wIMHzryF4/R7JRMD6vaZI/AAAAAAAABlo/DZ0LumnXv7M/s400/The+Rise+of+Social+Sales+%26+Marketing+-+K+Pulverman_Page_2.jpg" border="0" /&gt;</description><link>http://knownewmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/02/so-you-ask-what-have-you-been-doing-you.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ken Pulverman)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_Q8wIMHzryF4/R7JTET6vabI/AAAAAAAABl4/3dr-AJqWrnc/s72-c/pulvermandotcom.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2259289577933789158.post-6696583831963961388</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2007 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-09-28T17:24:02.341-07:00</atom:updated><title>The Battle for Relevance Rages On</title><description>I’m following up my opening rant with some news from the front. There were two very interesting developments in the battle for your attention this week that play exactly in to what I waxed on about last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the &lt;em&gt;offensive&lt;/em&gt; move. &lt;a href="http://www.thepudding.com/"&gt;ThePudding.com&lt;/a&gt; made some fanfare in the news this week. Their new solution offers people the opportunity to make calls over the Internet for free if you don’t mind big brother listening in and attempting to serve you relevant ads at the same time. Early reviews are that the creep factor is more funny than creepy as a computer tries to pick out key words of wisdom from your blather and serve up ads that pertain to what you are wrapping about. I’ve signed up for the beta, so as soon as they let me in, I’ll be able to tell you more from a first hand perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting thing about ThePudding, is not what they are, but what they might be. They don’t plan to be a consumer-facing site in the medium term, but rather an offering for companies that provide voIP/ Internet telephony solutions. Free calls may soon be coming to Skype, Yahoo and others via a Pudding back end that enables these companies to make enough from advertising to more than cover the costs of Ma Bell’s connection charges and the thickened chocolate milk that makes it all possible. So are you willing to let a computer eavesdrop if its owner promises not to store anything you’ve said? These guys are hoping ThePudding is sweet enough to convince you to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the &lt;em&gt;defensive&lt;/em&gt; move. If you tuned into NPR’s &lt;em&gt;On the Media&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday, you were treated to a great story on &lt;a href="http://www.adblockplus.org/"&gt;Ad Block Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a plug in for Firefox that blocks almost all the ads you see while surfing the Internet. This one I did get to try. It works so well it is scary. Why scary? You can just imagine an advertising World War III where advertisers come up with ever more ingenious ways to serve us ads while an underground resistance figures out ways to block every new approach. The problem I foresee is that we are going to be the innocent civilians caught in the middle of this crossfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ad Block Plus works by keeping a list of all of the sites that serve ads to websites and blocks those feeds, much like a virus list. Virus is an apt analogy for at least 3/4ths of the stuff I see. The folk at Internet hegemon, Google, must be seriously pissed. You buy DoubleClick for a king’s ransom as part of your attempt to sew up the entire digital marketing landscape and some joker with a .org figures out a way to block your ad feed. Sure, you can sue him to the center of the earth, but the cat is now out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;On the Media&lt;/em&gt; show, The NPR crew broached the topic of whether or not blocking ads was a form of stealing. The logic went that it costs real money to serve up these sites. If you block off their revenue source, you are essentially taking something for free – their offering – be it news, maps, reviews, or e-mail. On the surface, I agree that we do have a real problem if we bite the Internet hands that feed us. On the other hand, I’ve had to look at the same horribly annoying flashing low interest rate banner above my Yahoo e-mail inbox for the better part of a year. Yahoo must be so proud of themselves knowing that I have a mortgage. Now if they just knew when it was time for me to refinance or how unlikely I was to click on a chartreuse banner that looks like it was designed by some ex-used car salesmen. Part of me says it serves them right. Violate our trust long enough and if we are given a way to opt out, we do. Just ask the churn department at your wireless carrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular battle will be fascinating to watch. I predict détente will come in the form of permission-based marketing on sites we frequent fueled by a whole series of new companies that get much much better at behavioral targeting. Truly relevant ads? What a novel idea. It’s so novel, it’s novious.</description><link>http://knownewmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/09/battle-for-relevance-rages-on.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ken Pulverman)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2259289577933789158.post-5196246905816513286</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2007 17:52:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-09-21T16:48:01.338-07:00</atom:updated><title>Know New Marketing - What in the H are you talking about?</title><description>&lt;span style="font-family:arial;"&gt;.....yes it's a play on words....I'm fond of those, and if we ever meet in person, or perhaps even in this blog, you'll have to endure some bad puns as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;"&gt;So what am I getting at? Well a growing number of us believe that marketing, as we currently know it, is dead. As consumers we are tired of the window dressing, snake oil, and spin. Tell us what is is, what is does, and why I should care. ...and make it quick, because I have an inbox full of spam like you wouldn't believe, or maybe you would.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;Why did it die? Simple. Trust. What was that our scholar of a president tried to reiterate - &lt;em&gt;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice&lt;/em&gt;...and that is where he lost it, but you know what comes next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;Collectively we are sick of the junk mail, the valueless &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;untargeted&lt;/span&gt; commercials, the mailbox full of crap. In our limited time on this rock, we search for meaning and purpose and there are a whole bunch of direct marketers who want to waste that precious time. We trusted you, and you burned us one too many times. Like many folks, I've moved to triage mode on the tons of messages trying to reach me. If I can figure out what it is with reasonable certainty it gets deleted or thrown out without ever being opened. I am currently looking for a shredder big enough to accept those 20 page credit card offers poorly masquerading as important courier envelopes, unopened of course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;So as you can imagine, it produces a fair bit of &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;cognitive&lt;/span&gt; dissonance for me to work as a marketer. Fortunately there are a &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;growing&lt;/span&gt; number of us hell bent on leveraging new marketing techniques to prove the substantial ROI of marketing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;With the democratization of all of the media channels, marketing today is about conversations. Broadcasts and monologues are so yesteryear. This blog will explore how to reach your customers, members, constituents post Marketing 1.0 through the conversations that matter to them (and guess what, its almost never going to happen on your website). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;"&gt;So buckle up, java down and join me in this dialogue where we will chart the course for where we go from here. The good news is that the only way is up.&lt;/span&gt;</description><link>http://knownewmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/09/know-new-marketing-what-in-h-are-you.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ken Pulverman)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
