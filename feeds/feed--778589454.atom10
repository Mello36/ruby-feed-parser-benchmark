			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Again and again, thanks to Chris Phillips,  here is a teaser to the third part of the <a href="http://www.hillingdonmind.org.uk/">hillingdonmind.org.uk</a> interview with John done in October. The third part of the interview is up on <a href="http://www.hillingdonmind.org.uk/johnfrusciante_part3.php">the following page</a>, <span class="warning">together with handwritten lyrics of Ah Yom</span>, the second bonus track which will be released on the Japanese version of <em>The Empyrean</em>. Tilt your heads, zoom as much as you can...and you will see one of the lines that was inscribed into the <em>Curtains</em> vinyl: <span class="important">A million ways things could be</span>.</p>
<p>Below the teaser, you will find an outtake from the interview given exclusively to Invisible Movement, directly continuing onto the third part of the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In your daily life, if you have a thought that's motivated through insecurity or fear, (or in a lot of cases garbage that your brain is manufacturing, that you find yourself caught up in)- it's the nature of our minds that once a thought arises, for that thought to become another and another, with our days going by with these trains of thought. These trains end up being interrupted by something circumstantial: You run into a person and start a new conversation and the thoughts go away for a second, or you sit in-front of a tv screen and that blocks the thoughts out. But, in your daily life you're usually consumed by these thoughts when there's no distractions. A lot of the time you're worried about whether this or that is gonna happen, or is this person mad at me, or am I not handsome enough, or am I not sexy enough or whatever it is. These kind of thoughts end up producing these really vast trains our brains are inescapable from, because the whole thing is being led by the emotions. The thoughts and emotions are tied to one another.</p>
<p>With meditation a lot of people have this misconception that the purpose is not to think anything, but to me the most valuable part of it is to establish a type of detachment from your thoughts, in which your emotions and thoughts are cut off from one another. The purpose when you're sitting down with a technique like Vipassana is to observe your thoughts and to not get involved in them. Let them move by like they're a cloud."</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-2413"></span></p>
<p>After discussing meditation with John, Chris Phillips asked if the title <em>Inside of Emptiness</em> had any relation to meditation, in the sense of emptiness being a positive thing. And the below was John's response.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I had never meditated yet at that time. I had read about it in Aleister Crowley books and I had friends that did it. I'm sure it does have a relationship to the meaning that you're talking about. In my lyrics and everything I was doing with words at that time, and pretty much since I started writing the lyrics of the stuff on my first solo album; I was really thinking in terms of trying to play games with words, to find words where the meanings had some sort of conflict with one another but that conflict found some sort of harmony in the context of lyrics or titles. It's that same reconciliation of differences that I was saying takes place with the numbers that music can be analysed by. It's the same thing with lyrics- you could have nothing but contradictory statements in the lyrics of the song and because they're in the musical context, because they have the poetic relationship to one another (the rhyming relationship and the metric relationship to one another), they seem to convey one idea even though they're two contradictory ideas. I was always trying to explore that and try to find things like that. And so the 'Inside of Emptiness' was an idea that sounded good in my brain because of its contradictory nature. It's not contradictory if you open yourself up to the idea even though to imagine the inside of emptiness is something that our brains can't really realise. That's why the words sound good to me- they sort of open up an idea in me. Trying to grasp the ungraspable. Thats what I was looking for in my lyrics. It's only been in the last 2 years that I've introduced a new challenge to myself within the lyric writing department beyond that, because I have other things I want to convey and had to do with reading a lot about those specific things, and so my lyrics are still doing the same thing and also doing something different, but I can't really talk about it."</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, a huge apology to everyone for this delay, and a note that normal site updates will resume on Wednesday or Thursday. My desktop computer is having some serious issues and is currently being repaired and I don't have half of the things for the update that was supposed to happen yesterday on this craptop. So, the 07th December update will come to you on 11th December or so.</p>
<p>Second of all...Invisible Movement's sister site, <a href="http://www.stonecoldbush.com">Stonecoldbush.com</a> is running a little Christmas raffle. They're giving away two mugs, so...if you're the fan-type of fan (sorry if this doesn't make much sense to you, because it does to me); <a href="http://www.stonecoldbush.com/component/option,com_lottery/Itemid,20/view,lottery/">head over there</a> and answer the question. Good luck! ^_^</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Invisible Movement turned four on 24th November (and curiously, the 1000th comment was also posted that day - congrats to Flo!), but there were more things to discuss that day and the day after, too. In web terms, running a website that's always up to date, with a frightening grow rate, constant hostility kicking in from all possible angles and all possible sides of the world...it all comes down to the fact that four years is like a century. Also, the site has had more than 70 000 unique visitors during November 2008, which is quite an achievement. Thank you all for being so wonderful.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, Feedburner is crazy. Perhaps it works perfectly on some servers, but it absolutely refuses to play well with this one. As it was not updating the feed, I considered switching to a self-hosted feed statistics tool and subscription tool, but looks like it works again. I apologise for this inconvinience. And a reminder: if you ever want to change the email address you're receiving notifications at, there's a link for that at the bottom of each single email with updates you receive! It's simple as pie.</p>
<p>Second of all, the links to individual updates' pages have been changed to something more human. But no worries, there's a redirection, so no URIs will be dead. </p>
<p>So...either way, thanks, and enjoy today's updates, by any means!</p>
<ol>
<li>An exciting experimental feature: a lifestream of feeds.</li>
<li>Lyrics to Unreachable (various transcriptions), Song To The Siren and Today</li>
<li>The rumour mill updated, a new placeholder page created.</li>
<li>A set of rare live photographs from 1997</li>
<li>Four sets of magazine scans - from 1989, 1999, 2001 and 2005</li>
<li>A 2001 solo show in mp3 and flac</li>
<li>The famous online audio FAQ from 2004</li>
<li>A magazine article from 2000</li>
<li>Some new wallpapers by Leni, David and Willy</li>
<li>A beautiful drawing by Katarzyna Jabłońska</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-2318"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Hive/Lifestream</strong><br />
In order to have everything that is relevant in one place, I have tried to compile news from all the related websites on one page. Click <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/the-hive">here</a> to view syndicated news from a couple of related websites. The tool just fetches headlines from RSS, so you will, of course, have to go to those websites to see what's new. Please, note that this feature is still experimental: e.g. I still cannot add custom text and/or an icon next to feeds' names but I reckon that this will be possible in near future. </p>
<p><strong>Lyrics updated</strong><br />
Thanks to a bunch of nice people, there are a couple of new transcripts of Unreachable at <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/discography/the-empyrean/unreachable">the song's page</a>. Also, the lyrics to <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/discography/the-empyrean/today">Today</a> and <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/discography/the-empyrean/song-to-the-siren">Song To The Siren</a> are available now as well. Enjoy them!</p>
<p>The other song pages for the new album have placeholders as well. But there's nothing on them, so don't bother figuring out their URIs.</p>
<p><strong>The Empyrean-related updates</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/discography/the-empyrean">A placeholder page for the album</a> has been created and, as the content becomes available, it will be updated.<br />
<a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/discography/the-empyrean-rumour-mill">The rumour mill</a> has been redone once again, too.</p>
<p><strong>Live photography</strong><br />
The date is 08th May 1997. The place would be The Water Street Music Hall, Rochester,NY, USA. The author is Eric Haines. The photos are unusual, kinda lo-fi and more than awesome. You can view them <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/live/1997/0508-eric/">at this URI</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Magazine scans</strong><br />
Thanks to amazing Nini, who took her precious time to scan these gems, more magazine scans are available to download now. Some of them could use translation from Dutch and French, so if you're willing to help out, just shout.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/magazines/1989/08oor/">Oor, August 1989</a><br />
<a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/magazines/1999/06rockandfolk/">Rock &#038; Folk, June 1999</a><br />
<a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/magazines/2001/0203guitarbass/">Guitar &#038; Bass, February/March 2001</a><br />
<a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/magazines/2005/0924kerrang/">Kerrang!, 24th September 2005</a></p>
<p><strong>Live audio - Santa Barbara 2001</strong><br />
Another 2001 show is available for download in both mp3 and FLAC. Check it out <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/download/audio/solo/2001-04-26-santabarbara">here</a>. It's a bit shorter than the other 2001 shows, a bit unusually-sounding, but it's real, raw and it's there, so go grab it.</p>
<p><strong>By request: 2004 FAQ</strong><br />
Some people asked me if I can upload John's Q &#038; A from 2004. And what people ask for, people will get; unless it's illegal or a privacy violation. So, <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/download/audio/2004-q-and-a">here it is</a> and do read the disclaimer before you start quoting it in various places.</p>
<p><strong>Magazine articles</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/articles/2000-press/08-juice">Juice, August 2000</a> - typed by Naomi. This is basically an interview with Anthony Kiedis, basically, but he's talking about the whole band and there aren't that many interviews from 2000 online, so this is pretty relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Readers' wallpapers</strong><br />
New wallpaper by <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/fanart/wallpapers/leni/">Leni</a> as well as some by <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/v/fanart/wallpapers/">David &#038; Willy</a> have been added to the appropriate section.</p>
<p><strong>Other readers' submissions</strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again thanks to Chris Phillips, here is another exclusive outtake of the Hillingdon Mind interview with John, two part of which are already available ar <a href="http://www.hillingdonmind.org.uk/">hillingdonmind.org.uk</a>. This outtake continues on the <a href="http://www.hillingdonmind.org.uk/johnfrusciante_part2.php">second part of the interview</a>, but is omitted from the final version and kindly given to this website by its author.</p>
<blockquote><p>In music this idea is being express, and by the end of the song there’s every element of the music that has been doing something, is constantly at a different number than other things, and to top it off depending on where a musician puts something- in relationship to where the other musician puts something- these things seem to have sort of way of pushing and pulling at each another- of offsetting one another. The straightest drumbeat can sound like a really funky drumbeat if the guitar player is delicately placing his notes in between in certain ways. I’ve got the point where I’m constantly analysing music from this numerical standpoint, as I’ve become aware of a system of analysing music where it’s very graspable from these relationships. I’ve been learning music on my guitar my whole life studying- learning the bass part, learning the guitar part, learning the keyboard part, and I’ve noticed that in music I hear as being bad- it expresses very little about change- and that’s another thing that I feel like music is constantly expressing- is that change: that’s the nature of motion and movement, and in the end it’s nothing actually that’s changed… I’m getting off the subject. </p>
<p>In music that to my mind sounds good, it’s expressing the ideas like change- but there’s also a certain inter-relationship between the instruments. They’re not all constantly playing the same accents at the same time. They’re not all constantly following the same rhythmic structure. What happens in a good band- the guitar player is feeling the rhythm in one way and accenting certain rhythms in one way, the bass player- the way he’s accenting the rhythms contradicts what the guitar player is doing. It interweaves between them and it’s literally a contradiction. If the bass player was following the guitar player, there’s less room in that for it to be interesting, to me. What I like hearing is where the drummer is feeling the music in one way, and hitting certain accents, certain numbers- the guitar playing is hitting and feeling it in another way, and hitting on other numbers. What I’m doing is reducing the various potential 16th notes that a particular piece of music – every note on it is hitting more or less on one of those 16th , or 99% of the rock music that exists. </p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-2382"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>For example if you divide a bar into 16th notes- the guitar player may be accenting on the first one, the third one, and forth one, the seventh one- and the bass player may be accenting on the first one, the fifth one, the ninth one and so on. The guitar player may be playing soft, and the bass player playing loud- if they’re hitting on the same accents, what it creates is this constant…Each person is doing something different but at the same time they’re doing one thing together. This is a very pleasing idea because so often to a human being the world it seems like it’s this chaotic place where everybody’s doing something different, everybody believes something different, everybody has a different idea of what’s true and what’s false; everybody has their strong opinions about everything. There’s so much difference that it’s overwhelming and I think that it’s one of the pleasing things that music is expressing is that- yes… the bass is different from the guitar, is different from the drums, is different from the vocals- they’re all doing different things but they’re doing one thing together. This is something that families can’t seem to do and schools try to force on people and they can’t do it- and bands do it; classical composers do it; jazz musicians do it. </p>
<p>It shows that people can move in a type of harmony and that harmony exists as potential in the universe. I feel that this is one of the things that music is constantly expressing that is so pleasing and soothing to us. I think it must be part of the reason people look to music for its soothing qualities. I look to music for a lot of other things besides that, but people really seem to like it when there’s a certain type of mellowing effect on the mind and I think that this idea of there being differences, that it’s the reconciliation of those differences- it’s like an argument that’s finished. You may go to your school and the message that the teachers giving you could be reduced to numbers, it would be ‘No I say that 4 is 4 and 8 is 8, and 10 is 10 and 15 is 15’ and the message that music is telling you is 15 is 9 is 8 is 5 is 3. </p>
<p>That’s what’s happening if you analyse it in terms of numbers. Music is constantly saying 300 is the same thing as 200, is the same thing as 150. Because like I said the guitarist is on his 150th note- if you only heard the guitarist that’s on his 150th note, 150 would be all you could see. But when you notice that when it’s heard with the bass, with the drums, the bass is on 200, the guitarist is on note 150, drums and you know, might be on the 175th snare hit, on the 100th bass drum. There’s all these numbers that really we don’t keep track of them in our minds on any conscious way. Our brains, our subconscious, our brains are very advanced that way. We take in everything that comes in in detail like that. There’s just a drastic difference between every number to our brains and so to ear music express this idea that they’re all one thing and that they’re not different from one another is really pleasing in a world that tries to tell you ‘this is this way, that is that way’ ‘This is only what I say it is and nothing else’, and music it’s so open to be whatever you want it to be and even reduced to its numerical formulas. These formulas are very pleasing to people. I know it has to do with the numerical content of it.</p>
<p>Even the traditional pop song format, which is so pleasing to people for some god-damn reason. It’s the same numbers throughout. It’s like you have a 4 bar intro or an 8 bar intro; you have a verse that goes on for 16 bars or 32 bars- one or the other- not 17 bars, not 33 bars. Then you go into the chorus. That’s typically half the length of the verse. There are some songs where it’s a ¼ of the length or some songs where it would be 1/8th the length, or some songs where the chorus is one line, but that line last for you know- it’s always going to be a multiple of two. It’s usually going to be 4 or a multiple of 4. And 4 would be the shortest it would be. These are numbers that have been set in stone for 100’s of years- most music is written in 4/4. Though people aren’t aware of it, and the person that’s listening isn’t going to say ‘this song’s in 4/4’, unless they’re a musician. </p>
<p>But the fact is they don’t listen to any music that isn’t 4/4. When music isn’t in 4/4, it throws most people off. So to think, people don’t have a very real understanding of the numbers that are going on with the music. They’re appreciation of it is dependant on a certain type of organisation of those numbers. In a pop song format- after the first chorus you go back to the verse, and this verse is going to be the length of the first verse or it’s going to be half as long. Not 1/10th as long, not 1/12 as long. It’s very precise- it’s all in 4’s- and sections are half the length of another section or twice the length of another section. Also when the vocal comes in- that’s when you start counting how long that section is. The 2nd verse has an intro to it. That intro might be 2 bars or 4 bars, but once the singer comes in- the brain immediately says ‘one’. </p>
<p>You’re not conscious of the brain saying ‘one’, but that’s how we hear music. If it didn’t come in there, you’d think something was wrong. So the idea that this numerical organisation of music, it tells us something not so much about the music, but what our brains like to hear, and what our brains perceive as being organised. Where a cat hears music- they don’t hear it as being organised as we do, because that music was created with a human sense of organisation. Cats don’t perceive time in the same way we do, and so they can’t possible hear music in the same way we do. It’s organised by human beings for human beings. This need for it to be so structured as people have made it, I think is really unnecessary.' </p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second part of an exclusive interview with John is up on <a href="http://www.hillingdonmind.org.uk/">hillingdonmind.org.uk</a>. Thanks to the kindness of the interview's author, Chris Phillips, Invisible Movement was once again given the right to post an exclusive teaser. If you missed the first bit, <a href="http://www.invisible-movement.net/2365">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Chris Phillips talked to John about how music influences on one’s mind state and here's what John responded.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Everything that happens has a big influence on the state of mind. Our senses are constantly being bombarded with all kinds of things that are making a constant change to what goes on inside of us. We have so many tendencies that have been put in place by things that have happened to us in life, and everything that happens to us to some degree affects our tendencies in the future and affects our state of mind. To me what I’m noticing more with music- that separates it from incidents that happen- that change somebody’s state of mind, is that it seems to come through another channel besides the five senses. When the music is being created, the ideas enter the musician from an unknown source, through a channel that there’s no medical term for, no biological term, no psychological term for. There’s some channel that the ideas come through and the sense of musical balance that the musician employs in order to organise the ideas. That’s also something that there’s also no word for. It’s all the unknown, and a person that has a good sense of musical organisation has no idea where that sense came from. Partially it may come from loving and listening to music and really appreciating the balance and organisation of music that’s so cosmic, but there’s a lot of people who appreciate it that don’t have a sense of it, of how to manipulate that organisation, how to take control of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>And, though I could as well say nothing about it and though it is probably not my concern, I would like to advise some people not to make such quick judgements based on two b &#038; w photos. Some comments on the photos on Myspace yesterday were quite harsh and they sounded a bit like <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/flash/shmorky/babby.swf">this</a>, honestly. Being a person who's learned not to make quick judgements and who panickes too much, I figured out that such quick judgements might make people feel uncomfortable. So, think about it. There's a difference between being sensitive/concerned and being an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agony_aunt">agony aunt</a>. I doubt any of you would like to read that you "don't look well these days" ...?! I know I wouldn't!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given that the server can go down for various reasons - from overload to unoptimised database tables; and that the RSS feed and email notification aren't a guarantee that you'll receive all the updates, due to the enormous traffic on the site these days, I have created a <a href="http://twitter.com/IMnet">Twitter account for Invisible Movement</a>. In case you're not familiar with Twitter, it's basically a free service that lets you post short status messages and it is also very reliable.</p>
<p>Basically, whenever there's a new post in the news blog, I will post on Twitter. Whenever the site or the board aren't accessible for whatever reason, I will post on Twitter. Feel free to sign up to Twitter and add Invisible Movement to your follow list! You can follow the updates there without being registered, too. Consider it a back-up feed.</p>
