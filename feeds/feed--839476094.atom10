			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><a href='http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/601999_4.jpg'><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/601999_4.jpg" alt="" title="601999_4" width="480" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1286" /></a></center></p>
<p><a href="http://wireless.ign.com/articles/937/937278p1.html">Com2us has announced</a> the release of their new iPhone game <em>Chronicles of Inotia: Legend of Feanor</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299601999&#038;mt=8">App Store</a>] as an &#8220;action RPG with PC and console game graphic quality&#8221;.<br />
<blockquote> Players begin by creating a customized character with their choice of attributes, then set out on a journey to find the evil dragon Deathtaker, who disappeared after an epic battle. Villagers and vendors help along the way, and players can raise pets who enhance their attributes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The developers list the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old-school action RPG</li>
<li>PC, console-quality graphics and animation</li>
<li>Optimized touch control for iPhone </li>
<li>Gigantic map, items, all kinds of fantasy monsters </li>
<li>Dynamic weather, various quests, dealing, pet system</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve only spent a very brief amount of time with the title so far, so are unable to speak to the scope of the game.  The game, itself, however, seems well designed for the iPhone and of good quality.  The game begins with your character in a town.  You start with a short sword and 5 potions to replenish your health.  The small town you are in has a shop in which you can sell and buy equipment and a couple of townspeople to start you off with a couple of simple quests.  The initial portion of the game involves fighting off local creatures to increase your experience and gather goods to sell.</p>
<p><center><a href='http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/601999_2.jpg'><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/601999_2.jpg" alt="" title="601999_2" width="480" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1289" /></a></center></p>
<p>The control scheme involves tapping on the location on the map which directs your character to automatically walk towards that location.  Fighting is automatic and simply involves tapping on the enemy you would like to attack.  The menu system provides inventory, a list of active quests, your skills and experience. </p>
<p>A couple of the <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?threadid=2119">our early adopters in forum</a> seem pleased with the game even at this early stage.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/697067_3.jpg'><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/697067_3-200x300.jpg" alt="" title="697067_3" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1284" /></a></p>
<p>Munkyfun recently released their first iPhone game called <em>Ivory Tiles</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=298697067&#038;mt=8">App Store</a>].  Priced at only $1.99, this is a unique iPhone puzzle game that is particularly well designed and well suited for the platform.</p>
<p>The game is a puzzle game in which you must line up a tile or tiles to their appropriate location.  The tiles will move in the direction you tilt (or tap) until they reach an obstacle.  Through creative use of the obstacles and tiles, you frequently need to reposition the tiles to get them to slide into the appropriate spaces.</p>
<p><em>Ivory Tiles</em> includes 80 progressively more difficult levels.  Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 80 hand crafted levels to pit your brain against.</li>
<li>Progressive difficulty means kids can have fun playing the early stages.</li>
<li>Supports both tilt and touch input control.</li>
<li>Beautiful mahogany boards and ivory tiles rendered in realtime 3-D. </li>
<li>Soothing authentic traditional Chinese music arranged by &#8220;Silk &#038; Bamboo Ensemble&#8221; and &#8220;Cheng Yu&#8221;</li>
<li>Personal high scores tracked for each puzzle. Achieve Zen when you take it a step further and reach the &#8220;perfect&#8221; score.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s most striking about the game is its level of polish and the fact that it really feels like an iPhone game with the appropriate use of the accelerometer for sliding.  For those who prefer, touch control is also available.  </p>
<p>As always, the gameplay video shows it best. Note that for the purposes of filming, the tilt sensitivity was turned up very high.  It can be disabled completely if desired. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8xnAdHws2I">low resolution version also available</a>):</p>

<p>Digital Chocolate, Inc released their time management game <em>Chocolate Shop Frenzy</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299425091&#038;mt=8">App Store</a>] tonight.  This is another in a series of time management games that have invaded the App Store.</p>
<p>Others include <em>Diner Dash</em> (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289530584&#038;mt=8">$7.99</a>), <em>Sally&#8217;s Salon</em> (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=294026381&#038;mt=8">$0.99 - on sale</a>), and <em>Daycare Nightmare</em> (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297236654&#038;mt=8">$4.99</a>). </p>
<p>These games are well suited for the iPhone&#8217;s screen and involve juggling the defined tasks typically involving customer service.  In <em>Diner Dash</em>, you take orders, deliver food, collect checks and bus tables while managing a growing line of customers.  While these games may not appeal to everyone, they do seem to be a very popular genre.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <em>Chocolate Shop</em> release is also accompanied by a free demo version which limits you to the first month of the game&#8217;s story mode.   Worth a try for those unfamiliar with this type of gameplay:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1280" title="427316" src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/427316.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></p>
<p>Last night, Ngmoco released their fourth iPhone game called <em>Dropship</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299427316&amp;mt=8">App Store</a>].   The game was <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2008/10/19/coming-from-ngmoco-geometry-wars-meets-thrust/">said to be</a> inspired by both <em>Geometry Wars</em> and <em>Thrust</em> and it shows.</p>
<p>The retro-looking shooter puts you in command of a &#8220;Dropship&#8221; whose goal is to rescue stranded allies and also recover lost pods.   The game is essentially a 2D game but set in a 3D environment.  This causes some disorientation when you first play the game, but the end effect is remarkable.</p>
<p>The game succeeds on many levels, but perhaps the most critical piece that they got right were the controls.  Your ship is controlled by your left and right thumb which can be placed anywhere on their respective sides of the screen.  Left thumb controls thrust and right thumb controls the direction of firing.  There is a slight learning curve to this control method, but it ultimately allows very good control of your ship and avoids the major problems that come with a fixed button system (using up screen real estate, and accidentally hitting the wrong button).</p>
<p>The game offers two basic modes of play: Free Play and Campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free Play&#8221; is a more classic arcade mode in which you play progressively more difficult timed stages in which you must save a certain number of your allies before moving on to the next level.  You will have to fight off turrets, tanks and interceptors in the meanwhile.   Your ship loses energy as you take on damage, but this can be resupplied by collecting the blue debris left by your destroyed enemies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Campaign&#8221; mode offers 18 missions in which you must recover a lost pod.  You have to descend the level with your Dropship while fending off enemy cannons.  Once you find the lost pod, you must pick it up with your tractor beam and fly back to the surface.   But the pod can easily become dislodged if you go to fast or hit obstacles, so you have to be a bit cautious.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, extra levels can be downloaded from within the app itself, with three additional levels already available.   The mechanics of the game are well balanced which makes this a very fun and highly recommended game easily worth the $1.99 asking price.</p>
<p>This gameplay video shows off both Free Play and Campaign modes (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWLPoJhZKBU">low bandwidth version</a>):</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><a href='http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/779095_2.jpg'><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/779095_2.jpg" alt="" title="779095_2" width="480" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1278" /></a></center></p>
<p>Last night <em>Zombie Mansion</em> finally arrived in the App Store [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297779095&#038;mt=8">link</a>] after a prolonged approval process. <em>Zombie Mansion</em> was developed by <a href="http://www.sourceitsoftware.com/">Source IT software</a>.  The release of the title had been somewhat anticipated as it represents the first original first-person shooter (FPS) for the iPhone.  </p>
<p>The $4.99 game places you in the middle of a zombie filled mansion which you must fight your way out.<br />
<blockquote>Starting in Hell, you will manoeuver through the dungeons, the floors and finally the attic. Search for more powerful weapons and locate the keys you need to escape.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Our initial impressions of the game were a bit disappointing, however.  You start off in the middle of the mansion and must find your way out.  In your way are Zombies and doors.  In order to get through the doors, you need to find keys which are found somewhere in the mansion.  The game involves you wandering around the Mansion rather aimlessly trying to find a way out.   After a while,  I wasn&#8217;t sure I cared enough to keep looking around.  To be fair, beta testers claim the game does get more immersive over time.</p>
<p>Controls are also somewhat awkward with an on screen directional pad and shoot/jump/strafe buttons.</p>
<p>This video should give you a feel for the gameplay:</p>

<blockquote> Meet baddies like you&#8217;ve never seen that will literally eat you up and spit you out! Can you help your Fruit Friends make their way through grinding gears, around sticky webs and past wild turrets? There are twice as many Fruit Friends as before for you to guide and protect.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Tons of new enemies.</li>

<li>New bonus level rules!</li>

</ul>
<p>The introductory price is $2.99.  The game is currently listed as compatible with 2nd Generation iPod Touch and the iPhone, but this was an oversight which the developer says has been fixed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/deepgreen-play.png'><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/deepgreen-play-208x300.png" alt="" title="deepgreen-play" width="208" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1272" /></a><A href="http://cocoastuff.com/deepgreen/">Joachim Bondo released</a> an iPhone version of his mobile chess game <em>Deep Green</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299471086&#038;mt=8">App Store</a>].  The $4.99 Chess game was <a href="http://bondo.net/newton/deepgreen.html">originally released</a> for Apple&#8217;s Newton platform in 1998. </p>
<p>John Gruber, a fan of the Newton version, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/12/deep_green">describes the iPhone release</a> (Gruber is a bit of an interface fanatic):<br />
<blockquote> To be clear, this is not a port but a complete rewrite, with the same attention to detail, graphics, simplicity, and fun that marked the Newton version. For example, Deep Green for iPhone lets you move pieces either by drag-and-drop or by tapping a piece, then tapping the square you wish to move it to. (The tapped piece jiggles while waiting for you to tap the destination square.)</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Deep Green</em> also lists some notable features for Chess fans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play against engine or human, or engine vs. engine</li>
<li>Adjustable engine strength</li>
<li>Concentration setting allows the engine to play more like a human</li>
<li>Manual board setup</li>
<li>Playback game (forward/backward, animated replay, drag slider)</li>
<li>Take back moves (undo, all the way back to start)</li>
<li>Clean and beautiful user interface</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1268" title="048779" src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/048779.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></p>
<p>I.D.P has released a free side scrolling shooter to the App Store called <em>Space Deadbeef</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297048779&amp;mt=8">App Store</a>].</p>
<p>The game offers some simple controls to target your enemies.  You simply tap on your enemies to target your missiles.  And by tapping and holding on your own ship, you can build up a powerful shot which is launched when you release your finger. Your own ship movement is only up and down and it reacts to the same taps that you use for targeting.</p>
<p>The game is relatively simple and short lived &#8212; the same stage repeats with increasing difficulty (more shots fired from enemy ships) &#8212; but it seems like it could be the start of a great iPhone game. I&#8217;d hope the developer considers incorporating accelerometer based ship movements to divorce your ship&#8217;s movements from your aiming.   Here is a gameplay video from (I believe) the developer:</p>
