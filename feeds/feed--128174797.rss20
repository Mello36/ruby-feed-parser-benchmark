<p>The Pink Tentacle blog <a href="http://www.pinktentacle.com/2008/12/scientists-extract-images-directly-from-brain/">writes</a> <span class="footnote">(update: currently getting a quota exceeded message there)</span>:</p>

<p><q>&lt;&lt;Researchers from Japan’s ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories have developed new brain analysis technology that can reconstruct the images inside a person’s mind and display them on a computer monitor, it was announced on December 11. According to the researchers, further development of the technology may soon make it possible to view other people’s dreams while they sleep.<br /><br />

The scientists were able to reconstruct various images viewed by a person by analyzing changes in their cerebral blood flow. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, the researchers first mapped the blood flow changes that occurred in the cerebral visual cortex as subjects viewed various images held in front of their eyes. Subjects were shown 400 random 10 x 10 pixel black-and-white images for a period of 12 seconds each. While the fMRI machine monitored the changes in brain activity, a computer crunched the data and learned to associate the various changes in brain activity with the different image designs.<br /><br />

Then, when the test subjects were shown a completely new set of images, such as the letters N-E-U-R-O-N, the system was able to reconstruct and display what the test subjects were viewing based solely on their brain activity.&gt;&gt;</q></p>

<p>I just uploaded a video made a while ago showing the progress of the <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-10-09-n18.html">Mutating Pictures experiment</a> over several generations. To recap, in the experiment a pool of 1000 random symmetric polygon images was created, and everyone could then vote on how much an individual image looked like a face &#8211; with high-rated polygon mixes producing a lot of (mutated) offspring, and lower-rated producing little or no offspring. This way, generation by generation, the pool spread its more successful images and killed off the ones less face-like.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that the speed of the evolution in this experiment is not dependent on time, but rather on the number of people participating. In the first couple of days when many people participated, picture pool generations passed by quickly leading to many mutations and a fast face evolution (often the oldest living member in the pool of 1000 pictures was mere minutes old). After the first couple of days, traffic nearly died down, and so evolution came to a halt. The first days of the experiment created more power than the whole following year taken together:</p>

<p>Back during the experiment, Tomasz was inspired to put up a similar project with changed parameters. In his app <a href="http://facemaker.redshiftmedia.com/">Facemaker</a>, instead of voting from 0 - 10, you simply picked which of two given images looked more face like. Tomasz also used rounder shapes. Still, it&#8217;s interesting to see how after time passed, the results of Mutating Pictures and Facemaker often look similar, despite different code bases and approaches. Here are some of Facemaker&#8217;s results:</p>

<p><q>&lt;&lt;My dean once suggested that, when introducing a postmodern literary work to students who aren&#8217;t used to such things, I was setting myself up for failure by calling the work &#8220;difficult&#8221; or &#8220;challenging,&#8221; and instead suggested &#8220;quirky&#8221; or just &#8220;significant.&#8221;  I have another colleague who&#8217;s very good at listening to the terms used by people in other disciplines, and echoing those terms back in her conversation with them (so that, when speaking about the main idea of a scientist&#8217;s paper, she uses the word &#8220;hypothesis,&#8221; or when speaking about the main idea of an art installation, she refers to &#8220;concept&#8221;).<br /><br />
 
I think that if Google phrased it as the more natural-sounding &#8220;Report a problem,&#8221; or &#8220;Report a violation of privacy,&#8221; that could be taken as an admission of wrongdoing. By phrasing it so that the user seems merely to be sharing a personal feeling that something is uncomfortable, Google can assume the moral high ground.  &#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re concerned about it, are you? There, there... tell us about it, and we&#8217;ll make it all better..&#8221;<br /><br />
 
I had a boss who was a lawyer... he once asked me not to send out a press release with somebody saying &#8220;We are sorry...&#8221;  He told me that expressing &#8220;sorrow&#8221; implies taking responsibility for a bad thing, while writing &#8220;We regret...&#8221; is merely expressing sympathy.<br /><br />
 
So I imagine that Google&#8217;s lawyers wanted to come up with language that would appeal to people with real worries,  but not give any new ammunition to anyone who thinks Google is invading their privacy.  The phrasing does strike me as rather patronizing.&gt;&gt;</q></p>

<em style="font-size: 80%">A Smirnoff ad from a 1968 magazine (via <a href="http://adaholic.com">Adaholic</a>).</em></p>

<p>Google in their AdWords blog <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2008/12/update-to-adwords-alcohol-policy.html">announces</a> that they&#8217;re now starting to accept advertisements for hard alcohol in the US:</p>

<p><q>&lt;&lt;This fall, we changed our policy around beer, for the first time allowing advertisements of its sale in the U.S. via AdWords. And starting today, in response to advertiser feedback we&#8217;ve received over the years, we&#8217;ll permit the advertisement of hard alcohol and liqueurs that target the U.S.<br /><br />

To comply with the updated hard alcohol and liqueurs policy, advertisers must promote the information about hard alcohol and liqueurs that their websites contain, such as recipes and brand messages. Ads that directly promote the sale of hard alcohol and liqueurs are still not permissible through our program. In contrast, advertisements for beer may directly promote its sale.&gt;&gt;</q></p>

<p>(The bit about &#8220;in response to advertiser feedback&#8221; is interesting. Duh... an advertiser wants to advertise their product?)</p>

<p>Google lists the following example of an ad allowed under their policy: &#8220;you might market to individuals searching for helpful and relevant alcohol-related information by promoting holiday cocktail ideas or the caloric content of popular spiked beverages.&#8221; Google&#8217;s <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=guidelines.cs&amp;topic=9271&amp;subtopic=9279&amp;answer=47212">AdWords alcohol policies</a> state:</p>

<p><q>&lt;&lt;Ads are not permitted to directly promote the sale of hard alcohol and liqueur. This means that the sale of hard alcohol and liqueur cannot be promoted in ads or be the purpose of your site (occupying a significant portion of your site). However, ads for hard alcohol and liqueur with the sole purpose of branding may target the U.S. (...)<br /><br />

[P]lease ensure that your ad complies with our suggested alcohol advertising principles, which state that alcohol ads should:<br /><br />

&bull; Always be directed to an adult audience, and never targeted to those under the age of majority in the country where the ad is shown.<br />
&bull; Not be placed or run in venues where more than 50% of the audience is below the age of majority (higher percentages apply in certain countries).<br />
&bull; Only show models and actors who are, and appear to be, over 25 years old.<br />
&bull; Not contain any curative or therapeutic claims except as permitted by law.<br />
&bull; Not contain claims or representations that individuals can attain social, professional, educational, romantic, sexual, or athletic success as a result of alcohol consumption.<br />
&bull; Only promote responsible drinking, and not promote excessive drinking or the intoxicating effects of alcohol consumption.&gt;&gt;</q></p>

<p>Earlier this year, Google started <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-10-17-n11.html">allowing gambling ads</a> in the UK.</p>
