			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" src="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/specialevents/blog/Dr.%20Evil.jpg" alt="" width="152" height="187" />What a day&#8230; I woke up feeling very strange&#8230; almost reborn. All I knew is that as I stood up and looked over myself, I felt different. I felt&#8230; evil. It&#8217;s hard to describe but I felt as if everything that was good, every good thought, every moral belief, the notion of helping old orc women cross the ravine near Tarren Mill, just made&#8230; sick. Sick to my stomach. I needed to kill, I needed to pillage, I needed to do whatever evil actions I could get my hands on. If that consisted of stealing a baby blood elf&#8217;s golden pacifier then so be it. I needed my fix&#8230;</p>
<p>So it began, as I took my very first steps only to be greeted by a man whose own evil presence matched my own. As I stood there gazing upon him, I felt inspired. I felt as if this was what I wanted to be. This man in front of me seem to embody all that I felt was key in maintaining a happy life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_162535.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_162535.jpg" alt="WoWScrnShot_112108_162535.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>As I approached him, he turned towards me. Soulless orbs where his eyes should be met mine, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. It was almost as if this very being in front of me was the reason for my existence&#8230; my creator.. my master&#8230; my god&#8230; His first task for me was to use an eye to spy on a town that was to be the property of the Scourge. I felt no greater pleasure than to serve my loyal lich king.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_162429.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_162429.jpg" alt="The Lich King" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>So off I went as I took control of this eye in order to spy on the towns. I did as I was told and reported my findings back to the Lich King. Through his orders, I proceeded to relay the information to his officers as I completed they&#8217;re tasks. It was here that I met my first trusted companion, the steed that would carry me and my blade as it tore through the chest of those who dared to challenge the power that is the Lich King. I would name him Hilden and we would become an unstoppable force as we&#8217;d plow through the souls of the innocent. Yes&#8230; the innocent&#8230; that word itself causes my lips to salivate as to the punishment they deserve&#8230; all for my lord&#8230; I digress&#8230; Where was I? Oh yes&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_180555.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_180555.jpg" alt="WoWScrnShot_112108_180555.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Soon after, I met my other partner in crime. As any soldier of darkness would have, I came into my contact with my new pet frostwyrm. In order to avoid the obvious naming convention, I named him Frosty as his cute exterior would be the bait to lure my enemies in as I tear into their chests with my runed blade of death.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_180423.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_180423.jpg" alt="WoWScrnShot_112108_180423.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>And so we took off, with our occasional ghoul summons, pillaging and plundering the towns of the Scarlet Monastery. Feeling the blood of a helpless soul run over my sword further emphasized that this was where I needed to be&#8230; this was my calling.. this was my purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_180555.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_180555.jpg" alt="WoWScrnShot_112108_180555.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Some of our adventures took us to forms of trickery, where I even hid in the cart where a miner absentmindedly took me to their loading ship (take note how he completely ignored Frosty&#8217;s presence&#8230;further proof that insolent souls like this should be purged from this earth).  As the miner walked away, I proceeded to escape the cart and lay waste to their men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wowscrnshot_112108_181640.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" title="wowscrnshot_112108_181640" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wowscrnshot_112108_181640.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">Oh the feeling of cannonballs crushing through the chestplate of a man. It almost warms my heart&#8230;if I had one to warm of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">With that, I furthered my destruction in the name of the Lich King, as summoned the soul of the dead to help me waken these citizens from their slumber only to be placed in a more permanent one. The satisfaction was gratifying indeed&#8230;very gratifying&#8230;deliciously gratifying&#8230; but was the most pleasing was the word spoken to me before I laid one of the innocent victims to waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/guiltAttempt.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/guiltAttempt.jpg" alt="guiltAttempt.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Did she believe that attempting to instill guilt within me would prevent me from driving my blade of death through her heart? I would laugh if I could do so in the most evil way possible of course.</p>
<p>Finally, one of my last duties was to dress up as one of the Scarlet Soldiers. This provided the perfect cover as they&#8217;re inevitable slaughter took them by surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_183142.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><br />
<img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_193952.jpg" alt="WoWScrnShot_112108_193952.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_183142.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/gallery/avernus-vol-1/WoWScrnShot_112108_183142.jpg" alt="WoWScrnShot_112108_183142.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>After, I had proceeded to complete the tasks assigned me, the time of the final battle came upon us. The Scourge would finally take it&#8217;s place over the bringers of light and destroy all those who stood for things such as peace and justice. As our army arrived, we took siege to the soldier only to be blessed by the presence of our own Lich King! He took to the field beside us in arms as we fought. No day could of been truly prouder for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thickbox" href="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wowscrnshot_112108_210107.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center aligncenter" title="wowscrnshot_112108_210107" src="http://wfaworldwide.com/hkc/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wowscrnshot_112108_210107.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>However, the worst thing that could of happened, and we were defeated on the battlefield. As our lord fled, we were left. Now while I do serve my lord dutifully, I cannot do so if I am to be destroyed. We were offered a chance to serve next to them. How dare they insult us beyond defeat? While death would of been a true honor to my lord, I realized that living on would provide better in the long run. I would &#8220;ally&#8221; with these upholders of truth and light. They do not realize that I have bigger plans to return to my lord&#8217;s side. To fight with him once more as we see to the destruction of this abomination of justice. I will return to the battle on the side of my king, but I will have to gain the trust of these fools first.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-57" title="w1" src="/hkc/wp-content/themes/hkc/images/letters/w.png" alt="" />ell, as you can see by my last post, it has been quite a while&#8230; and with good reason too. The problem with the initial concept of this blog was that it lacked the forsight of my own personality. I had originally intended to write a blog dedicated my hunter and other hunter related material. What I SHOULD have realized was that I&#8217;m too much of an altoholic to stick to one character (especially now with the Recruit-a-Friend Bonus but I&#8217;ll save that for another post). So, although I love to learn about hunter strategies, theorycrafting, pets and all that other huntery goodness, I basically stuck myself in a niche that would ultimately conflict with my inner nature. So, how does one resolve such a dilemma? Well, one option would be to dedicate a separate blog to each character or class, but that would be as easy on my plethora <em>(is that the word for less than one?)</em> of readers as asking them to try to solo tame <a href="http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/mobs/mob_uvuros.php" target="_blank">Uvuros</a> with a level 1 Priest on heals. It&#8217;s completely unreasonable (though anyone who manages to accomplish said task will receive 20 HKC Stickers, useable in any HKC Store*). Another option would be to simply alter the overall theme of the blog to include all my characters and, as it stands, that will be the goal for this blog. I mean honestly, why should I pidgeonhole myself into a spot when we all know I won&#8217;t be <a href="http://bigredkitty.net/" target="_blank">BRK</a> anytime soon (I can still dream though). So with that I present to you the new, improved, and barely dressed, Huntard Kiting Club:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/6039" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/6039.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The wiseman of the group, Dazzlle enjoys pondering the many ways to eliminate his enemy. While not a fan of healing others, he&#8217;ll lower his standards once in a while if only given the chance to summon his shadowfiend and watch him slap people with his weird tentacle like arm thingys. He likes to melt faces, butter, and cheese and can often be seen running around in shadowform trying to trick people into thinking he&#8217;s actually being consumed by some weird black fire.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/6050" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/6050.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The poster boy for the HKC, he is the first member to venture to Outlands. He has a love for his many pets and won&#8217;t hesitate to use them at his disposal. Unfortunately, this can mean burning down enemies or getting them to make him warpstalker cupcakes. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/17303" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/17303.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The master of elements and tiny orb things around his torso, Huskar is not one to take lightly. His love for his pet wolves (Sammy and Whammy), is only parallel to that of Jakrathal with his pets. He likes to smash things hoping for a nice windfury crit. During the day he likes to spend his time in wolf form because he thinks it&#8217;s funny when they dance.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/4839" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/4839.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The tanker and rogue in plate, Rexxer likes to run at things and then when he&#8217;s there decides if he wants to fight. Sometimes he does, more often he doesn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s very versatile and doesn&#8217;t care if he&#8217;s beating his enemy up with a sword, axe, or rubber chicken. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/73310" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/73310.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>Known to many as &#8220;that lock dude&#8221; or &#8220;the lock with the unnaturally wide shoulders&#8221;, Demnok is one to break the mold. He&#8217;ll not hesitate to throw corruption on an enemy and do a jig while his enemy finds his life fading from him. He likes to play with demons and will probably end up staying that way, unless affliction lets him mount a felhunter or destruction lets him fling burning dung heaps.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/75375" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/75375.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The pretty boy of the bunch, Nordstrom is very conceited. With the only thing keeping his head from bloating is his god forsaken dance, he realizes that his potential will be unmatched. His style of combat is to make his opponent feel a chill either by a frostbolt or by leaving the air conditioner on in the winter.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/75373" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/75373.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The soft hearted big guy with a nasty temper, Raigorr is a tauren plagued with multiple personalities. As a tauren, he&#8217;s nice and likes to pet antelope but if pissed off, he&#8217;ll turn into a bear and proceed to rip the throat off said antelope. As a cat, he&#8217;ll proceed to stealth behind you and start making strange pawing motions with the hope that bad stuff will happen. Ironically, he loves burgers and steak dinners. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://wow.magelo.com/profile/75371" target="_blank"><img src="http://wow.sig.magelo.com/75371.png"   border="0" alt="" / rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"></a></p>
<p><em>The sneaky smart aleck stabber man, Azraith likes to wait till his enemies turn their back to sap and then <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pants#Verb" target="_blank">pants</a> </em><em>them. He likes to dual wield because two handers are for unevolved neanderthals. He&#8217;ll wait 10 hours in stealth just to make sure he gets the jump on you and when he does, be ready because if you yell at him loud enough, he&#8217;ll sprint.</em></p>
<h6><em>*The HKC Store doesn&#8217;t actually exist so the value of the stickers are actually worth less than pieces of used tissue but more than <a href="http://users.pullman.com/fjstevens/tokens/cec/CECdesigns.html" target="_blank">coins from Chucky Cheese</a></em><em>.</em></h6>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-size:100%;">It&#8217;s been a while since my last post but a lot has happened within the world of my hunter. For starters, I dinged 64 last night in Zangarmarsh. Dinging 64 means I get new skills and what skill was I most excited to get? Was it Rank 9 Raptor Strike? No&#8230; Was it Rank 9 Fire Trap? Not exactly&#8230; It was the aspect I&#8217;ve heard a lot about but was never able to try. I&#8217;m talking about Aspect of the Viper, but the question remains, is the hype over it warranted? </p>
<p>Well, lets analyze Aspect of the Viper(AotV)shall we.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/mn3mon1c/Huntard%20Kiting%20Club/Screenshots/aspect_viper.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>So according to the tooltip we see that with this aspect allow us to regenerate mana a lot faster than normal. How much faster?</p>
<p>Assume we have a hunter, let&#8217;s name him Jim. First, lets take into account Jim&#8217;s spirit. According to the mechanics of <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Spirit">spirit</a>, we see that for hunters in particular, we gain <a title="Spirit" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Spirit">Spirit</a>/5 + 15 per tick(where a tick is every 2 seconds). However, when we cast a spell(lay a trap, feign death, etc etc), our equation enters the &#8220;5 second rule&#8221; where our equation becomes<span style=";font-family:monospace;font-size:100%;"> </span><span style="font-size:100%;">37.5 + 0.5<a title="Spirit" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Spirit">(Spirit)</a>. So basically what this means, to those who are dizzy headed right about now at all this math, is that 1 point in your spirit will regenerate about .5 hp/mana per 5 seconds. Ok ok, enough talk lets see some hypothetical application.</span></p>
<p>Well lets get back to our very inexperienced huntard Jim. Lets assume he starts off with 1 spirit. Then his regen will look like this:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">.5 mana(1 spirit) per 5 seconds -&gt;</span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1 mana per 10 seconds -&gt; </span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />

</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-size:100%;">That&#8217;s seems all fine and dandy but when you consider that you could be giving up precious Agility or Stamina for that it starts to lose it&#8217;s appeal. However, we are not without a mana savior. Enter AotV.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">Now let&#8217;s assume Jim has 0 intellect. With AotV, this would have no impact what so ever, meaning that he would have to rely solely on this spirit. Now lets say Jim has 100 intellect. That means that every 5 seconds he receives:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">100*.50= 50 mana per 5 seconds.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">Now for arguments sake let&#8217;s say that Jim has around 40 spirit and 50 intellect for whatever reason. Now normally out of battle this would equate to 20 mana per 5 seconds or 20( 12) = 240 mana a minute with just spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">Not too bad but not good if you just blew your mana load on some mob. We slap on AotV and lets see the change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">After casting a spell we enter the 5 second rule, meaning we gotta wait 5 seconds before getting regen from our spirit. That means that the AotV will start regenerating:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">50 * .50 = 25 mana per 5 seconds</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">After those inital 5 seconds our spirit kicks in then we get:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">.5(40) per 5 seconds = 20 mana per 5 seconds</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">25+ 20 = 45 per 5 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">That means in a minute we get:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">25 + 45(11) = 520 mana</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">In conclusion this means that in one minute with no AotV, Jim would regain 240 mana vs 520 with AotV on. That&#8217;s a difference of 280 mana a minute which is a lot considering time is everything. So is it worth it to switch to AotV, mid battle? Well, considering spirit only regains during non-combat, it becomes necessary that we try to utilize AotV whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;">Now if your one of those people who love macros to do things quicker(I know I am), I borrowed a macro from <a href="http://www.bigredkitty.blogspot.com/">BigRedKitty</a>(I promise I&#8217;ll give it right back<br />
^-^):</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size:100%;">Aspect of the Hawk/Viper Swap Macro</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong><em>/castsequence Aspect of the Hawk, Aspect of the Viper</em></strong></span></p>
<p>This will allow you to switch between AotH and AotV on the fly. Hope my little analysis helped, if at all. Till next time HKC Members.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally did it. I dinged 62 and I was able to tame my ravager. Isn&#8217;t she beautiful? Her name is Nora and she will proceed to do the killing for now. Tofu was banked and I don&#8217;t see him coming back out anytime soon.</p>
<div>
<p align="center"><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/mn3mon1c/Huntard%20Kiting%20Club/Screenshots/Tamed_Ravager.jpg"   rel="lightbox"  rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img style="width: 454px; height: 364px;" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/mn3mon1c/Huntard%20Kiting%20Club/Screenshots/Tamed_Ravager.jpg" border="0" alt="" height="313" /></a><br />
<em><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">We make a pretty damn good looking couple.</span></strong></em></p>
<div>I will also say one thing: Ravagers are threat machines. It&#8217;s so hard for me to get anything away from her. With Tofu (my windserpent), I&#8217;d have to wait for him to build up threat before I could start Pew Pew. However, with Nora, once I sent her to attack, her Bite and Gore began the massive focus dumping and aggro building. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m not saying I don&#8217;t like Windserpents anymore. It&#8217;s just right now I think Tofu and I need some time to ourselves. Unfortunately, since I just tamed Nora, she only knows Bite (Level 8 ), Gore (Level 8 ) and Growl (Level 7). I want to teach her Dash but I gotta wait for her to start liking me before she gets any skill points. According to <a href="http://www.maniasarcania.com/2007/09/10/loyalty-gain-time-and-experience/">Mania&#8217;s Research</a>, I should be getting her to like me as a Best Friend in 90 minutes of work. We&#8217;ll see about that&#8230;</p>
<p>In other news, I replaced that dagger I had with <a class="q3" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30855">[Shatterstone Pick]</a> and FINALLY replaced my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17753">[Verdant Keeper's Aim]</a> with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25496">[Mag'har Bow]</a>. Now I can try to do some major Pew Pew&#8217;n.</div>
<p>I also managed to do one of the MOST creative, and I don&#8217;t mean that lightly, quests that I have ever done. So basically, the premise of this quest was to kill some Hellboars and have this summoned Fel Hound eat them. Why did I have to do that? Well I had to find a key. Where was the key? In the Fel Hound&#8217;s poo of course, where else?</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/mn3mon1c/Huntard%20Kiting%20Club/Screenshots/Reaver_Poo.jpg"   rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img style="width: 382px;" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v282/mn3mon1c/Huntard%20Kiting%20Club/Screenshots/Reaver_Poo.jpg" border="0" alt="" height="282" /></a><br />
<strong><em><span style="font-size:85%;">Demon Poo&#8230;MMM Delicious</span></em></strong></p>
<p align="left">Well fortunately for me, I was able to get the key on the first try. However, running alongside a Fel Hound will definitely give a hunter hope&#8230;</p>

<p>I also managed to get my first Daily PVP quest done for some nice Thrallmar reputation. I saw all the Leatherworking Recipes they sell and I can&#8217;t wait to start cranking them out.</p>
<p>Still got a lot more quests in Hellfire Peninsula and then comes the idea of whether or not I should do the instances there&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Yesterday, I finally got around to playing again. It seems that schoolwork has kept me quite busy, preventing me from indulging myself in the TBC content. I did get a couple quests done and as quest rewards I managed to get two new daggers. I never used daggers before although I previously opted to train all of the weapons. It came in handy last night when I got those daggers. The thing is, I had my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19106">[Ice Barbed Spear]</a> and it&#8217;s a pretty good weapon for my level, but now I had the option of switching it for these two daggers, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29909">[Screaming Dagger]</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29914">[Hellfire Skiver]</a>.</p>
<p>First thing I noticed was the dps on the daggers together was A LOT faster than my polearm, as it should be since they&#8217;re daggers. However, my white hit with the daggers was estimated to be around 150 - 200 damage each hand and with the polearm it was around 349-428. The agility gain for the the daggers, however, was about 9 lower than the polearm but my hit rating and my RAP was a bit more with the daggers. I then wondered: Is it better to have faster dps and less agility or less dps and more agility? Well, if I was planning to go pure PVE then the polearm would have most likely been my choice. However, since I&#8217;m in a PVP server, and I do like my share of PVP(both world and battlegrounds), I wondered if faster dps would really be that harmful to me. I know from reading BRK that 2 handed weapons tend to be preferred for PVE than dual wielding due to their usually higher agility bonus.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter since I have <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23499">[Fel Iron Greatsword]</a> in the bank but it&#8217;s the logic that I want to know. End game PVP, Should I go Dual wield or two-handed?</p>
<p>In other news, I saw my first wild ravager(Regular and Hatchling) today. Pretty exciting since I have been wanting to get one since I saw they were tameable. However, I don&#8217;t want just any red ravager. My general rule of thumb is, if it&#8217;s going to be my pet, it HAS to be green. Thus the ravager I&#8217;m eyeing is the <a href="http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/mobs/mob_quillfangravager.shtml">Quillfang Ravager</a>. </div>

<p>
<p align="left">It&#8217;s green and has eyes that just portray pure intent to kill. When I get it, things will certainly get a bit more interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>Till next time</p>
