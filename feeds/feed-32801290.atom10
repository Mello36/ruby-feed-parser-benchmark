Do you launch a blog? Do you start a Twitter account? Do you launch your own Vlog? Or maybe some combination of all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get some more clarity on this I interviewed Dan Schawbel the author of the &lt;a href="http://www.personalbrandingblog.com"&gt;Personal Branding blog&lt;/a&gt;. He will also be releasing a new book called &lt;a href="http://www.personalbrandingbook.com/"&gt;Me 2.0: Build a Powerful Brand to Achieve Career Success&lt;/a&gt; (due out with Kaplan in April 09). In my opinion, Dan is also the hardest working guy in Social Media posting 10 times a week on his blog, publishing his own &lt;a href="http://www.personalbrandingmag.com/"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; and book as well as having a full time job as the social media expert for EMC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe border="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://www.veotag.com/player/?pid=4bf608b4-1d4d-40e0-ab04-ed3ffbf7c41a&amp;amp;mode=embedded&amp;amp;autostart=0" scrolling="no" width="429" frameborder="0" height="464"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/72206-80605/Media/Dan%20Schwabel%20Podcast%20FINAL.mp3"&gt;Link to Original Audio Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BuzzMarketingForTechnology"&gt;Signup for this Podcast Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Dan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Schawbel is the leading personal branding expert for Gen-Y.

There are some major shifts in landscape in which they operate: changes in Technology, Consumer Behavior and the Media Landscape. In a recent research report entitled &lt;a href="http://a330.g.akamai.net/7/330/25828/20080909164450/graphics.eiu.com/upload/Google%20Text.pdf"&gt;Future Tense: the Global CMO&lt;/a&gt; published by the Economist Intelligence Unit I hope to recap some of the most salient points of this paper as I see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing is moving from a pure brand image play to something much more interesting. “Now the ability to communicate the marketing message to consumers through interactive media is critical.” To me this means – marketing must be able to create and package great ideas for consumption of the right audience – think the spread of great ideas (credit Seth Godin - Idea Virus). If you have a story worth repeating, bloggers, podcasters, etc will repeat your story all over the world thereby building buzz and your brand at the same time. This is becoming an art in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While print advertising is still plays a role, high level executives are using search, forums, blogs and even Twitter (see &lt;a href="http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/12/c-level-tweeters.html"&gt;C Level Executives who use Twitter&lt;/a&gt;). So your information has to be out there in all formats which means you must be more integrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon Iwata, SVP of Marketing and Communications for IBM said “If you think backward from the audience you’re trying to reach and the channels and methods you’ve used to try to reach them, it all argues for taking a much more integrated approach to the work of marketing and communications.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to this what I consider the secret sauce which is tracking and nurturing leads. A whopping 64% of survey respondents say that the global marketing head has served for less than three years. While this revolving door of marketing is alarming – the way to “break free of this relevancy crisis is to absolutely be accountable for the one and only metric that counts to a business and that’s growth [in sales].” (see &lt;a href="http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/07/marketing-metrics-rethinking-them-again.html"&gt;Rethinking Metrics Again&lt;/a&gt;) This can only be accomplished with a strong lead management or lead nurturing process to graduate leads to sales and track ROI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken together I think there is a prescription for the evolving CMO. Strong online acumen with all forms of new media and accountability through lead nurturing that proves the value of every dollar spend contributed to growth in sales!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/677918786217703045/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=677918786217703045' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/677918786217703045'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/677918786217703045'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/12/cmo-of-future.html' title='CMO of the Future'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/ST6eQJn8MfI/AAAAAAAAAV8/KWr1-zf7O-I/s72-c/Future+Tense+CMO.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-4106388538237935899</id><published>2008-12-04T16:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-12T09:10:04.102-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Twitter'/><title type='text'>C Level Tweeters</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/STh8LMh2ibI/AAAAAAAAAV0/w-VnOtM8-TM/s1600-h/twitter-logo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 128px; height: 128px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/STh8LMh2ibI/AAAAAAAAAV0/w-VnOtM8-TM/s400/twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276103495248153010" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is a list of confirmed C Level Executives that are using Twitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have names that should be added to this list, please post them using the comments feature at the bottom of this post and I’ll get it included ASAP -

But truly differentiated and provocative thought leadership is actually hard to come by. Most of the time, it is just interesting theory without any proof. Moreover, does the thought leadership actually drive the business and create sales or is it just content for content sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a better understanding of this space I decided to interview Bob Buday the co-founder of &lt;a href="http://www.bloomgroup.com/"&gt;The Bloom Group&lt;/a&gt; whose firm specializes in the creation of cogent and well differentiated thought leadership. Bob is also the co-author of a new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thoughts-Leadership-Insights-Creating-Professional-Services/dp/0615224164"&gt;Thoughts on Thought Leadership&lt;/a&gt; which is a great resource for anyone working to create thought leaders in their organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe border="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://www.veotag.com/player/?pid=3ce45193-8b4a-441d-806f-1565154e3246&amp;amp;mode=embedded&amp;amp;autostart=0" scrolling="no" width="429" frameborder="0" height="464"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/72206-80605/Media/Bob%20Buday%20Podcast%20FINAL.mp3"&gt;Link to Original Audio Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BuzzMarketingForTechnology"&gt;Signup for this Podcast Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Bob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Buday is a co-founder of The Bloom Group and has been a researcher, marketing strategist, and writer for consulting and IT companies for 15 years. Prior to launching The Bloom Group, Bob for 10 years was director of marketing communications at CSC Index. He played a leading role in making the consulting concept of “business reengineering” a household word, directing Index’s extensive publications, PR, and survey research activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the development and marketing of reengineering, Index’s revenues grew from $30 million to $250 million in less than a decade. Bob was instrumental in the development and placement of two Harvard Business Review articles. He launched and directed the firm’s popular Insights Quarterly management publication, its annual study of information systems management issues, and its 1994 study of reengineering initiatives, which The Economist said was the most extensive study of reengineering to date. He also played a key role in promoting three best-selling books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transferring the lessons learned from marketing consulting concepts to the marketing of other complex products (particularly IT), Bob co-authored “Marketing Breakthrough Products,” published in the Harvard Business Review in 1999.  His most recent Harvard Business Review piece, "A Consultant's Comeuppance," was published in the February 2003 issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob’s passion for research and writing about the business implications and applications of IT began in 1985, when he joined InformationWeek magazine as a senior editor. At InformationWeek, the No. 1 magazine on information technology for senior IT and business executives, he led coverage of the strategic use of IT and the software industry. Before joining InformationWeek, he was a business writer at The Orange County (Calif.) Register, where he wrote news and feature stories on companies in the real estate, consumer products, health care, IT, retailing and other industries. He has a B.A. in communications studies from Penn State University and did graduate work in an MBA program at California State University, Fullerton.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/4555025892356651185/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=4555025892356651185' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/4555025892356651185'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/4555025892356651185'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/12/how-to-develop-thought-leaders.html' title='How to develop Thought Leaders'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/STh1YbeVNJI/AAAAAAAAAVs/K3gVSWp3Tys/s72-c/Thoughts+on+Thought+Leadership.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-4552943666084740626</id><published>2008-12-02T06:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-02T07:15:51.708-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><title type='text'>Social Media Budget Ratio</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/STVPaP4fx1I/AAAAAAAAAVc/iMoH_K491Lc/s1600-h/Social+Media+Bubble.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 310px; height: 184px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/STVPaP4fx1I/AAAAAAAAAVc/iMoH_K491Lc/s400/Social+Media+Bubble.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275209850893092690" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After my last post on the &lt;a href="http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/10/media-budget-ratio-how-much-should-b2b.html"&gt;Media Budget Ratio&lt;/a&gt; I got a question out on the &lt;a href="http://www.marketingtwo.net/"&gt;Marketing 2.0 community&lt;/a&gt; by Scott Zosel about how much should you allocate for Social Media in your budget?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great question Scott and you inspired me to write this post. So here it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the technology used for social media is rather low. Take for example - a blog - costs next to nothing, a podcast can cost btw $0 and $2000 on the high end, a video can cost btw $0 and $10,000 - $15,000, a wiki can cost about $6500 a year, a community can cost btw $0 (Ning) up to $100,000 a year for a private branded community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unlike traditional media – Print, TV and Radio - which can cost big money. Social media’s upfront costs very little and we actually use money within my team to experiment with so we A) get a better understanding of the technology and B) start to understand how we can use it and measure the results along with all the other media we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok but the real cost (again unlike the traditional media stuff) is in Content Creation to fill up those social media / new media channels - here is where the cost can get large. I happen to think I am very fortunate since I work at a consulting firm where many people are thought leaders - so we have no shortage of opinions ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap - I would say (as I did in my post on the Media Budget Ratio) that traditional media should run you now 2/10s of 1% of revenues and your Social Media Budget Ratio should be at least 25% of your Traditional Media Budget (including content!)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/4552943666084740626/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=4552943666084740626' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/4552943666084740626'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/4552943666084740626'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/12/social-media-budget-ratio.html' title='Social Media Budget Ratio'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/STVPaP4fx1I/AAAAAAAAAVc/iMoH_K491Lc/s72-c/Social+Media+Bubble.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-5774316413440739138</id><published>2008-11-25T17:44:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-25T18:02:21.263-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Strategy'/><title type='text'>Proven Big M Marketing Techniques</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SSyt7fkpPFI/AAAAAAAAAVM/9jS9mKhOn0M/s1600-h/chartvase.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SSyt7fkpPFI/AAAAAAAAAVM/9jS9mKhOn0M/s400/chartvase.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272780501343091794" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Marketing is the interface a company builds to interact with the marketplace and the customer base.

A veteran Silicon Valley marketer, Guzeman founded the Mindpik consultancy in 1988 to develop sales and marketing programs for new product launches, startups and turnarounds. Guzeman directs all of Mindpik's efforts to build business plans for capital acquisition or sales of companies or products to targeted markets.

But here is some real data that you can use to illustrate why that is a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McGraw-Hill Research study of over 600 Businesses found that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1981-1982 – business that maintained or increased their ad spend during this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Averaged higher sales growth during the recession and in the following 3 years!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1985 – sales of the businesses that maintained or increased their ad spend during that recession&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales had risen 256% over those that had cut back on advertising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise in 2001 – another study found that aggressive recession advertisers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased market share 2 ½ times the average for all businesses in the post-recession&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2002 – the Strategic planning institute illustrated that during economic expansion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although 80% of businesses increased their advertising spend there was NO improvement in market share&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why? - because everyone has increase ad spending!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Full Disclosure&lt;/span&gt;: I got these stats from a paper called &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/7450921/Innovating-Through-Recession-Andrew-Razeghi-Kellogg-School-of-Management"&gt;Innovating through a Recession&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Andrew J.

And at the same time cause marketing was starting to take hold. Lee studied the causes that women really identified with and breast cancer was a clear winner. Lee wanted to do something because over 44,000 women a year die from breast cancer each year in the US. But they wanted to give the consumer the ability to make a difference. So they started the “pay $5 to wear jeans to work” on the first Friday of every October (aka - breast cancer awareness day) and wanted to create Lee national denim day. Over the last 13 years they raised $75M for breast cancer research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of the program they were breaking ground – now it’s seems like a “sea of Pink” – So welcome to Web 2.0 it’s no longer about pushing information out – it’s about consumers generating conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hub was &lt;a href="http://www.denimday.com/"&gt;http://www.denimday.com &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They made sure the site was a real online community for men, women and companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You sign up, create a “team” and tell your story as a way to recruit and harness UGC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They started building outpost sites on MySpace, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube – tapping into existing communities – making it extremely seamless with denimday.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They made sure it is searchable and found at the top of Google and Wikipedia page and it is updated all the time. That’s when the messaging really started to spread like widefire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They added celebrity ambassadors like Ellen DeGeneres and allow folks to connect with their ambassadors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also used The Office TV show to create a Public Service Announcement (PSA) and got a 60% conversion rate because of that program off of YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They harnessed blogs and message boards – “be very careful if you are trying to sell them – must be a very genuine conversation” Went to breast cancer blog sites – tried to give relevant information and how they can join in National Breast Cancer Awareness day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Billy Ray Cyrus – tapped into a whole group of country music fans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips and tricks of the Lee Jeans program&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Empower participants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Embrace the transparency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communicate regularly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tag everything&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure consistency in the look and feel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do your homework do not “pitch” bloggers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be prepared for commentary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to quantify value from cause marketing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can see a direct correlation and high share of wallet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the last 13 years – the brand that cares for me – is one that you recommend to others!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Do a Social Audit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be done continuously – have people monitoring daily on various type of social networks as well as the blogosphere&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the conversation being held about the brand and where&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As well as Denimday – what is being said&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/7744832954669911127/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=7744832954669911127' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7744832954669911127'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7744832954669911127'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/11/successfully-engaging-customers-with.html' title='Successfully Engaging Customers with a Cause'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SRhECR2BGNI/AAAAAAAAAUk/toAVFNAxiek/s72-c/Lee_Denim_Day2006.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-6877126377682781231</id><published>2008-11-06T07:35:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-06T08:23:49.049-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><title type='text'>Secrets of Social Media Marketing – a podcast with Paul Gillin</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SRMaAgMn-rI/AAAAAAAAAUc/gtdKY5_8MXY/s1600-h/secrets+of+social+media.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 277px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SRMaAgMn-rI/AAAAAAAAAUc/gtdKY5_8MXY/s400/secrets+of+social+media.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265580985271450290" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is no doubt the speed of change in the media space is blinding. New tools become available to marketers and individuals alike nearly every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever felt like it is hard to keep up (and I know I have) then this book is for you. Admittedly, Paul Gillin wrote this book for the 90% of marketers still trying to figure out social media, I can tell you it makes and excellent resource for even the most polished social media expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul covers topics like how to sell your social media program to by making a strong case, how to be a good listener using DIY tools across many types of media, how to find and court influencers, how to make social media worthy content and measuring results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy of his book and really enjoyed reading because it gave me ideas I can put into play immediately.

Social tools like blogs and social networking sites are helping crowds form around very discrete topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what is missing from these crowds are leaders. Like any social network that you may join you have those that join and just lurk, those that maybe make a comment or contribute but then you have those who stand up, take some initiative and lead! And that’s what these social networks really need is more leaders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what Seth Godin’s new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336%3FSubscriptionId%3D19BAZMZQFZJ6G2QYGCG2%26tag%3Dsquid504575-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1591842336"&gt;Tribes&lt;/a&gt; is all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the internet is a great place for Ukrainian Folk Dancers because now for the first time people who love Ukrainian Folk Dancing can ban together and create their own “Tribe”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an important fact since traditional media is no longer working. There is just too much noise out there to shout at people. No consumer brand has been built on the back of traditional media for a while now. TV certainly isn’t working for the creation of new consumer or B2B brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means your only option is to define your brand in a way that is open to a dialog (no &lt;a href="http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/08/command-control-branding-not-dead-yet.html"&gt;Command and Control branding&lt;/a&gt; please) and in a way that is narrow enough to start or tap into a “movement”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take for example – Harley Davidson – here is a consumer brand that also is a movement a Tribe. Take from the brand what you want and maybe even lead your own Tribe in your own area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth recently held an event in NY to bring his own Tribe together. You can &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sethgodin/seth-godin-on-tribes-presentation"&gt;view his slides&lt;/a&gt; here and you can listen to the &lt;a href="http://cdn2.libsyn.com/marketingovercoffee/MoC083-Seth-Godin.mp3?nvb=20081025175510&amp;amp;nva=20081026175510&amp;amp;t=0f79922bffb30e7cfa2a1"&gt;audio of his presentation&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the highlights from my notes were&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 elements of leaders&lt;br /&gt;-    Challenge – leaders challenge their tribe&lt;br /&gt;-    Culture – leaders create a culture within the tribe&lt;br /&gt;-    Curiosity – leaders open up a curiosity gap for outsiders&lt;br /&gt;-    Charisma – being a leader gives you charisma&lt;br /&gt;-    Communicate – leaders communicate&lt;br /&gt;-    Connect – leaders connect others in the tribe&lt;br /&gt;-    Commit – to the movement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 things tribes want&lt;br /&gt;-    Connect – they join to connect with others&lt;br /&gt;-    Create Meaning – joining gives them purpose&lt;br /&gt;-    Make a difference – joining allows them to make a difference&lt;br /&gt;-    Be Noticed – they join to be noticed&lt;br /&gt;-    Matter – they join because it matters to them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing management is now Tribal leadership. Start doing things for people not to them.

If I stop creating tension or pushing the envelope - I will be fired. And whenever someone says I am getting a little to edgy I show them the - &lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2008/08/04/alleged-extended-sta.html"&gt;ExtendedStay viral video&lt;/a&gt; – that usually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick – My role was to guide us thought a crisis time where we launched a 10M ad campaign to stem redemptions and customer defections – now our customer numbers are up, revenue are up, retention is up – CMO role is about acting when the chips are down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ – CMO role is defined by being the best all around athlete – it takes the Power of Versatility. The Burger King was a brand people “knew more than loved” – I needed to turn that around – re-mystify the brand so consumers would reengage with the brand to become a “brand people would love to know more about” Digital was a perfect choice for that. Moved past the banner ad quickly to get into “content generate share of voice” rather than buying eyeballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Messaging in the digital world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick – web is our storefront – need to try to get more customers engaged with our brand online – I don’t have the fortitude to pull all the print and ad dollars offline. Don’t care about the price of media as long as it meets the target CPA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff – Moving the business model from broadcast to a narrowcast model. There is a 400 employees twittering with Kodak in their name – have to acknowledge how the brand is being using – don’t necessarily condone it or endorse it. The Apprentice integrated campaign mentioned Kodak 4.4 times per minute for 43 minutes – to make it more relevant to end users – making it more branded content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ – there is user generated content which we love to fuel but there is “Content Generated Share of Voice” – if you get a 1/2 Billion hits on a viral video – what can you do to get that to spread?

Then once an ad is delivered – users are allowed to search and discover full-line catalogs and T-commerce right from the set top box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line – TV becomes much more like the internet (IPTV) but with broadcast programming and ads will be bought and delivered like internet advertising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just another thought - Can you envision a crossover of web programs to TV?

Candidly I have wanted to use more video for my own blog so I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my team knows I have been looking for ways to incorporate video in the marketing mix at BearingPoint not just as a nice to have but as a staple of our interactive go-to-market. And with the proliferation of tools out there to allow you to capture video that should be easy right? After visiting Doug’s facility I can safely say it’s still hard to do if you want to do it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug has an award winning Communication Company and he started a Vlog to document the change he see going on in his industry. Check out his &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/welcome-to-d-s-simon-vlog-views-2/"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; captured on his Vlog and some of the impressive names he has been able to interview from companies like: &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/jennifer-martin-cnn/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/the-growing-role-of-pr-stuart-elliott-the-new-york-times/"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/paula-berg-southwest-airlines/"&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/steven-haft-allscreen-studios-burson-marsteller/"&gt;Burson-Marsteller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/mark-senak-fleishman-hillard/"&gt;Fleishman-Hillard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is our talk about how BearingPoint is using Social Media to help define the brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/players/paul_dunay.html?pid=3a70O_gVcP4wrE__rpdEROTtTgvot9sG" width="330" height="268" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is a link to his original post - &lt;a href="http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/paul-dunay-bearingpoint/"&gt;http://www.dssimonvlogviews.com/paul-dunay-bearingpoint/&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/2485953868401818588/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=2485953868401818588' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/2485953868401818588'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/2485953868401818588'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/10/vlogging-with-doug-simon.html' title='Vlogging with Doug Simon'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-177355392191879271</id><published>2008-10-21T06:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-21T06:56:40.464-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ROI'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Interactive Marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email Marketing'/><title type='text'>Using Email to Improve Profit</title><content type='html'>Normally email and profit don’t go in the same sentence at least in the minds of most B2B marketers – but actually they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything has a cost associated with it and email is no exception – so this podcast focuses on how much lift in revenues and profits you can get out of your email program if you are in B2C or B2B marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To accomplish this I decided to speak to Steve Webster, Chief Strategy Officer from &lt;a href="http://www.ipost.com/"&gt;iPost&lt;/a&gt; who has published several case studies on the topic of improving profits via email.

BearingPoint is searching for some new thinking on the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We launched a contest on Facebook to gather the 'wisdom of the crowd' on how businesses can become more environmentally conscious in their operations. Facebook users can contribute their ideas and pass them along to their friends and the larger Facebook community to vote on by Nov. 15. (And yes, the winner gets a green prize!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a contest or giveaway on Facebook is not new, the use of Facebook as a method of crowdsourcing is.

Digital signage is officially "the next big thing" for a lot of marketers. In a recent Razorfish survey it was ranked second to mobile as the most important emerging media channel in the coming year. Roughly 51 percent of respondents ranked mobile as the most important, followed by Digital Signage with nearly 32 percent. Other channels trailed by a wide margin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-06/st_alphageek"&gt;article in Wired Magazine&lt;/a&gt; they featured a company called MegaPhone that combined both of these emerging areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MegaPhone is a mobile gaming company whose latest project is to connect cell phones with games embedded in big-screen billboards in places like you guessed it … Times Square!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People can interact with these billboards via a special phone number which will show them as special avatars identified by the last four digits of the caller’s phone number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first read the article I thought it was just another super geek application but the more I thought about it – the more you can think up new applications for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, Jumbotrons at sporting events where they can pick attendees to play an engaging mini game of basketball, baseball, football, hockey, or whatever sport you are watching. Rock Concert goers could dial into the Jumbotron to participate in a live chat with the band backstage. Tradeshow events could use this to allow real time Twittering and live Q&amp;amp;A via mobile. Anywhere you are waiting in line – airports, hotels, on airplanes, amusement parks (read Disney) could not only pre-engage their audience with the ride – perhaps they could let us sign up for tickets once we enter the park and call us when we are due to blast off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one article opens up the wide world of mobile marketing, digital signage and more importantly a glimpse at the future of social media marketing (SMM).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/7371781339690141167/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=7371781339690141167' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7371781339690141167'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7371781339690141167'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/10/digital-signage-next-big-thing.html' title='Digital Signage – the Next Big Thing'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SPNvMytcmqI/AAAAAAAAAR4/S2ZsKBzsQmY/s72-c/Interactive+Billboard.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-364954048391650962</id><published>2008-10-07T18:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-07T18:15:03.531-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Interactive Marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Events'/><title type='text'>Putting in place a Virtual Events strategy</title><content type='html'>If you are an avid reader of this blog you will already know that I am fascinated with Virtual Worlds and Virtual Events – but I was never truly enamored with Second Life and was not in favor of it for business from the start (must have been that scary looking penguin that tried to strike up a conversation with me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside – I encounter a virtual world from the moment I step foot into my house with my two boys being avid &lt;a href="http://www.runescape.com"&gt;RuneScape&lt;/a&gt; players. So I can’t help but think there must be something redeeming here for businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I am investigating and heavily considering for 2009 is a Virtual Events Strategy. It’s like a virtual tradeshow but a space all your own for your own business events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I decided to speak to Stuart Bowen who has put into place a virtual events strategy a few times now and is currently doing this for ON24. Don’t miss his insights into what you should be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe border="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0" src="http://www.veotag.com/player/?pid=7241eba9-0639-4bb7-be0e-470564837f7e&amp;amp;mode=embedded&amp;amp;autostart=0" height="464" width="429"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/72206-80605/Media/ON24%20Podcast.mp3"&gt;Link to Original Audio Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BuzzMarketingForTechnology"&gt;Signup for this Podcast Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Stuart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuart Bowen, Senior Director of Virtual Events, ON24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his current position, Stuart overseas the Sales and Business Development of ON24 Virtual Show, working with Sales, Executive Management and Product Development.

In business publications, online, radio, even TV? For B2B marketers this can be quite a quandary. But thanks to B2B Magazine – they have compiled a list of the Top 100 B2B advertisers and how much they are spending on each.  (&lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/pdfs/Top100.pdf"&gt;link to full report&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can that help you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how much the big boys spend on their media and the distribution of that media doesn’t really help me right now in budget season. But knowing how much they spend as a percent of their overall revenue can. Let me explain …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IDC coined a term – Marketing Budget Ratio – which is the percentage of marketing budget to overall revenues (also known as MBR). The MBR for most technology software and hardware firms (according to IDC) is typically 3-5%. In technology pure play services firms you typically see 1.5% (according to ITSMA) or even lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have adapted that idea to create the Media Budget Ratio. This is the percentage of media spend to overall revenue. I took the B2B Magazine report and pulled out some data points. I chose IBM, Cisco and Accenture to match their media spend against their 2007 revenues. What I found was actually quite interesting (see chart below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SOoTSCir4fI/AAAAAAAAARU/XZ1L1bvBmYA/s1600-h/Media-Budget-Ratio.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SOoTSCir4fI/AAAAAAAAARU/XZ1L1bvBmYA/s400/Media-Budget-Ratio.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5254033115922031090" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it looks like is these few top B2B firms are spending about .2% of their revenues on pure media (note: no costs of marketing staff, marketing programs, field marketing, PR or ad production are included in these cost). You realize pretty quickly that there is great efficiency that large firms have when branding with traditional media. Take IBM at $195M – more than enough money to spend online, in airports, on TV etc. Accenture reportedly spends $60 just to promote the Tiger relationship that you see everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if you are only in the single Billions of dollars in total revenue? Perhaps with a $2-4Million dollar media spend - you might find it hard to compete with the big boys (which is frankly how I feel in my role). To me this chart while depressing is yet another wake up call for marketers to move aggressively into Social Media – where your customers and prospects can amplify your message for you!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/7411225476386922987/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=7411225476386922987' title='12 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7411225476386922987'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7411225476386922987'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/10/media-budget-ratio-how-much-should-b2b.html' title='Media Budget Ratio: How much should B2B companies spend on Media?'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SOoTSCir4fI/AAAAAAAAARU/XZ1L1bvBmYA/s72-c/Media-Budget-Ratio.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-3936029282901685332</id><published>2008-10-01T09:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-01T09:50:35.963-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Content Marketing'/><title type='text'>Content IS your Brand</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SOOqHDauGrI/AAAAAAAAARM/8CHmZXDMGhY/s1600-h/Cog+in+the+Wheel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SOOqHDauGrI/AAAAAAAAARM/8CHmZXDMGhY/s400/Cog+in+the+Wheel.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252228628597316274" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Because of Google – everyone today has access to research that we have never had before. So when you are considering a purchase what’s the first thing you do – Google it. Therefore shoppers (B2C) and buyers (B2B) are armed with more data than ever before and its going to get worse thanks to social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Web 1.0 we saw companies create websites as outposts of their companies and immediately everyone had to have one. But in today’s Web 2.0 world all you have now is your content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate hearing in the Web 1.0 world – content is King. But you know what? It came true. It’s been a game of whoever can create the most content wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is into thought leadership, custom content, podcasts, videocasts, community – which I think is great. And this hasn’t gone unnoticed – recent B2B Magazine article mentioned the top M&amp;amp;A target is a marketing company strong in integrating custom content and live events!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what? So that means the entire first experiences of your brand online are all around the quality of content you put out there AND what people have to say about it. It’s time to crank on the quality of your content machine not just the quantity!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/3936029282901685332/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=3936029282901685332' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/3936029282901685332'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/3936029282901685332'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/10/content-is-your-brand.html' title='Content IS your Brand'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SOOqHDauGrI/AAAAAAAAARM/8CHmZXDMGhY/s72-c/Cog+in+the+Wheel.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-5425802334282344099</id><published>2008-09-29T12:12:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-29T13:15:34.852-07:00</updated><title type='text'>LiveBar – Add Community to your Site in Seconds!</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;A live interview with the CEO, Peter Friedman, from &lt;a href="http://www.liveworld.com/"&gt;LiveWorld&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.web20expo.com/"&gt;Web 2.0 Expo&lt;/a&gt; about the launch of their new product called LiveBar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever dreamed of adding community to your website without having the hassle of a major integration effort involving your IT department then LiveWorld’s newest product called LiveBar is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LiveBar adds contextually relevant community to your site by adding a single line of Java script to your header tag just to those pages which adds community to those pages in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve got a site with lots of content, it probably doesn’t make sense to have community features on every page. But, it does make sense to add real-time conversation to sections with high traffic volume—for example, content areas about a current program, or hot topics. Using LiveBar, you can add conversational elements like comments and “shouts”  (which are similar to Tweets) to just those sections, and enhance the experience for those users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A&amp;amp;E, QVC, Tulane University are already pilot clients for LiveBar and other existing customers include – Neutrogena, P&amp;amp;G, American Express, Kimberly-Clark HSBC, Kraft, Campbells and more …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to Peter Friedman discuss how to do this and the best uses of this for your brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe border="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://www.veotag.com/player/?pid=8aca5d5c-f106-4472-8ac0-f2a33f3c8655&amp;amp;mode=embedded&amp;amp;autostart=0" scrolling="no" width="429" frameborder="0" height="464"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/72206-80605/Media/LiveWorld%20FINAL.mp3"&gt;Link to Original Audio Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BuzzMarketingForTechnology"&gt;Signup for this Podcast Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Peter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter founded LiveWorld, Inc. in April 1996.

Then you quickly realize that not every problem is a crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you identify the crisis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well studying the facts helps (laugh) – the best way to identify a crisis is to get the best analysis – sometimes you can skate across the surface of issues but sometimes you need to drop into the entrails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the role of communication today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today that is incredibly important – if you can’t communicate properly then game over – and it happens faster than ever before – if you can’t sum it up in 20 seconds then you may not get your point across – you don’t always have the luxury in this media environment of being able to explain yourself in a long winded debate – that’s a real issue for politicians these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the Top things you would do if you were coming into office in the US?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well clearly I would focus on the current economic crisis, terrorism, environment/energy, fixing healthcare and need for a strong strategic relationship with China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be your policies on World Terror?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 9/11 the biggest thing that I have learned is the complexity of this issue and the depth of the roots that this issue has. Military means are not the only means – we have to win the battle of ideas as well as the battle of arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about energy and the environment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there will be a renewed emphasis on nuclear power – I think there will be big investments in renewable energy – but what really needs to happen is the creation of a global framework on climate change this is very difficult and very complex. There has to be a deal that has America and China in it – otherwise it won’t work. My advice is to actually do the basic brokering with the G8 + China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa - those countries form 75 % of all emissions – you will never get a deal with 192 countries around the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s your advice to our leaders in the audience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single most difficult thing about leadership is doing what you think is right even though it may not be the popular thing. Someone has to take responsibility on their shoulders. You can’t please all the people all of the time – in the end if you are in a position of leadership – what you owe the people you are leading is - the truth as you see it and the decisions that you think are right based on the data that you have.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/86202296468940355/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=86202296468940355' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/86202296468940355'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/86202296468940355'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/09/challenge-of-change.html' title='The Challenge of Change'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNvKwa4lAlI/AAAAAAAAARE/WjhbPAPEEMU/s72-c/tony+blair.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-5071561851748094355</id><published>2008-09-25T06:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-25T06:43:10.005-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Economy'/><title type='text'>Best of Times and the Worst of Times</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNuM2ztuaCI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/1AmoAujw0E8/s1600-h/jack_welch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNuM2ztuaCI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/1AmoAujw0E8/s400/jack_welch.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5249944663853262882" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Jack Welch former CEO of GE’s Q&amp;amp;A at the &lt;a href="http://www.wbfny.com/"&gt;World Business Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What going on with the economy today and who is at fault?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One crowd is these damn investment bankers - when these investment banking firms went public they were playing with others people money – before they were playing with the partners’ money. To let people without accountability make money where the only penalty was a cut in their bonus not in their head is wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much does leadership or lack of leadership have to do with this crisis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These leaders did everything for yield – which caused all these complicated products come into play that they didn’t even understand. I owned Kidder Peabody for only 4 days when these investment bankers came into my office and wanted to do a $400 million dollar deal – I almost lost my teeth – we were in over our heads so we sold it. Look, if you don’t understand what it is - don’t buy it! And if the earnings are too good to be true – it’s NOT! But the failure has to be with the leadership since their bonuses were tied to all of this. We have to get leadership compensation tied to shareholder value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it change capitalism here in the US?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes but for like this long (very short finger spread). But we are in for one hell of a tough quarter and first quarter next year – some real negative growth. So my advice is to get your cost structure in place and be sure you are not over leveraged. And be sure to take care of your best people – take care of your stars, the top 20-30%. You don’t want to dump your soldiers in a time like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has been the biggest change since you left GE, seven years ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Globalization for sure – China is huge threat and also a huge opportunity – we have to be the most competitive skill based economy out there – Also the information age is faster and more prevalent – how many attendees have a slower more easy going job today? None right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what should a leader do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to articulate a vision to get through this time – you can’t over communicate in this time. You have to be in front of them, anyone can run the railroad when it is going straight – if you got capital - put it to work – bury your competition or buy them. Go on the offense – look at your competitors and the landscape. Also you gotta think about how you can use credit terms to keep your customers alive – this is the best times but also the worst times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does corporate social responsibility mean to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word - Winning – create jobs and make money then you give it back. If you don’t win - you have nothing to give back. All this Corporate Social Responsibility is all backassward you have to win first then give back. It all starts with winning!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/5071561851748094355/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=5071561851748094355' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/5071561851748094355'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/5071561851748094355'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/09/best-of-times-and-worst-of-times.html' title='Best of Times and the Worst of Times'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNuM2ztuaCI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/1AmoAujw0E8/s72-c/jack_welch.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-721755930809643099</id><published>2008-09-24T12:40:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-24T12:41:59.577-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Leadership'/><title type='text'>A Crisis is a Terrible Thing to Waste!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNqXrL0h5gI/AAAAAAAAAQs/33dZgmH1_ow/s1600-h/jim-collins.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNqXrL0h5gI/AAAAAAAAAQs/33dZgmH1_ow/s400/jim-collins.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5249675083817018882" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Jim Collins author of Built to Last and Good to Great’s speech at the &lt;a href="http://www.wbfny.com"&gt;World Business Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good is the mortal enemy of great – I been curious to understand what systematically makes companies great. We now have over 6000 years of corporate data to compare what’s different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single most important distinction is most companies are like twins in the same industry with the same resources but one makes a leap and becomes great! It can’t be the industry or circumstance – greatness is not a function of circumstance – it’s a matter of choice and discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was the best publicly traded stock for the 30 year period of 1972 to 2002 – Southwest airlines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does it take to be Southwest not Pacific Southwest airlines – which was in the same industry with the same resources and even a bigger opportunity. If there was anything this last week in the stock market should teach us is that we should be very paranoid about our firms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather you prevail or fail – depends more on what you do to yourself then what the world does to you. You can’t come back from death but you can come back from a near death experience – IBM, Cisco, etc used decline as a catalyst to make a comeback – a crisis is a terrible thing to waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Great Companies didn’t go out and get a new CEO on board who set a new vision a new direction and then motivates everyone to go in that direction. In fact the Great Company got leaders who admitted that they didn’t know where to go and what to do. They first got the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus. It’s first who then what – who is the head of strategy who is the head of tactics etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the percentage of key seats on your bus being filled with the right people? It’s like an SAT score or a cholesterol test – if it is trending down your company is getting sicker and you have a problem if it is trending up you are getting more healthy. If you have the right people on the bus they tend to be self motivated to make a difference. And they are the ones that can carry you through a crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 to-do’s&lt;br /&gt;1)    Try the Good to Great diagnostic tool – and sit down with your team and assess yourself&lt;br /&gt;2)    Be able to answer how many key seats are open on your bus and what is your plan to fill them&lt;br /&gt;3)    Get young people in your face&lt;br /&gt;4)    Build a council that does not judge&lt;br /&gt;5)    What is your question to statement relationship and can you double it?&lt;br /&gt;6)    Turn off your electronic devices – take time to think&lt;br /&gt;7)    Start a "Stop Doing" List&lt;br /&gt;8)    Ask everyone on your team to talk in terms of what are they ultimately responsible for&lt;br /&gt;9)    Get your core values solid period&lt;br /&gt;10)    Set out a 15-20 year Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) and identify what obstacles might get in your way and start removing them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He challenged us with one parting thought – now that you have listened to this - go out and make yourself useful!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/721755930809643099/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=721755930809643099' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/721755930809643099'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/721755930809643099'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/09/crisis-is-terrible-thing-to-waste.html' title='A Crisis is a Terrible Thing to Waste!'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNqXrL0h5gI/AAAAAAAAAQs/33dZgmH1_ow/s72-c/jim-collins.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25162405.post-7375428454359620594</id><published>2008-09-24T08:01:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-24T08:03:37.045-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Economy'/><title type='text'>It’s the Economy, Stupid!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNpWgCeGx5I/AAAAAAAAAQk/x-snMIaNPyA/s1600-h/Rudy-Giuliani.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNpWgCeGx5I/AAAAAAAAAQk/x-snMIaNPyA/s400/Rudy-Giuliani.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5249603424072681362" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Rudy Giuliani former 107th mayor of New York’s Q&amp;amp;A at &lt;a href="http://www.wbfny.com"&gt;World Business Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is NYC doing today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s doing wonderful – crime remains the lowest in the country, its clean, it’s a place that you either love or hate. It’s going through real difficulty lately since the Yankees aren’t in the playoffs – oh you thought I was going to say something about Wall Street. (Laugh) Well Wall Street is home town industry, like steel was to Pittsburgh, 40% of the tax revenues are affected by Wall Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the $700 billion bailout plan the right for America?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the concept is the right idea – IF the crisis is not that bad then it will make the money back so the sooner we act the cheaper it will be – if we dawdle the price will be much higher. What you need to focus on is you are not bailing out specific companies, you are bailing out an economy. You can see it in NYC – if Wall Street has a bad year – people who deliver food and run the transportation are going to be out of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What went wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of capital these firms had set aside as per the capital allocations weren’t enough – what they don’t need is more regulations – they are drowning in regulations – these are heavily regulated industries. This bailout should be accompanied by reform – not just cash! And how about we actually understand the deals we are doing! I guarantee you, some of the people at the top of these organizations didn’t fully understand the nature of these deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How are we going to pay for this $700 billion dollar bailout?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hope is that the growth of the economy will pay for this – not the taxpayer – if it works – it will pay for itself with 2-3% growth – worst case more is needed which is then where the taxpayer need to pay for this. My hope is we don’t go overboard with over-regulation we saw with Enron. The worst thing we can do is over-regulate which will hurt our competitiveness internationally.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/feeds/7375428454359620594/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25162405&amp;postID=7375428454359620594' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7375428454359620594'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25162405/posts/default/7375428454359620594'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://buzzmarketingfortech.blogspot.com/2008/09/its-economy-stupid.html' title='It’s the Economy, Stupid!'/><author><name>Paul Dunay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07018961389385248142</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l6h7gwxUGoM/SNpWgCeGx5I/AAAAAAAAAQk/x-snMIaNPyA/s72-c/Rudy-Giuliani.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
