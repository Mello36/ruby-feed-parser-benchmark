<title><![CDATA[W@W!!!  Rooms for Rent in Amazing Victorian Mansion!! (Historic York) $650]]></title>
<link>http://york.craigslist.org/apa/953807003.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[This amazing mansion was recently featured on national television for its rich history and luxurious charm. Now, we're opening this luxury mansion to you! <br>
Rooms and suites, furnished and unfurnished, long-term and short, are available in this historic mansion on South Beaver Street in the historic district of downtown York, Pennsylvania. <br>
<br>
Walking distance from the historic market, visitors' center, historic theaters, museums, new baseball stadium, shops, office and government buildings, the college, rail trail, park, pubs and clubs, free concerts at Cherry Lane, even the Articles of Confederation – in the center of it all. <br>
<br>
Living in luxury can be more affordable than you think. Nightly rates rival those of corporate hotels, but what you find here is much more impressive than anything you'll find at your average hotel. <br>
<br>
There are a number of options available. Rent a room, 2-bedroom suite, or 3-bedroom suite, complete with antique furniture and decorations. There's also a downstairs office or bedroom with a separate entrance in a commercially zoned area. <br>
<br>
Utilities -- gas, electric, and water -- are included in the rent prices.  We also offer wireless Internet and cable.  And living in living in historic luxury like this is more affordable than you may think. <br>
<br>
All guests are granted shared access to formal dining room, large eat-in kitchen, and the elaborately decorated parlor -- as well as laundry and storage facilities in the three-room basement. <br>
<br>
The house will impress your friends, family, and visitors. It was featured on the program "If Walls Could Talk" on HGTV on Christmas Eve.  It has been the location for film and photo shoots, is on the York Historic Walking Tour, was part of York's Home & Garden Tour, and is on the National Register of Historic Places.  <br>
 <br>
The woodwork, hand plastered medallions and molding, herringbone, inlaid floors, stained glass windows, family crests, gold-plated, hand-crafted Pier mirrors, antique chandeliers and light fixtures, gasolier, 12-foot ceilings, 9-foot tall windows, curved walls, and elaborate decorations will amaze you. <br>
<br>
Short-term stays are fine. This was once a successful Bed & Breakfast, so it's well suited for shorter stays.  We specialize in serving professionals who are relocating, have temporary assignments, or need a furnished home away from home.<br>
<br>
The formal parlor is perfect for events as well: readings, meetings, receptions, gatherings, you name it. <br>
<br>
Email us for more details. Rooms are available NOW -- whether you want to stay for one year or one night. <br>
<br>
See the beautiful pictures and read about the rich history at www.yorkinn.blogspot.com. <br>
<br>
Email us to set up a tour, reserve a room or suite, or ask questions. We look forward to personally welcoming you to the Historic York Inn.<br>

<title><![CDATA[Downtown Gettysburg - Beautiful Apartment for rent (Gettysburg) $550 1bd]]></title>
<link>http://york.craigslist.org/apa/949507149.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[Room-mate wanted for beautiful new apartment in downtown Gettysburg. Apartment is fully furnished with all kitchen and laundry appliances as well as living room with TV. Bedroom is currently furnished but very flexible (can have furnished or not). Room has detached full private bathroom. As you can see from the pictures, the apartment has 12’ ceilings, hardwood floors, light wells, granite countertops, fully tiled bathrooms with granite sink tops and giant windows in the kitchen looking out over Rt.30. 
<br>

<br>
I am a young engineer working locally and would simply like someone nice and respectful to share the apartment with. Gender is not important but I would like either a college student or other young professional to share the space. I do have a 3 year old golden retriever that lives with me who is quiet and friendly. 
<br>

<br>
The sublet would be for a time period of 6 months starting January 1st with a price of $550/month. This covers all utilities as well as use of all kitchen appliances, washer and dryer. 
<br>

<br>
Contact information follows below, but there are a few items to note. 
<br>

<br>
If you do not fit the criteria above, cannot pay cash on the 1st of every month or have issues with anything I have mentioned, please do not contact me. It will be a waste of your time and mine. 
<br>

<br>

<description><![CDATA[This amazing mansion was recently featured on national television for its rich history and luxurious charm. Now, we're opening this luxury mansion to you! <br>
Rooms and suites, furnished and unfurnished, long-term and short, are available in this historic mansion on South Beaver Street in the historic district of downtown York, Pennsylvania. <br>
<br>
Walking distance from the historic market, visitors' center, historic theaters, museums, new baseball stadium, shops, office and government buildings, the college, rail trail, park, pubs and clubs, free concerts at Cherry Lane, even the Articles of Confederation – in the center of it all. <br>
<br>
Living in luxury can be more affordable than you think. Nightly rates rival those of corporate hotels, but what you find here is much more impressive than anything you'll find at your average hotel. <br>
<br>
There are a number of options available. Rent a room, 2-bedroom suite, or 3-bedroom suite, complete with antique furniture and decorations. There's also a downstairs office or bedroom with a separate entrance in a commercially zoned area. <br>
<br>
Utilities -- gas, electric, and water -- are included in the rent prices.  We also offer wireless Internet and cable.  And living in living in historic luxury like this is more affordable than you may think. <br>
<br>
All guests are granted shared access to formal dining room, large eat-in kitchen, and the elaborately decorated parlor -- as well as laundry and storage facilities in the three-room basement. <br>
<br>
The house will impress your friends, family, and visitors. It was featured on the program "If Walls Could Talk" on HGTV on Christmas Eve.  It has been the location for film and photo shoots, is on the York Historic Walking Tour, was part of York's Home & Garden Tour, and is on the National Register of Historic Places.  <br>
 <br>
The woodwork, hand plastered medallions and molding, herringbone, inlaid floors, stained glass windows, family crests, gold-plated, hand-crafted Pier mirrors, antique chandeliers and light fixtures, gasolier, 12-foot ceilings, 9-foot tall windows, curved walls, and elaborate decorations will amaze you. <br>
<br>
Short-term stays are fine. This was once a successful Bed & Breakfast, so it's well suited for shorter stays.  We specialize in serving professionals who are relocating, have temporary assignments, or need a furnished home away from home.<br>
<br>
The formal parlor is perfect for events as well: readings, meetings, receptions, gatherings, you name it. <br>
<br>
Email us for more details. Rooms are available NOW -- whether you want to stay for one year or one night. <br>
<br>
See the beautiful pictures and read about the rich history at www.yorkinn.blogspot.com. <br>
<br>
Email us to set up a tour, reserve a room or suite, or ask questions. We look forward to personally welcoming you to the Historic York Inn.<br>
