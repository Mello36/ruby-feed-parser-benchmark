			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://arts-united.com/UserFiles/Image/logo_176_95.jpg" alt="" /> Some updates (long overdue, I know). I had a series of personal issues with which to deal. They aren&#8217;t of the recurring variety, so, henceforth; nothing will come between me and the vision, mission, and implementation of Arts United.</p>
<p><a href="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/orange_cube.png" rel="lightbox[82]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-83 alignleft" title="orange_cube" src="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/orange_cube.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" /></a> The transfer from the arts-united<strong>.com</strong> domain to the arts-united<strong>.org</strong> domain has been completed. The arts-united<strong>.com</strong> domain will be used to host sites for artists, galleries, and educators.</p>
<p><a href="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/green_cube.png" rel="lightbox[82]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-84" title="green_cube" src="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/green_cube.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" /></a> We are still <a title="Forum entry - opens new window" href="http://forums.arts-united.com/index.php?topic=6.0" target="_blank">searching for help</a> from anyone who is willing and able to commit the time and the passion to the cause. We are also interviewing for key positions on the Board of Directors. You are free to <a title="Contact Page" href="http://arts-united.org/contact/">contact me</a> via any method listed on the &#8216;<strong>Contact</strong>&#8216; page listed in the top menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/blue_cube.png" rel="lightbox[82]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-86" title="blue_cube" src="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/blue_cube.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" /></a> We will launch our first community project within a month. Check back for details!</p>
<p><a href="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/red_cube.png" rel="lightbox[82]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-87" title="red_cube" src="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/red_cube.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" /></a> The services that Arts United will provide will be announced within 2 weeks. If you are someone who appreciates art, an artist, a gallery or venue, or an educator <em>you need</em> to be a part of this organization. <strong>Register </strong>for the site at the lower right corner of this page and <a title="Register for forums" href="http://forums.arts-united.com/" target="_blank"><strong>register</strong> for the forums</a> as well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Oh yeah, I am aware that both of the calendars aren&#8217;t functional</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><sup>fixed!</sup></span>. I am in the process of setting up a full development site so you don&#8217;t have to witness the e-ugliness of the site in progress. I did, however; add a <a title="Events Calendar" href="http://arts-united.org/events/">full page <strong>Events!</strong> Calendar</a> (look up<a href="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/up.gif" rel="lightbox[82]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-99" title="up" src="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/up.gif" alt="" width="30" height="30" /></a>to the menu at the top of the page). If you are an artist, a gallery/venue, or an educator with upcoming events, email the information to me. The <strong>Events!</strong> Calendar will be a collective of all events in the area. One stop shopping.</p>
<p>Do Art.</p>
