			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world was shocked today by a violent tragedy: a <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Mumbai_Terrorist_Attacks">coordinated terrorist attack in Mumbai</a> against several sites, including a <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Cafe_Leopold_Attack">restaurant</a>, a <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus_Attack">railway station</a> and two luxury hotels. The Indian city was under siege for several hours, and all major news organizations picked up on this story within about two hours of the first explosions.</p>
<p>The first reported incidents were of <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Hotel_Oberoi_Attack">explosions at the Oberoi Hotel</a> and at the five-star <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Taj_Mahal_Palace_Hotel_Attack">Taj Mahal Palace Hotel</a>. As the story progressed, reports began to emerge of hostage situations and terrorists repeatedly setting off explosions and throwing grenades out of the hotel windows.</p>
<p>Several Mumbai citizens caught in the midst of these incidents began to report what they saw through their mobile phones, most notably <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Mumbai_Terrorist_Attack_Twitter">using the social networking service Twitter</a>. User <a href="http://twitter.com/puneet">Puneet</a> tweeted all the latest developments through his twitter microblog.</p>
<p>As the night progressed, more details emerged. The authorities now say that 85 people are confirmed dead and approximately 200 more were injured. The targets were apparently American and British diplomats and tourists, as the attacks occurred strategically in areas frequented by foreigners, though many witnesses say that the attackers fired their AK-47s at anyone in sight. A previously unknown group calling itself <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Deccan_Mujahideen">Deccan Mujahideen</a> claimed responsibility for the attacks, though news organizations suggested that this may be a front for <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Lashkar-e-Taiba">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>, a group that many nations have listed as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>A number of decorated Indian anti-terror and police officers were killed in this attack, including <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Vijay_Salaskar">Vijay Salaskar</a>, <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Hemant_Karkare">Hemant Karkare</a> and <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Ashok_Kamte">Ashok Kamte</a>.</p>
<p>For continuing coverage and new developments of this tragic story, see <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Category:Mumbai_Terror_Attack">Mahalo&#8217;s Mumbai Terror Attack category</a>. We will be updating these pages consistently in the days and weeks to come and will continue to present the most accurate and trustworthy information available.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice Presidential candidates Sarah Palin and Joe Biden <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Biden_Palin_Debate">went toe to toe</a> on Thursday October 2, 2008, in their first and only debate before the general election in November. The two sparred on foreign policy, the economy and other tangential topics like gay marriage and Iraq.</p>
<p>Though a <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/VP_Debate_Polls">CNN/Opinion Research poll shows Biden as the winner</a> by a small margin, there were few fireworks during the debate and neither candidate landed a decisive blow. The poll also showed that Palin performed better than expected, especially in light of her recent fumbles in the press. Palin went as far as to say that <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Sarah_Palin_Annoyed">Couric &#8220;annoyed&#8221; her</a> with her quizzy questions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Steve_Fossett_Remains">Remains of adventurer Steve Fossett were finally found</a> on October 2, 2008, amongst his plain&#8217;s wreckage in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. DNA tests are pending, but Fossett is thought to be dead. He first went missing in September 2007.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/House_Bailout_Vote">approved (263-171) the $700 billion bailout bill </a>today, after initially rejecting the bill on September 29. The bill gives the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson free reign to purchase flailing financial institutions, in what is being dubbed the biggest act of governmental intervention on record. According to an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/03/MNR813AHDN.DTL">article on SFGate.com</a>, the bill was repackaged to include billions in earmarks and tax breaks for home-town interests in the Senate, two examples being: $2 million for wooden arrow manufacturers in Oregon, and the extension of a tax break worth $478 million for Hollywood filmmakers who shoot in the U.S.</p>
<p>In somewhat lighter news,  a user with the handle <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Steve_Jobs_Heart_Attack_Hoax">&#8220;johntw&#8221; purported a hoax through CNN&#8217;S iReport system that Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple) had a heart attack</a>. This caused Apple&#8217;s stock to temporarily plummet, falling below $100 per share. Apple&#8217;s stock has recovered, and Steve Jobs is fine.</p>
<p>Need some games to dig into over the weekend? <em>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</em>, the action-adventure title that lets you violently wield the force, has <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3170118">broken sales records</a> and <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/starwarstheforceunleashed?q=star%20wars%20the%20force%20unleashed">defied reviews</a> (check out our full <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Star_Wars_The_Force_Unleashed_Walkthrough">game guide</a>). Or, if you would like to be terrified, <em>Silent Hill: Homecoming</em>, the fifth title in the chilling <em>Silent Hill</em> series, was released this past week (<a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Silent_Hill_Homecoming_Walkthrough">game guide</a> is pending).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the first day of October, and the U.S. <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Senate_Bailout_Vote">Senate passed the $700 billion bailout bill</a>, 75 to 25. The House, which voted 228 to 205 against the <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008">measure</a>, is expected to reconsider it tomorrow. </p>
<p>Although adventurer Steve Fossett was declared dead in February 2008, following a September 2007 Nevada desert plane crash, his body was never found, and <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Steve_Fossett_Hoax">rumors of his faking his own death</a> continue to this day. Now the plot thickens&#8211;a hiker in California has allegedly found three <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Steve_Fossett_ID">IDs with Fossett&#8217;s name</a>, as well as $1,000 cash. Police are investigating the documents&#8217; validity. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Biden_Palin_Debate">debate between vice-presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sarah Palin</a> is hotly anticipated for tomorrow, and <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Gwen_Ifill_Broken_Ankle">Gwen Ifill won&#8217;t let her broken ankle</a> keep her from moderating. </p>
<p>Could <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Jessica_Simpson_Tony_Romo_Engaged">Jessica Simpson and Tony Romo be engaged</a>? The two were reportedly seen ring-shopping in Dallas. </p>
<p>Attention <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Phish_Reunion">Phish fans: reunion</a> shows will be held on March 6, 7, and 8, 2009, and tickets are now available!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A turbulent third financial quarter comes to a close, with the Dow surging up 485 points after a <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Dow_Drops_777">record 777-point drop</a> the day before. After voting down the bill on Monday, a reconvened <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Senate_Bailout_Vote">Senate will vote on the bailout</a> again on Wednesday morning, with affirmative votes more likely.</p>
<p>As both candidates face tough questions in the month before the election, Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin seems to be under the most heat, with the fourth part of her <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Sarah_Palin_Katie_Couric">interview with Katie Couric</a> airing today. In one of the more tense moments of the interview, Couric asks <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Sarah_Palin_News_Sources">Palin which news sources</a> she would read before being selected as the running mate; Palin generalized, but did not list any specific sources. Her <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Biden_Palin_Debate">debate against Joe Biden</a>, Barack Obama&#8217;s Democratic running mate, is Thursday night in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
<p>In lighter news, <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Charlie_Ebersol">Charlie Ebersol</a>, son of NBC Sports producer Dick Ebersol, is dating tennis star Maria Sharapova. Ready to rock, country style? <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Kevin_Costner_Debut_Album">Kevin Costner&#8217;s debut album</a> will be released on November 11. His band&#8217;s name is Modern West.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enterprising University of Alaska Southeast student <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Richard_Millay">Richard Millay</a> found, and shared, a <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Sarah_Palin_Swimsuit_Video">video of Sarah Palin competing in the swimsuit</a> portion of the Miss Alaska pageant. Soon we may be able to see video of <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Sarah_Palin_Flute">Sarah Palin playing the flute</a> in the talent competition, as well.</p>
<p>John McCain did decide to go on with <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/University_of_Mississippi_Debate">tonight&#8217;s debate</a>. However, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> decided to go one step further: several hours before the debate, the publication&#8217;s online site displayed a McCain ad that stated &#8220;<a href="http://www.mahalo.com/McCain_Wins_Debate">McCain Wins Debate</a>!&#8221; </p>
<p>If the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has a crystal ball, it would perhaps have been better served to check out where the U.S. economy was heading.
