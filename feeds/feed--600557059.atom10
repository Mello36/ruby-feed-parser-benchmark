		<content type="html" xml:base="http://boxofwhine.com/2008/12/10/jingle-bell-5k/"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I said I would give it a shot and I did so.  Last Saturday, starting at the high school track, through the praking lot, down through the Spirit trail, down &#8220;R&#8221; street, a couple twists and turn then back down River Road, back down the track and, 3.2 miles late, through the finishline in under thirty minutes at 29:19. </p>
<p><a href="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/finishline.jpg" rel="lightbox[462]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-463 alignleft" title="finishline" src="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/finishline-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Previous to the beginning of the race, I picked someone who I was going to try and beat.  I found the one guy who I thought would be no problem.  Sadly, reality set in when I was huffing and puffing toward the high school finish line, and my target (number 51) finishing his cup of hot cocoa in the parkinglot. </p>
<p>I had dreaded throughout the whole run that I was going to be the last runner to cross the finishline. As I&#8217;m heading down the last quarter-mile on River Road, I notice one person who was slowly making a bid to upset my position.  Once I crossed the finishline, I had made up some distance from my chaser.  I totally out ran that elderly woman.  To ease my fears, I was actually far from last and equally far from first.  There were at least fifteen people who ran in after me.  Thankfully, none of the 5k walkers finished before nor near me.</p>
<p>I was glad to be able to run this 5k, I would definitely run another one.  One of th<a href="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/megarret.jpg" rel="lightbox[462]"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-464" title="megarret" src="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/megarret-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>e best parts was that I got to run with a buddy of mine, Garrett.  We pushed each other to both join up and then tried to recruit others to join up.  We were the solid ones, we stuck to our word and finished the race, although Garrett had finshed ahead of me.  He got close to our goal of running the 5k in 27 minutes.  Garrett was a lot closer than I was, through our first mile we kept our pace, running a 8:53.  I had to slow down after that, I realized that my competitive nature was overpowering my pace and could have made the run a lot harder on myself than it had to be; so I scaled back and kept my pace&#8230; which helped make successful.</p>
<p>What did I learn.  Well, I learned there is a lot I can do that I assumed I would never have.  If you had suggested a year ago that I could run, let alone finish a 5k, I would have been severely skeptical.  But yet, here I am, having finished my first race and looking forward to others.  Maybe, if I&#8217;m lucky, the next one will be in a faster pace, but if not, so what&#8230; at least I did it.  And even that is an improvement.</p>

<p>As much as I would have love to have one, I didn&#8217;t have a witty comeback.  There is a real sense in shame when you have to take off your sweater during class, turn it around and put it back on.</p>
<p>When I get home tonight, I&#8217;ll practice the skill that most five year-olds have mastered.</p>
<p>Bravo.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://boxofwhine.com/2008/12/05/flickr-meme/"><![CDATA[<p>Saw this on CatharticInk, thought I could do it too.  Rules as follows: <em>Go to the sixth page of your Flickr photostream and post the sixth picture on that page.</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s mine:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Europe 2008 778" href="http://boxofwhine.com/photo-album/photo/2693513904/europe-2008-778.html"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2693513904_fa0398d340.jpg" alt="Europe 2008 778" width="462" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>I took this picture in Switzerland, on our way down Mt. Pilatus.  We had just enjoyed a great lunch of bread, dried fruits, cheese, and various meats&#8230; not to mention a nice bottle of Bordeaux, all of which were picked up from the street vendors along the river in Luzern.  <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Europe 2008 767" href="http://boxofwhine.com/photo-album/photo/2692689777/europe-2008-767.html"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2692689777_9740ac1225_m.jpg" alt="Europe 2008 767" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>Before lunch, each of us took a ride down the summer toboggan run.  On the path down Mt. Pilatus, there were many different herds of cows, sheep and goats.  These were two of the most friendly of the herds.  We had been able to hear the baritone clanking of their bells from the highest point of the mountain.  Even though the fog allowed for only twenty feet of visibility, their sound could be heard for miles around.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Europe 2008 721" href="http://boxofwhine.com/photo-album/photo/2693501856/europe-2008-721.html"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3135/2693501856_e5194e24ef_m.jpg" alt="Europe 2008 721" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>As noisy as they were, they were also unafraid of us, obviously these cows were handled a lot because as we approached, they barely lifted their heads to acknowledge our presence.  When we would pet them and scratch their necks, only then did they take notice.   This was especially true for the cow in the foreground, she stuck out her head and pushed out her tongue out as far she could because Jess had found the spot on the bottom side of her neck, right near her bell which needed the most scratching.</p>
<p>Eventually, the cows did get tired of us hanging about and decided to slowly saunter off to somewhere that had less us, which was perfectly timed for us to move on our own way down the mountain.  Through the steep grade down the mountain, into the individual little hillside farms and hay fields,  underneath the orchards and past the very friendly farmers up in their trees waving and saying something that was beyond my German.  Hopefully it was welcoming because he didn&#8217;t seem to mind us there.  Down we went, into the gentler hills, onto the cobbled lanes outside of town, across the little bridge that crossed the stream, behind the brown and grey stone houses and into the middle of the village to catch our train home.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://boxofwhine.com/2008/12/03/multi-ball/"><![CDATA[<p>I thought that I would make use of this post and get a couple of different things into it.</p>
<p>First off, here is a picture that was captured at one of our home games, I&#8217;m assuming it was earlier in the football season as it was starting to get dark earlier at the later part of the season.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that was taken when I was running over to the whole team with the linemen after their group warm ups:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/wells-coaching-small.jpg" rel="lightbox[432]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-433 aligncenter" title="wells-coaching-small" src="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/wells-coaching-small-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>Second item on the agenda; I&#8217;ve decided to run a 5k this Saturday.  I&#8217;ve been running pretty regularly for the past couple of weeks.  The race is call the Jingle Bell run which is put together to help support the Cottage Grove Jog Club as well as a charity here in town.  Believe me, I have no intention or want to (nor believe that I could) win the race.  I&#8217;m looking for a steady pace and a finish.</p>
<p>Emphasis on the finish.  Luckily, I&#8217;ll be running with at least two other teachers from the high school.  Their pace is little faster than my natural gait but I can easily keep up, hopefully keep enough energy for a kick at the end.  I&#8217;ll post the results here.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;ve been running consistently, three miles here, four miles at other times.  I&#8217;ve ran with Jess, my mom and co-workers&#8230; and I haven&#8217;t had a bad run yet, even though I have had to scare away a couple of dogs.  As for today&#8217;s run, I couldn&#8217;t find a partner so I ventured off on my own, which was a first.   I was worried that I would lose my motivation to keep a pace and finish without stopping if I didn&#8217;t have others to pace me or compete against.  But I was wrong, I plowed through nearly four miles.  Here&#8217;s a Google Map view of today&#8217;s run:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/12-3-2008-run-route.jpg" rel="lightbox[432]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-438 aligncenter" title="12-3-2008-run-route" src="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/12-3-2008-run-route-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>My buddy <a href="http://knutson3.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ricky</a>, who is the long-distance coach for the track team, sent me a wonderful site that has helped me map out my routes and tracking what I have done.  You can find a link <a href="http://www.usatf.org/routes/map/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Using Google Maps, it allows me to click out my path, giving me mileage counts and even elevation.  As well, I can save my routes for later use or look up other saved routes to give me a variety of runs.</p>
<p>Ricky also gave me an immense spread sheet that charts absolutely everything.  Mileage, Year-to-Date mileage, Life-to-Date Mileage, average pace, heart rate, how far I&#8217;ve ran in a particular pair of shoes and even tracking my progress to the moon or around the world.  Twenty-eight miles down.  Hopefully, I will be diligent and keep track of my progress.</p>
<p>To help me do so, even when I&#8217;m away from my spreadsheet I&#8217;ve added the WPss plugin to Box of Whine.  This allows me to intergrate spreadsheets into this site.  If you haven&#8217;t notice, there is a new section to the top of the post and to the side that says &#8220;Running Log&#8221;.  Here, you can see my progress, when I&#8217;ve done well, when I&#8217;ve slacked.  This is just a parred down version of Ricky&#8217;s spreadsheet, but nonetheless, it helps me track and I can add to it from any computer with internet access.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I have been fairly diligent on exercising.  By random chance, I&#8217;ve started running with a couple of teachers at the high school.  We usually run about three miles each time we run, which is between two and three times a week.  Granted, I&#8217;m not the fastest, but certainly keep up but most importantly I don&#8217;t stop.  In the past, even running a continious half mile seemed to be a great undertaking.  Every time I run, I definitely find &#8216;The Wall&#8217; (not a Pink Flyod reference) where mentally I have a hard time feeling that I can last the entire run, but then I give myself short goals: &#8220;make it to Harrison St.&#8221; or &#8220;Just back to the High School&#8221;.  These help, they are always within my sign and they have made it so I haven&#8217;t quit. </p>
<p>Even the boundires of my usual run of three miles gets pushed.  This weekend, my mom spent two days with us in the Grove.  On Sunday, she and I went for a run and ended up doing four miles and by the end of the run, I felt as though as I just did a light jog around the block. </p>
<p>On to the numbers&#8230; As of this morning, I am down to 236 pounds, wihch is an overall weight loss of 64 pounds.  I&#8217;m down 2 pant sizes and a shirt size.  Which is why we&#8217;ve spent a ridiculous amount of money refitting my wardorbe because I can&#8217;t walk around looking like I&#8217;m wearing garbage bags.  I&#8217;ve lost 21.3% of my original weight and I am 6 pounds shy of my inital goal.  That&#8217;s like I lost a fifth grader. </p>
<p>Everyday is a battle and choice, I just need to make sure I&#8217;m making the best of both of those.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/moose-beaver1.jpg" rel="lightbox[419]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-420 alignnone" title="moose-beaver1" src="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/moose-beaver1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, he is still prancing to and fro with it, placing it on his pillow and even setting it right next to his food dish when he eats&#8211;which is incredibly gross seeing as much as that dog drools and drops when he eats.  I had initially thought that the beaver wouldn&#8217;t make its debut until close to the civil war, but with those sorrowful brown eyes peeking up at me from underneath his cockeyed ear&#8230; how could I say no.  Plus, I&#8217;ll get some pre-civil war game pictures of a Great Dane mauling a beaver.   Christmas comes early:</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://boxofwhine.com/2008/11/10/house-fire-the-musical/"><![CDATA[<p>Am I wrong in assuming that most people, at least most of the time, have semi-normal dreams?  I&#8217;m not sure if it was because I had a relaxing day or what, but I had a freaky and ridiculous dream last night.</p>
<p>For some reason, my unconscious brain decided to reward me with a dream about having our house on fire.  Not just one house fire, but four separate house fires all in the same house.  Each time, the fire department would come, put the fire out&#8230; but lo&#8217; and behold, I would find another spot that was still on fire.  Then repeat that action three more times.  On the final house fire, I went to push down a while (isn&#8217;t that what you&#8217;re supposed to do if your house is on fire?) and as it&#8217;s falling down, I am either transported or my reality shifts and I&#8217;m in a musical.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t your run-of-the-mill musical, like Rent or Cats, no&#8230; this is a musical at a on skates.  Not ice skates, roller skates.  That&#8217;s how classy I am.  I don&#8217;t even give myself the cool inline skates, these are the circa 1980 big wheels and even bigger rubber front brake.  So now, after stressing over my house being on fire, I am now in a horrible, cheesy skating-musical with a touch of can-can where everyone is pushing down walls.  In the finale of the musical, the diva can-can musical girl tries to push down the last remaining wall, which instead of falling, turns into giant rotating technicolor dice that shine and spin as we skate down a ramp.</p>
<p>Luckily, my alarm went off and I had to wake up, I&#8217;m not sure I would like to where this dream would have led me next.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://boxofwhine.com/2008/11/05/happy-new-president-day/"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">First off, let me acknowledge that I realize that there are people who may read my blog who are not matched up with my politics, as it is their right.  What I post and write here is not meant to be offensive or demeaning just a smattering of myself.  That being said&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/obama_24x36_1a.jpg" rel="lightbox[407]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-408 alignnone" title="yes we can" src="http://boxofwhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/obama_24x36_1a-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">WHAT AN ELECTION NIGHT!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have always hated watching early results of an election, they always start off skewed.  When I watched Kerry/Gore, Kerry would start off with a lead in a state and then it would shift.  Last night was the opposite, thankfully.  Jess and I went over to the house of one of our friends to watch the results and have some good food (of both I did plenty).  The East Coast results were coming in as planned but when I started to be reassured was when Ohio turned blue.  This was reinforced by <a href="http://www.saturatedpratt.com" target="_blank">Pratt&#8217;s</a> text message saying that with the 207 electoral votes that Obama had, when the West Coast closes it is over.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And boy-howdy, was it over.  I was surprised how quickly the networks called the election for Obama.  I would have thought that they would string it out some more, lead us on a bit to boost up their ratings and their time to air ads.  I was wrong.  It wasn&#8217;t even a minute into eight o&#8217;clock that they had put the check mark onto Obama&#8217;s picture.  Wow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After a round of campaign and fireworks, Jess and I went home.  While she got ready for bed I listened to McCain&#8217;s concession speech and then Obama&#8217;s victory speech.  I thought John McCain was humble and honorable in his speech, even to the point where he was telling his supporters to stop booing at the mention of Obama&#8217;s name.  (Thank goodness <a href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/election08/106128/mccain_camp_shows_regret_on_palin,_her_request_to_speak_at_concession_%27vetoed%27/" target="_blank">they didn&#8217;t let Palin speak,</a> like she wanted to.)  The thought that got me was that if McCain had run a campaign based on principles like that, I think it would have been a much closer race.  Yet, he took the Roveian path of character assassination, mud-slinging, and avoidance of issues, which I think doomed his push for the White House.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Honestly (and even though I may take some grief for saying so), I don&#8217;t believe that the McCain that ran this campaign was the same McCain that ran eight years ago.  The person who I saw running again Bush had more Maverick leanings, was resolute on issues and ran a positive campaign even in the face of the outrageous and horrible things that were said about him.  But McCain sold out, he gave up what he appeared to be eight years ago for something that he thought the Republican base wanted&#8230; and he might have been right.  However, that&#8217;s not what the country wanted.  As cliche as it has become, the country did want change, almost to the point of a blood lust for change.  After the wrecking ball effect of this current administration, how could most people be happy with where we have ended up?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, this has been a remarkable experience.  Not only did I get to vote someone through the primary and then into the election (sorry Gore; sorry Kerry, I didn&#8217;t vote for you in the Primaries), but to see them win the presidency was astounding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This all goes back to when I was a kid.  I remember sitting in the kitchen watching Clinton win, but even more powerful, I remember being seven and my mom taking me to see Dukakis speak in Portland.  I remember her trying to hold me up so I could see but she could only do it for so long, a Dukakis supporter lifted me on to his shoulders.  As well, I have an equally distinct memory of the Bush Sr. supporter who was behind us, smoking his cigarette with anti-Dukakis sign, yelling out during the speech.  It came full circle when I took my mom to the Obama rally on the Waterfront in Portland.  To be a part of the movement, that energy&#8230; it is nice to see a dividend.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, Obama and his campaign has felt different than any of the others.  Never before have I felt so enthusiastic for a candidate.  As well, I have never been motivated to donate to a candidate, let alone three times.  I hope that Obama can hold up to my feelings and the apparent feelings of those who voted for him.  There is a lot of expectation for the new president and there are a lot of hardships awaiting his swearing in&#8230; a lot of things to correct.  I hope that President Obama makes me proud for my vote and disproves all of the slanderous claims he&#8217;s had to face, and I hope he continues to do so with class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also hope that he survives his stint as President.  I have a firm belief that there are lot of racist wackos and nuts out there who would fondly talk of assassination.  The numbers that scare me too, it only takes one of those wackos.  And this plays into my theory that Obama seems like another Kennedy (yes, I realize I wasn&#8217;t around when Kennedy was) in our midst.  His ideas, his way of speaking maybe this could be a Kennedy for my generation&#8230; hopefully without the shortened life and womanizing.  Even his wife, strong, well education, holds herself well seems like another Jackie Kennedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a pivotal point in our history, I&#8217;m excited to be firmly seated in front for the view.  What does it say to our nation and to the world that we as a nation can move past our horrid, intolerant, and bloody racial past.  Maybe we can reestablish good standing within the world, it will take time and effort but it could happen.  I hope that we have a movement of young people stirred to action for their country and their world, even if it is for assistance with college tuition, they will go out and work for the nation, doing positive and worthwhile actions.  Maybe we can move on past the harm and the mistrust between the differing cultures of people that live here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe I am naive; maybe I&#8217;ve been swept up and this is just yet another politician who will turn out to be another form of degenerate human leech to bleed the nation dry for his own political and financial gain.  I sure hope this isn&#8217;t the case and I don&#8217;t feel that it is&#8230; but still, feelings are easily wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have hope, I pray it materializes quickly.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">ps. Thank you for those of you Oregon voters who voted down both Education based Sizemore ballot measures.  I can&#8217;t tell you how scary the Merit pay measure was.  How would that have looked for me, as a special education teacher with students who have a documented disability, who have shown to not do well in relation to their peers&#8230; how would I have been handled.   Thanks again.</p>
