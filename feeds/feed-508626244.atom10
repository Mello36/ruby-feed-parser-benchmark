		<description>&lt;em&gt;"When I play with the band Tea Leaf Green, we have a song that's called Garden Part One, and Garden Part Two. But then on the sly I wrote a song called Garden Part Three and I never told them about it. This is probably the first time they're hearing it. I think they're here tonight."&lt;/em&gt; - Trevor 1-14-04</description>

		<description>&lt;em&gt;"That was a song called Pretty Jane. You know, I didn't write the lyric to that song. I found it on this old piece of sheet music, from around 1903 or something, by some guy named Wilbur or something. My grandma's name is Jane, and I thought it was cute."&lt;/em&gt;

		<title>Comment on Jackson Hole by Jackson Hole wiki</title>
		<link>http://www.dgold.info/green/song/jackson-hole/#comment-445</link>

		<description>Note that the town is often called "Jackson Hole" but it is really Jackson, Wyoming.  &lt;strong&gt;Jackson Hole is actually the whole valley of west-central Wyoming.&lt;/strong&gt; 

Historically, the name "hole" derives from language used by early trappers or mountain men, who entered the valley from the north and east and had to descend along relatively steep slopes, giving the feeling of entering a hole. The low valleys surrounded by mountains are criss-crossed by streams, the habitat of beaver and other fur-bearing animals.

		<description>Although I believe this is a stretch, this song reminds me of John Steinbeck's East of Eden. The character of Cathy, who could arguably represent the devil, sets fire to her home while her parents are inside, killing them both. She later goes on to become a whore, only to kill the mistress of the house and take over the business.

The character of Cathy, who could arguably represent the devil, sets fire to her home while her parents are inside, killing them both. She later goes on to become a whore, only to kill the mistress of the house and take over the business. Possibly a connection, although I think it&#8217;s just me enjoying the fact that this amazing song reminds me of my favorite book.</p>

		<description>So this is just a working title as Trevor did not specify a title when he played it at Tortugas. So I gave it this title. Sorry if it is wrong Trevor.

This song is powerful and the lyrics are some of his best yet. My particular favorite line is:

The daylight always fails me
There’s no secret he can keep
The midnight will embrace me
But she will not let me sleep</description>

		<description>I think this song speaks on two levels. Outside, it evokes the desire to leave life behind and travel. However, I believe there is a deeper message here. "Lets all ride together" could be a metaphor for peace. I read these lyrics as a calling to the people of the world to come together and realize the beauty of simplicity. ("Sleeping beneath the weeds.") The man in this story can see the opportunity of peace, however he is unable to take the first step and realize what is really wrong with the world. ("Say I got good eyes but I still don’t see, why that world keeps crumbling.") Finally, the line, "Oh, I got good cards but the wrong man’s dealin’." could be asserting that while he sees the simplicity of peace, the wrong people are in charge of getting us there. Unbelievable song, Trevor blows my mind daily.  :trevor:</description>

		<description>"Do You Hear What I Hear?" is a Christmas song written in October 1962 with lyrics by Noel Regney and music written by Gloria Shayne Baker (a songwriting duo who were married at the time). The song was written as a plea for peace during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It has been covered by hundreds of artists.

Trevor Garrod released a version of it on his Myspace page a couple years ago, then TLG played Do You Hear What I Hear (in 2006).

		<description>The end of the second verse, "We don’t need no money never did before.We got all this stuff don’t even know what its for. So take a deep breath cuz were already makin’ it. Well its time to relax, and get naked." is out of this world. This band has a way of summing up life in such a simple way. I love Josh's straightforward approach to love in his lyrics. As far as I know this song has only been played maybe a hand full of times. I would like to see this in rotation more, its worthy.</description>

		<description>Heard this song live and have listened to it numerous times, but it wasn't untill today that I realized its beauty. These lyrics are some of Trevor's best. I think it really resonates the empty feeling of a broken heart. Sometimes life is just so hard that you just want to "stay home". This may be my favorite lyrical work by TLG.</description>

		<description>I'm in the process of completing a dissertation on Garden II for my Ph.D. in Advanced Psychedelia, so allow me to chime in.

Garden II is perfection; it is a signature piece for TLG; it takes you where they want you to go.

A few of my favorites:

2-29-08, taped by our own Brew, is both a Reed GII and a Shakedown tease GII; don't let the incredible bass riffs scare you, you'll be ok.
http://www.archive.org/details/tlg2008-02-29.flac

9-24-04, a great GII from one of the greatest TLG shows. Listen to the entire 1st set, if you're still able to post come back and tell us about it. Pure heat.
http://www.archive.org/details/tlg2004-09-24.flac16

4-2-08, the only time I've seen it live (out of 4); alas, was not recorded.</description>

		<description>Thank you for putting this on the web....I love this song and I've been looking all over for it.  I played around with both seamonkey's and sexm onkey's versions.  I think sexmonkey has it, except that the a7 and b7 really make it ring!! It still sounds good without them, but sounds much better with them.

So here's my suggestion:

Em Em A7 A7
Em Em A7 A7
Em A7 B7

Em Em A7 A7
Em Em A7 A7
Em A7 B7 Em

G G C C
G B7 Em G C

		<description>TABS

Verse: E, A7, G, B

Chorus: C,G,C, B

Breakdown: B, C, C#, D

Outro: G,D,C 

Por ejemplo....
E
Time’s in decline
A7
Standing in line
G
Highway’s abandoned
B
My mind is expanding

C
What’s it gonna take
G
To get home in one piece
C                          B
We won’t get there standing still

And after third verse just slide up a half step 3 times from
B,C,C#,D and then hold that D

G  D C C
I am still standing still
I am still standing still
G D C C
Dark powers within
Light powers without
You funeral grim
Are bringing me down</description>

		<description>Going from the studio album

verse
F C G x3
Am (or F7) C G

Chorus
F G C
F C G
F G C G Am
Am G

F C G

Also a rearrangment of lyrics

From my mother I was born
From my father I take my name
I live my life by the brothers I ride with
Now it’s up to you again

If I could change everything tomorrow
A coward I’d remain
Maybe I could take away your sorrow
But I wouldn’t ask of you the same

Don’t drift away stick to the shallows
Glide above the delta like a crane
Oh tell me true who’s got you strung up on the gallows
It wasn’t me I’m not to blame

Oooohhh…we had a hell of a day

We both have a road that we must follow
Always the same we can’t remain
And even as that road begins to narrow
I hope you come to find your way

From your mother you were born
From your father you take your name
I changed my life my dear brother
Now it’s time for you to do the same

Dont drift away stick to the shallows
Glide above the delta like a crane
Oh tell me true who’s got you strung up on the gallows
Who split you open ‘n’ spilled your brain?

Oooohhh…we had a hell of a day x4</description>

		<description>to finish up the chords for the song....

E D A
E A G D (A)
Dig a hole in the earth.....


also to correct some lyrics.....I believe the first verse is 

Whoa, here she comes
she got a loaded gun
&lt;strong&gt;And why I ain't blown away, I don't even know how

also.....where the eels &lt;strong&gt;crack&lt;/strong&gt; my bones</description>

Garden 1 &#62; Garden 2 &#62; Slept Thru Sunday &#62; Garden 3

G3 was played the first night, out of a rapture segue to end the first set. i didnt think they repeated any garden songs those two days because there were some people who yelled for the garden between every single song.</description>

		<description>I could easily be wrong, but it sounds to me like the lyrics for the 2nd verse  go as such:


I'm lighting the lamps
Before the night tramps
Set up their camps
And light all the fires
Stoking desires
Feeling the heat
Keepin' the beat
Closing (or "clothes in") the street

And for the 3rd:
There's a spirit that screams
There's a spirit that shouts
There's one for bad dreams
There's one to help you get out
You find out you're still
Sleeping beside
The same little girl
Oh baby, sleep tight</description>

The time’s in decline
Standing in line
Highway’s abandoned
My mind is expanding
Heaven and Earth
Are out of communion
Days are numbered
And filled with confusion

Dark powers within
Light powers without
History’s tricks
Won’t fool me now

What’s it gonna take
To get home in one piece
We won’t get there standing still
What’s it gonna take
If all the world is sleeping
Standing still

A storm in the distance
Gives us resistance
The wind is insistent
We should get gone
The light is declining
The highway’s inviting
The coyote's crying
And the dog gets a bone

Dark powers within
Light powers without
The sun sees your sin
And the moon hears you howl

What’s it gonna take
To get home in one piece
We won’t get there standing still
What’s it gonna take
If all the world is dreaming
Standing still

A man from the east
Riding a beast
Sells honeybees
[Of honey he speaks] - Only line I'm not sure about
Offers a ride on
The back of his wagon
His wagon’s alive
And purrs like a dragon

Dark powers within
Light powers without
One sting and you’re dead
Or living without

What’s it gonna take
To get home in one piece
We won’t get there standing still
What’s it gonna take
If all the world is sleeping
Standing still

I am still standing still
I am still standing still
I am still standing still
I am still standing still

I am still standing still
I am still standing still

Dark powers within
Light powers without
You funeral grim
Are bringing me down
Dark powers within
Light powers without
The sun sees your sins
And the moon hears you howl

I am still standing still
I am still standing still
Dark power within
Light power without
History’s tricks
Won’t fool me now
Dark powers within
Light powers without
The sun sees your sins
And the moon hears you howl

I am still standing still
I am still standing still
I am still standing still
I am still standing still</description>

And the moon hears you howl</p>
<p>I am still standing still<br />
I am still standing still<br />
I am still standing still<br />
I am still standing still</p>

		<description>Is it just me or does the first chorus on the RUTT version sound more like "And he's playin' jokes and he's actin' awful mean"?</description>

		<title>Comment on What&#8217;s in The Garden? by Dgold</title>

		<description>2008-08-26 Minnesota State Fair setlist (night II) 
&lt;strong&gt;Garden 1 &gt; Garden 2 &gt; Slept Thru Sunday &gt; Garden 3&lt;/strong&gt;

Perhaps this gives Slept Through Sunday a loose Garden affiliation. It's like a wallet card that says "Supporting Member of The Garden."

This is the first time for that. Slept hasn't traditionally been associated with The Garden sequence. Lyrically it's ambiguous enough that you can fit it into the Garden story if you want to (There's an "I" character in the Garden that's semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical Trevor... and the "I" who found God last Saturday night in Slept can be the same person in the story). But it wasn't conceived to be there in the first place when Slept was written independently. Whenever a song is "planted" in the middle of the Garden in a setlist like this, it brings up the affiliation, and makes a unique Garden sequence that can be reimagined with the new element (if only for that one time).</description>

		<description>Love this song. I hear a few different lyrics on the studio version ... here are my corrections:

What are you &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;

Stoking &lt;em&gt;desires&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Clothes in ( or closing?)&lt;/em&gt; the street

...  those are just the ones that i feel aren't obvious. 

What do you think?</description>
