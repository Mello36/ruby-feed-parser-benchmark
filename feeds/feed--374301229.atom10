			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit that I love top 10 lists. After all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman">David Letterman</a> has some of the best top 10 lists and I always enjoy them. As a marketer, I enjoy reading about what others have done: and I especially like to hear about marketing or public relations opportunities that have gone awry.</p>
<p>As you might recall, I covered the top 10 <a href="http://www.billhartzer.com/pages/top-10-public-relations-blunders-of-2007/">PR blunders</a> of 2007, a big hit. (Lots of people search every day for PR blunders, by the way.) So, without further delay, I present to you the top ten public relations (PR) blunders of 2008, as compiled by <a href="http://www.finemanpr.com/">Fineman PR</a>. Special thanks goes to Aaron Carvell of Fineman PR for sending me this year&#8217;s list.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/aig.jpg" alt="AIG"><br />
<strong>1. AIG (American International Group) All-Expense-Paid Retreats … Paid By the Taxpayers of the United States</strong><br />
A few days days after getting an uprecedented $85 billion federal bailout package from the United States Government, AIG, American International Group Inc. dropped nearly half a million dollars on an executive retreat to the posh St. Regis resort, complete with &#8220;spa treatments, banquets and golf outings,&#8221; according to the Associated Press. Read more about it <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-aig-retreat-pictures-why-its-worse-than-you-think">here</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=aig+retreat+scandal">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/big-3-auto-ceos-bailout.jpg" alt="Automotive Bailout"><br />
<strong>2. AP to Detroit Three Automakers: &#8220;old way of doing business just won’t fly.&#8221;</strong><br />
General Motors CEO Richard Wagoner, Chrysler CEO Robert Nardelli and Ford CEO Alan Mulally flew to Washington in separate corporate jets to ask Congress for $25 billion … without a turnaround plan.  PR Week reported that &#8220;it made the Big Three appear out of touch, and evoked memories of the AIG retreat controversy.&#8221; The Los Angeles Times reported that &#8220;their first attempt was a lemon.&#8221;  So when the execs made their second foray to Washington to further plead their case, they drove there in hybrid vehicles … and made sure everyone knew it.  But Meredith Vieira on Today was unimpressed.  &#8220;They should have carpooled,&#8221; she said. Later on, the big 3 automaker CEOs realized their mistakes, actually put together plans for getting a loan from the US Government, and drove themselves from Detroit to Washington.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/dept-vet-affairs.jpg" alt="Department of Veterans Affairs"><br />
<strong>3. Department of Veterans Affairs says &#8220;Shhh!&#8221; To Veterans’ Problems</strong><br />
In this day of digital justice, it is surprising that federal officials still believe their emails are kept private, as when messages between top officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs indicated secrets were being kept about appallingly high suicide attempt rates among veterans.  According to the Associated Press, Dr. Ira Katz, top-ranking VA mental health official, emailed colleagues that &#8220;12,000 veterans a year attempt suicide while … under [Veterans Affairs] treatment.&#8221;  Katz wasn’t pushing for reform but hiding data from CBS News, even beginning the email with a &#8220;Shh!&#8221;  Everett A. Chasen, chief communications officer for the VA, wrote that &#8220;I don’t want to give CBS any more numbers on veterans [sic] suicides or attempts than they already have – it will only lead to more questions.&#8221;  Emails get leaked in most organizations, but the true Blunder is the Department’s disregard for veterans’ wellbeing.  Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., chair of the House Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs, told CBS News &#8220;this is disgraceful … a crime against our nation, our nation’s veterans.  [V.A. officials] do not want to come to grips with the reality, with the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/johnmccain-katiecouric.jpg" alt="John McCain and Katie Couric"><br />
<strong>4. David Letterman asks John McCain, &#8220;do you need a ride to the airport?&#8221;</strong><br />
Presidential candidate Senator <a href="http://truthmonk.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/would-a-media-that-is-liberal-do-this-part-2/">John McCain cancelled</a> his thirteenth appearance on the David Letterman show (CBS&#8217; Late Night with David Letterman. John McCain said that he was &#8220;suspending his campaign&#8221; and &#8220;racing to the airport&#8221; to tackle the financial crisis. However, halfway through the David Letterman show, David Letterman learned that John McCain was a blocks away … sitting down with another CVS television personality, Katie Couric. David Letterman got a live feed of the interview and, joined by stand-in guest Keith Olbermann of MSNBC, remarked at John McCain’s expense.  John McCain’s response, when he did make it onto Late Night a couple weeks later, was apt but unapologetic: &#8220;I screwed up.&#8221; Well, at least he admitted that he screwed up, right?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/nike.jpg" alt="Nike"><br />
<strong>5. Nike Just Blew It</strong><br />
When self-described &#8220;good, solid&#8221; marathoner and elementary school teacher Arien O’Connell unexpectedly <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/21/BAUC13L3GQ.DTL&#038;nopu=1">clocked the fastest time</a> in October’s San Francisco Women’s Marathon, besting her personal record by over 12 minutes, race sponsor Nike had a golden opportunity to support those who &#8220;just do it.&#8221;  However, Nike only checked times of those in the allegedly &#8220;elite&#8221; front-running pack; by the time Arien O’Connell realized she had been fastest, all places had been awarded and Nike would not recognize her victory.  Later that week, pressured Nike recanted its initial stance, declaring O’Connell &#8220;a winner&#8221; but not the winner.  C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle lamented the tepid ending to &#8220;what could have been a lovely Cinderella story.&#8221;  Only after competitor Reebok stepped up to award O’Connell free shoes for a year and a $2,500 donation for her classroom did O’Connell receive her &#8220;first place overall&#8221; trophy. Nike blew it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/vytorin.jpg" alt="vytorin"><br />
<strong>6. Merck &#038; Company and Schering-Plough Corporation: Profits with Side Effects</strong><br />
Prescription for a Blunder: market cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia with a memorable $100 million plus advertising campaign.  Withhold study results showing that the combo doesn’t work as claimed … for 21 months.  Watch the drugs pull $5.2 billion in revenue in 2007 alone.  Side effects, though, may include widespread consumer backlash, around 140 civil class-action lawsuits, and the unwelcome attentions of Congress, the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 35 state attorneys general, according to the Associated Press.  Makers Merck &#038; Co. and Schering-Plough Corp. allegedly didn’t release the results due to internal scientific concerns.  Matthew Herper of Forbes reported there were &#8220;reasons to doubt the result [of the study].&#8221;  Under pressure, Merck and Schering-Plough pulled their quirky &#8220;Food and Family&#8221; ads, but dwindling investor confidence still pushed Merck stock down to Vioxx-era levels.  Martha Rosenberg of AlterNet.com opined, &#8220;Merck is repeating its mistakes … It&#8217;s getting tough to find any Merck drug that can hold up to scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/mark-penn.jpg" alt="Mark Penn"><br />
<strong>7. Mark Penn: Spinning Out of Control</strong><br />
Mark Penn found himself <a href="http://www.changetowin.org/connect/2008/04/mark_penn_has_to_go.html">dropped</a> from the chief strategist role in Senator Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign when The Wall Street Journal exposed Penn’s work on behalf of the government of Colombia, a client for whom Penn was also involved in arranging passage of a controversial trade bill opposed by, among others, Clinton herself.  Penn was removed from the helm, although his polling firm, Penn, Schoen &#038; Berland Associates, continued to provide services to the campaign.  He ultimately admitted to an &#8220;error in judgment,&#8221; but how many of those can one person convincingly admit to?  Penn’s other unbelievable missteps throughout the year, including praising McCain attack ads and demeaning Clinton supporters, calling them &#8220;downscale voters,&#8221; earn him a seat among serial PR blunderers.  Jason Linkins of The Huffington Post called Penn &#8220;dumber than previously realized&#8221; and a &#8220;despised, incompetent … microtrending ninnybot.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/samantha-power.jpg" alt="Samantha Power"><br />
<strong>8. Senior Barack Obama Campaigner Makes &#8220;a Monster&#8221; of a Slip</strong><br />
Sometimes a simple goof can be a major gaffe if committed by an insider.  For example, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/06/samantha-power-resigns-ov_n_90339.html">Samantha Power</a>, senior foreign policy advisor to presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama, called Senator Hillary Clinton &#8220;a monster&#8221; in a March interview with UK newspaper The Scotsman, then realized her error and immediately tried to withdraw her comment, claiming &#8220;that is off the record.&#8221;  However, in the dustup to follow, blogger Michael Goldstein of MondayMorningMediaQuarterback.com noted that &#8220;you can’t do it.  There is no off the record.&#8221;  Many journalists agree, including Gerri Peev, the Scotsman reporter who interviewed Power, who noted that journalists are &#8220;not in the business to self-censor … [they are] in the business to print the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/absolut-world.jpg" alt="Absolut World"><br />
<strong>9. &#8220;Absolut Mistake,&#8221; says PR Week</strong><br />
Swedish vodka-maker Absolut is famed for its clever, well-executed advertising campaigns, but the company hasn’t realized it’s a <a href="http://netsharc.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/my-take-on-the-absolut-world/">small world after all</a>.  According to PR Week, ads for the Mexican market from the company’s &#8220;Absolut World&#8221; campaign showing the western U.S. as Mexican territory &#8220;courted animosity&#8221; and &#8220;stirred up negative sentiment from … [those] who complain about the porous U.S. border&#8221; after appearing on U.S. blogs.  Absolut pulled the offending ads and proffered a public apology on its corporate blogs, but competitor Skyy Vodka capitalized on the situation.  According to Ken Wheaton’s Advertising Age blog, Skyy did &#8220;what a marketer should do in a situation like this, [taking] advantage of a competitor&#8217;s headache&#8221; by distributing a humorous press release in which it touts Skyy’s U.S. origins and production.  Smart opportunistic marketing … with a twist.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/images/berkeley-marine-corps.jpg" alt="Berkeley City Council"><br />
<strong>10. Hut, Two, Three, Four, Berkeley Rants Against Our Corps</strong><br />
Berkeley, California, has been known for an anti-establishment atmosphere, one in which free speech and independent thought are held dear.  But when the Berkeley City Council <a href="http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?p=15867">denounced local Marine Corps recruiters</a> as &#8220;<a href="http://olbroad.com/2008/01/31/berkeley-on-its-own/">uninvited and unwelcome intruders</a>&#8221; and &#8220;sales people known to lie to and seduce minors,&#8221; it incited yet another nationally covered culture clash depicting Berkeley’s leadership as hopelessly out of touch.  Although individual members of the Council did admit that they may have acted rashly, no apology was ever issued.  According to Peter Schrag of the Sacramento Bee, the incident demonstrated &#8220;that you can be within shouting distance of one of the world’s great educational institutions and still be terminally stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every year, San Francisco-based Fineman PR puts together their PR Blunders List as a reminder that public relations is critical to businesses and organizations.  Selections are limited to Americans, American companies or offenses that occurred in America.  Selections are limited to avoidable acts or omissions that caused adverse publicity; image damage was done to self, company, society or others; and acts that were widely reported in 2008.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the United States Government has been giving out money recently and calling it a &#8220;bailout&#8221;, many different industries have been stepping forward and trying to stake their claim. We have already seen a bailout in the financial industry, and we have recently seen the automotive industry go to Capital Hill to explain and argue with government officials about getting a bailout. So, I thought it would be appropriate to come up with six reasons why the Search Engine Optimization industry needs a bailout.</p>
<p><a href="http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/11/17/pubcon-bruce-clay-ranking-is-dead/"><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wpn-rankings-dead.jpg" alt="" title="wpn-rankings-dead" width="350" height="240" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-657" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Search Engine Rankings are Dead.</strong> Bruce Clay <a href="http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/11/17/pubcon-bruce-clay-ranking-is-dead/">recently declared</a> that search engine rankings are dead. Pretty soon companies won&#8217;t be going to Google to check their rankings for their top 3 most important keywords. They won&#8217;t have a need to keep paying for search engine rank checking programs and services that will &#8220;check your rankings&#8221; every 5 hours. The software developers who write and update those scripts will soon be out of a job. By giving the SEO industry a financial bailout, those who will soon be out of a job will be able to get trained on how to create content. And it will keep them out of the unemployment line.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/barack-obama.jpg" alt="" title="barack-obama" width="240" height="182" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-655" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Barack Obama was elected because of Social Media Marketing</strong> Barack Obama successfully used social media marketing to get elected. He&#8217;s all behind social media and hasn&#8217;t spent a dime on Search Engine Optimization. Barack Obama needs to help SEOs with a bailout because everything seems to be leaning more towards marketing in the social arena..and more SEOs need to start to understand marketing in this new social media economy.</p>
<p><strong>3. It helps the Online Retailers indirectly.</strong> Bailing out the SEO industry is really an efficient way of directing fiscal stimulus towards the online retailers who really need the cash. Giving money to SEOs will help them be more efficient and will help get better search engine rankings for their clients, the online retailers.</p>
<p><strong>4. It will help the Internet stocks.</strong> Ultimately, it helps the Search Engine Optimization companies buy more links. I can&#8217;t believe I said that. But, we all know that lazy SEO companies buy links. By bailing out the SEO industry, you&#8217;re pumping more money into the internet. It will ultimately help those internet stocks go up.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/traffic-power-scam.jpg" alt="" title="traffic-power-scam" width="257" height="241" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-653" /></p>
<p><strong>5. It might be cheaper than the alternative of letting SEO companies fail.</strong> If any SEO company fails, then all of those <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/traffic-power-ceo-in-jail/">snake oil SEO salesmen</a> will be forced to move on to another industry: and then the government will spend lots of money hiring Federal Prosecutors to go after them. We all know that the FCC and the US Government is not doing much to prosecute all the rip-off SEO snake oil salesmen out there. Bail out the SEO industry and you&#8217;ll keep them in the SEO industry: they won&#8217;t move on to another industry where they the government will have to prosecute them.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pile-of-money.jpg" alt="" title="pile-of-money" width="240" height="160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-659" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Pumping money into the SEO industry will help the internet companies be more profitable.</strong> I said it before. By pumping money into the SEO industry the search engine optimization companies and SEO consultants will be able to make those internet companies more profitable. More profitable internet companies mean their stocks will go up.</p>
<p>I can envision a financial bailout that goes directly to the search engine optimization industry and those who work in the SEO industry, including search engine optimizers and the search engine optimization companies themselves. By pumping more money into the SEO industry, SEO companies will be able to hire more writers and web developers to create more content. By creating more content for clients the internet companies will do better: they will then be able to spend more money on paid search campaigns, which will ultimately not only help themselves (the online retailers and those companies that actually have web sites) but it will also help the search engines because they&#8217;re paying more for PPC ads.</p>
<p>So count me in on a strategically-oriented bail-out financial package that benefits the SEOs and SEO companies rather than giving money to the auto industry or any other industry that might beg for a financial bailout.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mamma.com/"><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mamma-homepage.jpg" alt="" title="mamma.com homepage" width="350" height="226" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-647" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks">Dallas Mavericks&#8217;</a> owner <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/">Mark Cuban</a> has been <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122693827604333637.html">charged</a> today by the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">SEC</a> with <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/1117081cuban1.html">insider trading</a>. Apparently Mark Cuban dumped his shares in <a href="http://www.mamma.com">Mamma.com</a> right after he confidentially learned about a stock offering from the CEO of Mamma.com. This was back in 2004.</p>
<p>Immediately after I heard about Mark Cuban being accused of insider trading, I went on over to <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> to see <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22Mark+Cuban%22+OR+Cuban">what people were saying about it</a>. If you didn&#8217;t know, you can use the search.twitter.com site to search and find what people are saying about a particular topic. You can also search for your company name or even your name or another keyword. What you might want to do is use the RSS feed of the query to watch or monitor the search query if you need to watch that keyword. I often look for my name and my company&#8217;s name to see what they&#8217;re saying, if anything.</p>
<p>I also took a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>  and noticed that the top search phrase is <strong>mamma.com</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/google-trends1.jpg" alt="" title="Google Trends" width="201" height="246" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-642" /></p>
<p>I am not sure when the last time I went to Mamma.com was, but apparently their traffic is on the rise. Here&#8217;s an interesting stat from Compete.com:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/compete-mamma.jpg" alt="" title="compete-mamma" width="432" height="99" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-643" /></p>
<p>Compete.com shows that there were over 1 million people who visited Mamma.com last month; which is a lot less than Google&#8217;s 129 million visitors or even Yahoo&#8217;s 125 million. But, I suspect that although they&#8217;re rising last month (October 2008), this Mark Cuban Mamma.com Insider Trading scandal might be just what Mamma needs to get popular again.</p>
<p>I know that this may sound rather opportunistic of me to say, but sometimes getting mentioned in the news can be something that will bring a brand back into the limelight: and really, it wasn&#8217;t anything that Mamma.com actually did, it&#8217;s something that Mark Cuban did back in 2004.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mamma-mark-cuban.jpg" alt="" title="mamma mark cuban" width="350" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-644" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the <a href="http://mamma.com/Mamma?utfout=1&#038;qtype=0&#038;query=mark+cuban">search results for Mark Cuban</a> on Mamma.com. By comparing them to the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=mark+cuban">Google search results for Mark Cuban</a>, I see that they really aren&#8217;t that bad. Mark Cuban is owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, and I&#8217;m seeing search results for the Mavericks as well as his blog and also a page about his appearance on Dancing with the Stars. So perhaps I will start using Mamma.com again. What about you?</p>
<p>Is this additional publicity just what Mamma.com needs to jump start the search engine again?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> Mark Cuban has <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/11/17/the-sec/">issued a statement</a> regarding this through his lawyer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yatinoo.jpg" alt="" title="yatinoo" width="188" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-636" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yatinoo.com/">Yatinoo</a>, a trilingual (English, French, Arabic) web-based portal, community, and search engine, has launched their <a href="http://search.yatinoo.com/">search engine</a> today with new search engine technology. Yatinoo&#8217;s greatest asset is its focus on the Arabic, African and Asian regions as well as the Arabic, African and Asian people living outside the United States.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yatinoo-homepage.jpg" alt="" title="yatinoo homepage" width="350" height="221" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-637" /></p>
<p>Yatinoo&#8217;s focus on the African, Asian, and Arabic regions is significant: approximately twenty percent of the 300 million U.S. population have direct African, Asian or Arabic background representing an additional target market of 60 million users only in the United States. Compared to larger competitors in the search engine market, Yatinoo offers tailor-made and highly targeted services that fit its users&#8217; needs and suit their special &#8220;look and feel&#8221; requirements.</p>
<p>What is interesting about Yatinoo&#8217;s search engine is that this is a search solution that allows you to tailor your interest searches through a diverse range of formats, including web sites, images, audio, video, news, blogs and forums. Additionally, unlike other search engines, you can streamline your selections through Yatinoo&#8217;s ability to offer color images displayed in conjunction with the search results.</p>
<p>What I like to do with new search engines is take a direct look at their search results. For example, I did a search for <a href="http://search.yatinoo.com/search.php?search=search%20engine%20optimization&#038;type=Web&#038;filetype=">search engine optimization</a> at Yatinoo:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yatinoo-search-results1.jpg" alt="" title="yatinoo search results" width="350" height="209" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-638" /></p>
<p>I guess I kind of expected Wikipedia&#8217;s SEO page to be the top search result. But, I did not expect a page about search engine <strong>optimisation</strong> to be at the top of the search results for search engine <strong>optimization</strong>. I know this is a subtle difference, but why mix different spellings?</p>
<p>Yatinoo is a trilingual (English, French, Arabic) Internet based portal, social networking community, and search engine offering various services, tools and content to an international audience which was developed and made available in the Middle East and North Africa region through the introduction of its media properties including Yatinoo.com, which was officially launched in October 2007.

<p>The Business to Business (B2B) search engine <a href="http://www.accoona.com/">Accoona</a> has been acquired by the international B2B search engine <a href="http://www.masterseek.com/">Masterseek</a>. Masterseek was founded in Denmark in 1999.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/masterseek.jpg" alt="" title="masterseek" width="204" height="72" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629" /></p>
<p>Accoona got a lot of press back in 2004 when it launched. I&#8217;m not sure if you remember, but President Bill Clinton was the speaker at the opening. Over the years, Accoona has been fairly successful in China, where Accoona has supplied the search function to both Sina.com and Sohu. Accoona has an exclusive partnership with China&#8217;s most widely-read daily newspaper, the China Daily News.</p>
<p>In 2006, Accoona was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 50 best websites. </p>
<p>In this latest deal, the Accoona search service and the Accoona domain names have now been sold to the Masterseek Corporation.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/accoona-search.jpg" alt="" title="accoona-search" width="350" height="190" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-632" /></p>
<p>As a part of the deal, Accoona will be integrated with Masterseek and they will re-launch Accoona in a few weeks. Until they re-launch, a beta version is available at <a href="http://www.accoona.com/">Accoona.com</a> with a simple company search facility. After the re-launch, a new version will have &#8220;a significantly greater amount of company information and more varied search facilities.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/masterseek-homepage.jpg" alt="" title="masterseek homepage" width="350" height="191" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-633" /></p>
<p>Accoona will initially be re-launched in the USA and China. In January, they plan on launching it throughout Europe in conjunction with the launch of a new expanded search functionality. With the acquisition of Accoona, Masterseek will fortify itself in its fight to become one of the largest B2B search engines in the world. The acquisition means that Masterseek will improve its company data and at the same time significantly increase the number of its users.</p>
<p>Masterseek provides free access to company profiles, products and services from more than 50 million companies in 75 countries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ask.com/">Ask.com</a>, a web site that offers search for web sites, images, news, blogs, video, maps and directions, local search and shopping, launched their new &#8220;Election Poll Smart Answers&#8221; that gives you local polling information in just one click: and it&#8217;s a lot faster and easier than any other major search engine. </p>
<p>Ask.com Smart Answers are special search results placed at the top of the Ask.com search results page that have quick facts and links to authoritative content from highly respected sources.</p>
<p>To use the new one-click poll information, go to <a href="http://www.ask.com/">Ask.com</a> and type in a question like &#8220;when do polls open?&#8221; </p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ask-oneclick-whendo.jpg" alt="" title="ask-oneclick-whendo" width="350" height="81" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-622" /></p>
<p>Then, all you need to do is click your state from the drop-down menu:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ask-oneclick-whendo2.jpg" alt="" title="ask-oneclick-whendo2" width="350" height="101" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623" /></p>
<p>After clicking &#8220;Go&#8221;, Ask.com instantly shows the local poll hours and provides quick links to district poll locations and other voting information right on the first search results page. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ask-oneclick-whendo3.jpg" alt="" title="ask-oneclick-whendo3" width="350" height="132" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" /></p>
<p>According to Ask.com, this new Smart Answers feature is part of Ask.com&#8217;s mission to provide us with the best answer, the first time, every time. However, it appears that there are a &#8220;lot more clicks&#8221; required in order to actually find your polling place and where you have to vote. After going through the process on the Ask.com web site, I was then taken to the official State of Texas web site where I had to then perform an additional search at the State of Texas web site:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ask-oneclick-whendo4.jpg" alt="" title="ask-oneclick-whendo4" width="350" height="235" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-625" /></p>
<p>I hate to be cynical about all of the Ask.com new &#8220;one click&#8221; Smart Answers feature, but all that the Ask.com feature does is point you to your own state&#8217;s web site after you choose your state: that&#8217;s hardly &#8220;one click&#8221;. In fact, there are other helpful things that they could do that would make it easier, like actually recognizing your location and forwarding you directly to your state&#8217;s polling information.</p>
<p>What do you get when you use the Ask.com Smart Answers feature when you look to find your polling place and time?</p>

<p><a href="http://affiliates.quintura.com">Quintura</a>, a company that provides a site search, analytics, and monetization platform for online content publishers, has officially launched their Quintura Site Search for publishers who are based in the United States.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.billhartzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/quintura-site-search2.jpg" alt="" title="quintura-site-search2" width="201" height="335" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-618" /></p>
<p>Quintura has developed a hosted site search platform that provides an intuitive, visual-based search and navigation for your site visitors. So far, Maxim magazine and the Russian Newsweek and Cosmopolitan in Russia have been the first to implement Quintura&#8217;s visual-based search on their websites. So far, more than 1,000 publishers have registered to use the Quintura site search solution. The Quintura network has a monthly audience of 10 million site visitors.</p>
<p>If you own a site that has content (i.e., you&#8217;re a blogger or have another content site), then you have yet another opportunity to monetize your site. You sign up for the Quintura service and they will give you some code to put on your site. Then, you&#8217;ll have an interactive site search for your site that looks like a search field with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">Tag Cloud</a> on your site. Ads are integrated into the site search. You can run your own ads (ads that you sell advertisers on your site) or you can rely on Quintura&#8217;s ads.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added the Quintura tag cloud widget here as a sample. Feel free to test it out:</p>
<p><!-- Quintura minicloud code (Flash version) --></p>

<p>The Quintura site search can be fairly easily installed on your site to monetize banner ad placements along with sponsored ad links. If you&#8217;re a publisher, you can increase your advertising revenues by delivering more ad impressions as driven by users&#8217; behavior as they mouse over keywords in the Quintura tag cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers Benefit Too</strong><br />
This is a unique opportunity for advertisers. Your company&#8217;s small image ads (typically your company logo) are displayed in the Quintura search tag cloud as a small expandable icon. An icon expands out into a full advertisement with a picture and text you mouseover the logo. The ad context matches the user search. Clicking an advertisement brings the visitor to your landing page.</p>

<p>Quintura was awarded their first U.S. patent on October 14, 2008, <a href="http://patents.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week42/OG/html/1335-2/US07437370-20081014.html">patent number 7,437,370</a>. The patent is for a &#8220;Search engine graphical interface using maps and images&#8221;. Here is the abstract from the patent:</p>
<blockquote><p>A system and method for visualization of search results includes a map displayed to a user on a screen. The map shows search query terms and optionally other terms related to the search query terms. The display of the terms corresponds to relationship between the terms. A graphical image is displayed next to at least one of the search query terms. The graphical image is associated with a URL that corresponds to a search result. The graphical image is a favorite icon that is derived from the HTML script associated with a webpage at the URL, or an animated image, or a video, or a cycling GIF. A plurality of graphical images can be displayed in proximity to the search query term.
</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Quintura, they currently have several other patents pending. Quintura&#8217;s entrance into the United States search market allows publishers to monetize their sites and gives a whole set of new features to site visitors. Publishers can monetize their sites but they also get enhanced back-end analytics, as well. The Quintura site search analytical tools give publishers real-time access to their site search information, including search term rankings, trends, and analyses for identifying new content requirements based on search interest.</p>
<p>The site search solution is also available to content publishers who do not wish to use its advertising features as a service, offered on a subscription-fee basis. If you are a publisher and would like to sign up for the Quintura service, go <a href="http://affiliates.quintura.com/promo/publisher.phtml">here</a> to learn more and to sign up.</p>
