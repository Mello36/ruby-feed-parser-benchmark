      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a really nice Levi&amp;#8217;s advertisement that I spotted down on Old Street. The ad is made up of different styles of real 501 jeans cut into the shape of butterflies. Check it out before it flies away!&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Cyan Tapes</title>
      <link>http://30gms.com/permalink/cyan_tapes/</link>
      <description>Christian Marclay has some new cyanotypes on show at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York until the 11th. Standing in front of these wall-sized blueprints of unspooled cassette tapes is an immersive experience – these tiny images really don’t so them justice. Here both subject and reproduction are legacy, analog formats and the resulting images are stunning and ethereal.


Also on show is “Looking for Love”, a video work in which a close-up camera is trained upon a record-player needle which is forcibly skipped around vintage pop records, trying to find any mention of love. Mesmerising.</description>

      <description>The V&amp;amp;A was awash with con&amp;#8217;s by the end of this years Village Fete. And what a sorry looking bunch of miscreants you all were – Dance Floor Murderers, Fraudsters, Racketeers, Fashion Criminals and Nuclear Arms Dealers all rubbed shoulders with the other law-abiding visitors.


Criminality saw no boundaries as offenders young and old queued up to have their fictional Civil Liberties stripped. Some followed in the footsteps of other dynamic-duos and chose to be photographed with a partner-in-crime, others took the wrap for themselves and stood in the docks alone. Either way we caught some real hardened crims and did our part at ridding the streets of some of society&amp;#8217;s most dangerous transgressors.


Our thanks goes to all those who took part and kept us busy for the entire event. And, if there are any of you felons reading this who received a Fibre Criminal Record, can you send us a scan of the picture side of your cards so that we can add it to our files.</description>

      <title>Art Street</title>
      <link>http://30gms.com/permalink/art_street/</link>
      <description>In conjunction with the Street Art exhibition at the Tate Modern, various works 

have appeared in the area surrounding the Fibre studio.


Artists from Spain, Italy, France and Brazil were all showing works at the gallery 

and in the nearby streets. Some placed legally, some appear to have been done 

without permission. Either way, the message would seem to be the same: 

Street art’s ok so long as the perpetrator’s not from Britain. 


In a decision I support, the gallery purposefully excluded Banksy in an attempt 

to draw attention to other just as accomplished artists and aspects of the art 

form. Just a shame I think not to celebrate some more of our own emerging 

and already established talent. 


There is a map of the route available for download on the Tate website.</description>
