&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/vianova-rgb.jpg" width="291" height="109" alt="logo" class="right" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frank Scarpaci, President of The Vianova Group (which offers corporate social responsibility consulting services), went from a Basecamp skeptic to an evangelist. He tells us why:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you use Basecamp and why do you like it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We use Basecamp for all of our client projects.  Basecamp is highly effective, to the point that our clients frequently thank us enough for using it! Basecamp makes potentially onerous projects simple and pleasant.   It is extremely easy to learn and helps me deliver a wonderful mix of efficiency, transparency, stakeholder devotion and positive outcomes. In short, it makes my clients quite happy which make me very happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you a Basecamp skeptic at first?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a time, I was enticed by what appeared to be “extra” bells and whistles that some other web-based project management programs might offer. I wondered if perhaps Basecamp was “too simple”. As a seasoned project manager who had absolutely done their homework in reviewing project management software, I initially thought Basecamp was only good for really small and simple projects.  Most of my projects are not small and not simple.  Many times they involve large diverse teams.  After testing many web-based programs I gave up in frustration.  They were too complicated and my concern was I would have to spend way too much time training my clients on how to use it!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I figured I would give Basecamp a try.  Reluctantly I set up my first project which was a large-scale fundraising event involving a large and diverse committee of staff and volunteers.  Much to my surprise the entire group began using Basecamp immediately. More importantly, there are significant intangible team benefits to the “less is more” streamlined eloquence that is Basecamp.  My clients frequently tell me how much they appreciate us giving them a highly effective tool that is so easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said your team gave it rave reviews. What did they like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clients adore the tool for making their lives easier, creating a positive team dynamic and helping creative ideas bubble to the surface. When clients use the words “genius” and “blessing” in describing your project management software, it’s a sure thing you’ll keep on using it! Here are just a few quotes from my happy clients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The best part about Basecamp was that I had one-button access to everything and everyone that I needed to do my job well. It’s simplicity is its genius.”

&lt;p&gt;“But the thing I liked best about it was that it was a great place to keep track of all meeting happenings and the task list (assigning feature) was a great tool to help keep people on task. I like that it allowed us to record documents and limit the amount of printing and reprinting of documents. It served the purpose well and allowed us to limit the amount of face to face meetings required... It was a blessing!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I loved the ability to upload and share files and notify key people without having to send out a ton of e-mails. It was a great way to keep tabs on what everyone else was doing and make sure we were all reaching our milestones. Knowing that everyone else was watching, too, it motivated me to go in and check off my “to do” tasks ahead of schedule.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which features do you use most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Beside file sharing, I would have to say the Writeboards.  They are particularly valuable for projects that include print and graphic design, and my graphic designers and copy writers adore them. One client commented: “The Writeboards were my favorite feature: Being able to go in, share comments and noodle around ideas without having to call in-person meetings was such a time saver and brought lots of ideas to the table from anyone who wanted to comment and not just the members of a particular subcommittee.” In short, Writeboards are simple, effective and contribute to a pleasant work experience. This fits all with and enhances my brand!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a story about a project or situation where Basecamp helped your team succeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/Frank%20at%20Stephens%203.JPG" width="129" height="96" alt="frank" class="left" /&gt;I was asked by a local prestigious civic leadership development organization if I would provide pro bono project management support for one of six teams of high-provide community leaders enrolled in their program.  As part of their curriculum, each team is assigned a 6-month project to benefit a local nonprofit organization.  The team I was assigned to was charged with creating a social enterprise business plan for one of my nonprofit clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that in addition to lending this team my consulting support, I would set this project up in my Basecamp account just like I would any other client project.  I was concerned whether these very busy professionals would use or even appreciate Basecamp.  Well, within hours of setting this project and team up in Basecamp I starting getting rave reviews from the team.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the other teams had a tool like Basecamp available to them.  As a result of the rave reviews from my team, the organization asked that use this as a test pilot.  If having a tool like Basecamp enhances this team’s experience and helps to ensure the project will ultimately be successful, they would provide Basecamp to all the 2009 teams.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were extremely positive.  The team reported that Basecamp helped them accomplish a lot more than expected in a shorter period of time. Basecamp not only supported the effectiveness of the team but also enhanced the experience for this group of busy, high-level executive volunteers.&lt;br /&gt;
The project leader stated: “It served the purpose well and allowed us to limit the amount of face to face meetings that many of the other groups had to do. It was a blessing. Thanks for making us your test subjects!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand we got the green light to rollout Basecamp for the 2009 class! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any Basecamp tips or tricks for other customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted all of our new users to be able to get a quick orientation to Basecamp when they first sign in. So, I created a PowerPoint presentation on how to use Basecamp and uploaded it to SlideShare.  I then added a link to the presentation on the client’s project Overview page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also create a Writeboard to post external resource links related to the type of project.  This gives the team access to information and resources to help them in their role on the project team.  For example: If we are leading a social enterprise development project, we provide the team with a list of great websites, book recommendations and news articles. This helps to improve our client’s overall experience on the team as well as encourage their use of Basecamp.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the first online tool I have used where people of all backgrounds immediately begin using it with very little guidance and support. We manage projects of all sizes, involving diverse groups of people and organizations. I’ve thrown a lot of challenges at it, from the key stakeholder who really didn’t even feel comfortable with e-mail let alone a new software tool, to the highly complex project management assignment. I’m confident now that Basecamp can hit any pitch – out of the park!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientist Darran Edmundson, of &lt;a href="http://www.edmstudio.com/"&gt;EDM Studio, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, wrote an article for "New Journal of Physics" that includes a couple of mentions of &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;. He writes in to tell us about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;img  src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/NJP-highlights-cover.jpg" width="125" height="180" alt="NJP" class="right"&gt;We've just had a journal article (&lt;a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1367-2630/10/12/125005"&gt;Visualizing a silicon quantum computer&lt;/a&gt;) published in the relatively prestigious New Journal of Physics. This is a special issue on visualization, and our article is specifically targeted at scientists looking to successfully lead production (i.e., project manage) an animation. If you search the text, there are a couple of shameless Basecamp plugs ;-)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of quotes from the article that mention &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At EDM's behest, the popular web-based project management tool Basecamp was used for discussion threads, to-do lists, project milestones and file exchange."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to appreciate the cultural differences between the science and animation communities. Ongoing communication is important. Given that the team was scattered across two continents, appropriate project and task management software was essential for success, and Basecamp served the purpose for us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We have released two updates to <a href="http://backpackit.com" target="_blank">Backpack</a> to help your team share and collaborate on pages.</p>

<h2>Set sharing options up-front</h2>

<p>Before this update, every page you created was shared with everyone in your account by default (unless you were the only person on your account). This meant that if you wanted to share with only certain people, or if you wanted to make a private page, you couldn't do it without first saving a page shared with everybody and then changing the sharing settings after the fact. The result was that your private page title could be exposed to people in your account in that brief period between when the page was first created and when you clicked to change the sharing settings.</p>

<p>We've fixed that situation with a new "Make a new page" form. Now you can set the page title and sharing options together in the same step, before the page is ever created.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/154-new page form.png" /></p>

<h2>Page notifications</h2>

<p>Another new feature allows you to notify people in your account that you created or updated a page. Now when you create a new page, you'll see a yellow button at the bottom that says "Tell the others I created this page."</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/155-created-button.png" /></p>

<p>You can click the button to reveal a notification form. Check the people you want to notify and type an optional personal message and then Backpack will send those people an email with a link to your new page.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/156-notification-form.png" /></p>

<p>That last checkbox is for administrators only. Admins can check "Add this page to each person's sidebar" and the page will automatically be added to each person's list of links in their sidebar. Now when you want people to check up on an important page you can be sure they have easy access to it whenever they log in to Backpack.</p>

<p>Page creators aren't the only ones who can send notifications. Anybody who is sharing a page inside a Backpack account will see a button to "Tell the others I've updated this page" at the bottom of the page. Clicking that button displays the same form as the one above.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/157-updated-button.png" /></p>

<p>We hope these new features make it easier for you to share <a href="http://backpackit.com" target="_blank">Backpack</a> pages with your team!</p></div>

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Record Producer &lt;a href="http://www.moriartyrecording.com/"&gt;Bill Moriarty&lt;/a&gt; and his manager Chris Radwanski use &lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com"&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of all of Bill's album projects. Bill tells us all about it below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/Moriarty screenshot 630 pixels.jpg" width="630" height="391" alt="screenshot of HR" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you need Highrise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/Bill Moriarty.jpg" width="140" height="167" alt="bill" class="right" /&gt;I'm in the studio most of the time so my phone's off, the internet's off... I'm making sure the tape machine's running right and the band's playing their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My manager, Chris, deals with all the communications, logistics and a lot of planning on every album I make. With Highrise I can login and see all the progress that's been made toward getting a band in the studio and then follow up with the artist about the music we're going to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite living in the same city we rarely see each other in person, we barely have meetings, we don't have conference calls, we don't do IM… Highrise is where everything goes. It's how Chris &amp; I stay in sync with what was said, what was promised, potential projects, and where I'm currently in an album's progress. If we worked only in email all these vital communications would just be lost in the email noise. Using Highrise makes us focus just on what's important to making records and running our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which features do you use most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We actually use &lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com/tour#cases"&gt;Cases&lt;/a&gt; the most. Since it's just two of us we don't need the full project management of Basecamp. Besides individual contacts we make a "Company" for each band and a "Case" for each album. Everything important that gets said about an album goes into the album's "case."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, Chris is working with 15 potential records at a time. He titles it, oh, for example, "lead:Drink Up Buttercup's new album" and uploads demos for me to listen to, notes about how the band wants to make their album, possible recording dates, where in the world this may be recorded, and assigns me todo's for when &amp; how to get back to the artist about their project. Once that lead becomes a definite project we just delete "lead:" from the Case's title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have contacts and companies for the artists, labels, and musicians we speak with regularly. On DHH's blog advice we don't put everyone in Highrise; just the people that matter to running our business. Again, it's about focusing on what's important: doing one thing at a time and doing it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What did you use before and why did you switch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I used to use Daylite. A few months into it I realized I don't want to maintain a huge database. It was asking for so much information and offered so many parameters I thought if I didn't fill them in I'd be missing some crucial business success tool. Nope. Pretty soon I dreaded opening Daylite, updating its database became just another chore and inevitably it simply didn't get updated. It became useless. Highrise has been the opposite: quick to use, no learning curve, we use what features we want, it always works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a story about a project or situation where Highrise helped you out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I really like having Highrise online. It doesn't matter what part of the world I'm in or that my Powerbook just died. Nothing's lost, nothing's inaccessible. I'm working on around 10 albums at various stages simultaneously. Every album produces a myriad of emails and phone calls. Having to tell each other what was said would slow us down and lose information. It's simple… talk to a band member, put it in Highrise, Chris &amp; I are in sync on 25 albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you use a 37signals product in an interesting or noteworthy way? &lt;a href="mailto:&amp;#101;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#064;&amp;#051;&amp;#055;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#103;&amp;#110;&amp;#097;&amp;#108;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jorge Arango of &lt;a href="http://bootstudio.com"&gt;BootStudio&lt;/a&gt; writes in about his team's use of 37signals products:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;About our company&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/bootstudio.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Members of the BootStudio team" class="right" /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bootstudio.com"&gt;BootStudio&lt;/a&gt; creates and manages engaging websites for large organizations in Central America (and beyond). We have a passion for simple, eloquent, standards-based interfaces that get the job done with a minimal amount of fuss. We've been around since 1995, when Internet access was starting to become commercially available in this region, so ours was one of the first web design firms in this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;The 37signals products we use, and why we like them&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Ours is an (almost) entirely web-based business. We manage our day-to-day work on the 37signals suite (along with Google Apps and a few other web-based apps):&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is our main project management space; it's where we share files, project notes, deadlines, pending tasks, checklists, etc.  We love that all members of each project team&amp;mdash;including clients&amp;mdash;can have access to the latest information at any time, from anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com"&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is where we manage everything "meta" about the company: contract negotiation, business development, human resources issues, etc. Most of these threads are centered on people, so Highrise makes an excellent control center and filing cabinet for these activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.backpackit.com"&gt;Backpack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is our intranet. It's where we update each other on our availability ("working remotely this afternoon"), document processes, and interesting news and developments about our industry.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We also use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.campfirenow.com"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as a replacement for IM, although much of our use of this app been overtaken by Backpack's &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; feature.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Last but certainly not least,&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/"&gt;Getting Real&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been influential in the way we think about our work. Central America is a "developing market": a euphemism that means that expectations are high, and budgets low. We've had to learn to be nimble and efficient, and the &lt;em&gt;Getting Real&lt;/em&gt; ethos has inspired and influenced us.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;We like that the 37signals applications have consistent, elegant interfaces; it's been very easy for us to get new team members up-to-speed. The apps also have a well-considered feature set that strikes a smart balance between power with usability. For example, while Backpack isn't as flexible as Google Sites (which we evaluated, given we'd paid for it as part of Google Apps), the former provides the features we need without the complexity that comes with the richer feature set of the latter. We've found that with a bit of ingenuity we can do pretty much anything with these tools. (The one thing we haven't been able to work around is that the app UIs are presented exclusively in English. While this hasn't been too much of a problem for our clients, we can see it becoming more of an issue as we start doing more business with folks in other Spanish-speaking regions.)&lt;/p&gt;

	
&lt;h2&gt;The collaboration ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Over the years we've tried many solutions to manage our work, on- and offline. One of the issues we've had with many of the apps we've used before is that they weren't very open. As a result, it was very difficult to use the information that resided in one app from within another.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The 37signals products seem to have ushered in a new era in practical software for businesses of our size. For one thing, the "highly focused and elegant web app that solves real business needs" space that 37signals popularized has spawned a wide variety of solutions for all sorts of needs (e.g.: there are now front ends to version control systems, timekeeping apps, invoicing apps, etc.) For another, the fact that many of these apps (beginning with Basecamp and Backpack) expose APIs means that many of them can interoperate much more openly than was previously possible. This has been a boon for businesses such as ours, that want to pick-and-choose the components of their collaboration infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;A concrete example: we used to manage our team's time with Basecamp's built-in time tracking feature, using the third-party &lt;a href="http://www.timepost2.com/"&gt;Timepost.app&lt;/a&gt; application for time entry. Following a growth spurt, we started needing more comprehensive timekeeping reports, so we added &lt;a href="http://www.getharvest.com/"&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt; to our mix. Because both Harvest and Basecamp expose APIs, we were able to quickly import all of our projects and clients from Basecamp, and our team members just kept using Timepost.app as they had before. The three apps interoperate seamlessly, even though different companies produce them, and as a result we were able to implement this change over the course of an afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;We're very excited by what we see as a growing ecosystem of apps that can be loosely linked together to create solutions that are "just right" for our needs. We are always exploring new components to this ecosystem, and our processes are consistently becoming more efficient as a result. (The main missing component right now is a good accounting app. Do you have any plans to develop a Quickbooks-killer? :-) )&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;A tip for other customers: think about information architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;We've found that the most value can be obtained from these collaboration apps when everyone can easily find the information they need, when they need it. In order to achieve this, all team members need to be clear on &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; different items should be posted. Consistency is the name of the game, and over time our team has developed naming schemes that make it easier for us to know where to look for things later. Thinking carefully about the information architecture of the things we can customize in these tools&amp;mdash;category names, project labeling schemes, message titles, etc.&amp;mdash;has made a big difference in how usable (and useful) they are to us and to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/blogBlazersBook.jpg" width="196" height="264" alt="Blazers" class="right"  style="border: none;" /&gt;Thank you very much &lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com"&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt; for making such an amazing product. I'm using it with my assistants to manage the contacts for the marketing of my new best selling book &lt;a href="http://www.BlogBlazers.com"&gt;Blog Blazers&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does it allow us to manage who's who, we also use it to manage who's been sent books to review, who to follow-up with, and when to follow-up with them. Basically it's a great tool to keep track of our marketing efforts for the book. I can't imagine being without it!

&lt;p&gt;What's also very exciting for us is that we use &lt;a href="http://www.userscape.com/products/helpspot/"&gt;HelpSpot&lt;/a&gt; to manage internal emails, and they've created an &lt;a href="http://www.userscape.com/helpdesk/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=194"&gt;integration plugin for Highrise right into their products&lt;/a&gt;. So as we email people, we can do what's called a "Live Lookup" right into the software and get the benefits of Highrise with our email client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not only are we able to leverage the power of Highrise to manage our contacts, we're also able to leverage the power of their web services!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the fine folks at Highrise, I can't imagine launching my book with any other tool!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you use a 37signals product in an interesting or noteworthy way? &lt;a href="mailto:&amp;#101;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#064;&amp;#051;&amp;#055;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#103;&amp;#110;&amp;#097;&amp;#108;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.weareinto.com/"&gt;INTO&lt;/a&gt; is a web/print startup specializing in "cutting edge work, quick turn-around times, and a high level of web expertise." Below, INTO founder Kirk Strobeck details the creative ways his team uses &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, including as a content management system and wireframing tool!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/team2.jpg" width="240" height="152" alt="team" class="right" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you use our products and why do you like them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We depend on Basecamp. It has become a cornerstone for our project management and client communication. As soon as we get wind of a project, we've got it set up in Basecamp; it is step 1. Out of that we grow our communication--instantly gaining credibility and dependability by messaging and stockpiling infos online. Of all the aspects of our business, it's one of the few that we don't have to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, project management isn't its only purpose at INTO. Upon browsing 37Signals we saw three letters on the footer, "API," we did a quick search for a way to connect to the backdoor of our favorite web application. After seeing the available data and the need for a simple server-side CMS that worked &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; Basecamp, we figured why not just &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; Basecamp as a CMS. We're a transparent company, so if it works &amp;mdash; use it. We did, and we're happy to say it works great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now use Basecamp in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As a project management tool&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As a content management system&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As a website wireframing tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a project management tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When someone sings, it's an incredible instrument. Not only can you hear the tune, tempo, and vibe of a song, but you can clearly absorb what is being communicated. In the same way, Basecamp is an incredble tool. While you work your way through a project, there are not only deliverable results, but a detailed record of everything that has been done and is yet to be done. It formalizes our business practices without skipping a beat and becomes a solid escape from redundant explanations... "Check basecamp, it's all up there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a content management system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For some light-weight websites we do what we call a "Basecamp install." In these websites we have fixed navigation and semi-flexible content. While the API doesn't support graphic integration yet, it does lend itself to text changes. Here are a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://saltstudio.com"&gt;saltStudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We didn't want to do a large CMS install for this client, because practically it only needed recent news. We could apply manual updates for the other sections. We made a backend script that checks Basecamp, and sees what new news posts are available, then writes a new content file and refreshes it for the next visit. While it is a flash movie, we simply import the textfile and have a news section. We don't only pull the messages here, but also the employee information from the "People" tab mounts data to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/saltstudio.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="script" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A script checks Basecamp, sees what new news posts are available, then writes a new content file and refreshes it for the next visit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottystable.net/"&gt;ScottysTable.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://armineart.com/"&gt;ArmineArt.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With these examples we don't use a cache file, it is a direct request and display. While there is a minor loadtime cost, the benefits outweigh it. As simply as you write or edit a message, the site is updated and refreshed. This offers an easy way to deliver our client a quick solution without worrying about backend functionality and appearence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since you can pull the data you want, you can make using Basecamp and updating your website a single seamless process. Assign an internal todo to an employee and tab over to post a new message in the "News" category, now publicly visible on your site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're pleased to say that we've only scratched the surface of what is possible with this business extension. Just imagine the potential ways to communicate internal progress quickly, publicly, and seamlessly -- you also get to use the line "If you can use Basecamp, you can update your website."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a website wireframing tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the easiest internal sharing uses is website navigation/content wireframing. Using the same principals as the "Basecamp install," we create a Basecamp for our client and give them the flexiblity to edit page names (titles) and message body (page content) using textile. It's easy to work through the information mountain, while simultaneously approving content and finalizing structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/wireframing.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="wireframing" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using Basecamp for website navigation/content wireframing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we used before and why we switched&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As far as project management goes, we used old-school email and paper todo lists. We're in a better place now. As far as jimmy rigging a CMS, we also had used &lt;a href="http://goplan.org"&gt;GoPlan&lt;/a&gt;, but found the Basecamp solution much more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of Setting Contexts has published a couple of posts about using 37signals products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://settingcontexts.com/2008/03/30/how-Backpack-is-saving-my-sanity/"&gt;How Backpack is Saving My Sanity&lt;/a&gt; talks about using the entire suite of 37signals tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time in a few months I feel like I’m more in control - not just organized, but working with my teams more efficiently. And my teams have been very supportive in trying these tools out and participating. While I don’t have the ability to block off time each day to get work done (too many meetings - grrr) without interruption, I can track what needs to be done and get things done before and after the “workday”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://settingcontexts.com/2008/09/30/living-a-virtual-office-kinda-life/"&gt;Living a Virtual Office Kinda Life&lt;/a&gt; talks about the web-based tools the author uses at work to stay organized and keep in touch. Among the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://basecamphq.com/?source=svn+sidebar" title="Basecamp project management"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Basecamp" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-basecamp.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; - we use it for project management and have just started to share with our clients. It took a full day to reorganize the existing account when I started - I also put together a couple of screencasts for our team to learn how to use it. I&amp;#8217;m also planning to do a couple for our clients so that they feel comfortable using it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://backpackit.com" title="Backpack information manager"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Backpack" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-backpack.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.backpackit.com/"&gt;Backpack&lt;/a&gt; - we use this as our own intranet. Anything internal (not project-based) goes here. This has been really successful in terms of adoption - everyone has been adding to pages as well as adding their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://highrisehq.com/?source=svn+sidebar" title="Highrise shared contact manager"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Highrise" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-highrise.png?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com"&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt; - we&amp;#8217;re using this for our CRM solution and to track our new business process. As of right now, only the crayonistas involved with new business have access.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the rest of &lt;a href="http://settingcontexts.com/2008/09/30/living-a-virtual-office-kinda-life/"&gt;Living a Virtual Office Kinda Life&lt;/a&gt; to see the other tools listed (Twitter, iPhones, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<p><strong>What does your company do?</strong><br />
Our company is a home design and plan provider based in Thomaston, Connecticut. We began by providing custom home design services to the local building industry in 1985. Since our inception over 20 years ago, we have grown into a nationally recognized plan service providing house plans and garage plans in a variety of styles and sizes. From the beginning, our mission was to provide unique, quality, economical home plans to consumers and builders. </p>

<p><strong>Why do you need Highrise?</strong><br />
I use Highrise to keep track of all sorts of people; those that advertise on our site and even people that call us and ask some questions. This way it allows me to keep all their information together since sometimes it may take days to gather answers to a caller’s questions.</p>

<p><strong>How do you use Highrise and why do you like it?</strong><br />
I use Highrise to keep track of prospective customer’s emails to me as well as remind me to follow up with them if need be.</p>

<p><strong>Which features do you use the most?</strong><br />
Well that would have to be the dropbox followed by a close second with notes.</p>

<p><strong>What did you use before and why did you switch?</strong><br />
I tried a few programs as well as just a simple spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was a mess and nothing else offered anything nearly as useful as Highrise.</p>

<p><strong>Get specific. Tell us a story about a project or situation where Highrise helped you out.</strong><br />
Highrise proves its self everyday when I receive an email or phone call with someone that I had been in correspondence with but had forgotten about. I quickly open Highrise and search their name in the nice fast search utility. This way it reminds me of their information and allows for a personalized phone call as well as eliminating the need of asking them to remind me who they are. Another way this helps me out is if my boss loses a phone message that I had provided him I still have a backup of the numbers, addresses, and any other information provided to me during the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Any tips or tricks for other customers?</strong><br />
Not really anything that’s not self explanatory. Other than use my favorite tool the dropbox often.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>Ciaron Dunne of Broadband Genie on <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a></em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/6a00d83534b21169e2010535f015d6970c-800wi-1.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="BG" class="right" /><a href="http://www.broadbandgenie.co.uk">Broadband Genie</a>, the broadband comparison website, has been going since 2003 and we're old-time Basecamp aficionados. Right from the start (just like at a lot of internet companies) the Broadband Genie team has been scattered far and wide across the UK because we needed people with the right skills more than people in the right places. Remote working and collaboration tools have therefore been unimaginably important to us; we just wouldn't exist without them.</p>

<p><strong>Everything in one place</strong><br />
We fell for Basecamp after a brief and misguided flirtation with Microsoft Sharepoint and some experimentation with open-source solutions such as NetOffice. The biggest thing straight away was quite simply the ability to upload graphic designs, specifications and so on and have everybody comment on it in one place, then iterate and so on. Attempting this sort of thing with a large group via email is pretty much a non-starter and can end badly. What Basecamp gave us was a single place where everybody could see everything that was going on, and (just as importantly) a record of what had gone on previously.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/6a00d83534b21169e2010535f01588970c-800wi.jpg" width="630" height="473" alt="BG" /></p>

<p><strong>Working at different times</strong><br />
Another benefit was that Basecamp facilitated people working at different times. We had programmers and designers who only came out when the sun went down, and it was beautiful to get up in the morning and see a whole load of progress without cluttering up my inbox.</p>

<p><strong>The TO DO list</strong><br />
As Broadband Genie has evolved, I guess our use of Basecamp has changed. The TO DO list is the central project and task management tool for the whole country, and we seem to be able to use it for everyday thoughts and queries as well as for major projects. The ability the comment on TO DO items has really, really made this so much better. We barely use the message board functionality any more. We recently project managed a major web development for us - our <a href="http://mobile.broadbandgenie.co.uk/">mobile broadband comparison site</a> - entirely through the TO DO list, co-ordinating a team of up to ten people.</p>

<p><strong>"You name it, we manage it through Basecamp!"</strong><br />
It's also true that Basecamp has permeated other areas of the business. We also offer some internet marketing consultancy services, and so we just set up projects for our clients and give them access, while still being able to pull everything together into one uber TO DO list. Consultancy, accountancy (even my wedding) - you name it, we manage it through Basecamp!...</p>

<p>We've not seen anything on the market to touch it - so keep up the good work.</p>

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduced email-reply to messages and comments in Basecamp a few months ago. It's been a huge hit. Today we're excited to be able to print this new feature to Backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now respond to any message posted in Backpack via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/bp-email-in.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just make sure your reply goes above the...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;--- Reply ABOVE THIS LINE to post a comment to the message ---&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...line and it will appear in the message thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you don't have to log in to respond to a message or comment someone else posted. This new email-reply feature makes &lt;a href="http://www.backpackit.com"&gt;Backpack&lt;/a&gt; an even more useful internal communications tool. We think you'll love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for your continued support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/3019676411_cdfcd72c46.jpg" width="300" height="203" alt="devego" class="right" />Basically we make some websites and web apps for our costumers, and also we recently founded a startup, ( <a href="http://www.atommica.com">atommica</a> ) in which we are cooking our own projects ( all of them mega-cool btw :)</p>

<p>The keypoint here, is that we have a partnership with another agency in London, which works exclusively with print design, and we are providing this guys with the web-interactive part. Imagine the timezone differences, the normal problems that rise in every work situation, and the need to quick-response or quick-action based on all of this projects, everyone with their own deadlines and milestones. This scenario is our "everyday".</p>

<p>The Rock-Age ( as we refer to the pre-basecamp era ) was really chaotic. Mails lost, unread stuff, mixed address, mixed calendars, tasklist in excel files... i mean literally.. chaos.</p>

<p>Now, back to our days, Basecamp is the air we breathe everyday, it gives us all the tools to actually ENJOY this work, while keeping it simple without a "mega-extra" organization or effort from any of the offices. We get all the projects organized by themselves, everyone knows what to do next with the tasklists and we actually dont need to design a really cool intranet for our clients sees some demos, and also the clients don't tamper our emails with their content documents, or the new pictures they need to post in their website.</p>

<em>Milestones at devego's Basecamp account.</em></p><p><br />
Also to extend our "love-affair" with 37signals, we just get a Highrise account, where we are going to organize in a better way our bids, and also we are managing our Team Recruiting from there, it help us to get the most interesting candidates marked, and we all can put notes about them regarding their interviews, and its really really easy take a desition based on all that collected data.</p>

<p>Thanks for this, and it will be great to give our testimonial in your newsletters, we are happy enough to tell the world that this products still worth it, even with a  3.5 Peso to 1 USD exchange rate.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Highrise has been on a roll lately. The new <a href="http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/10/big-new-highris.html">Deals feature</a> has been a huge success. Let's keep the good news coming. Today we're excited to roll out two of the most requested features in <a href="http://www.highrisehq.com">Highrise</a>: CSV (Excel) import, and exporting of notes/emails from contacts, cases, and deals.</p>

<h2>CSV (Excel) import</h2>

<p>You've always been able to import contacts from vCards, Basecamp, Outlook, and ACT!, but we didn't provide an option to import data from a CSV file. Many people keep their contacts in Excel, so now you can export those contacts from Excel into a CSV file and import them into Highrise. <a href="http://highrisehq.com/help/import_export/#import_excel_csv">Here's how it works</a> (from the Highrise help section). Jamis did a great job putting this feature together.</p>

<h2>Export your notes/email</h2>

<p>You've been able to export your contacts from Highrise in vCard or CSV format for a while now. But starting today you can also export your notes/emails from your contacts, cases, and deals.</p>

<p>Here's how it works.</p>

<p>First, click the "My Info" link in the top right corner of the screen. Once you're on the My Info screen, look in the sidebar for the "Export your data" option (highlighted in red for this example):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/myinfo.png" width="315" height="275" /></p>

<p>Click the "Export data" link. You'll then receive an email in a few minutes with a link to download your data.</p>

<p>The data is presented in a single zip file. When you decompress the file you'll see up to three directories: cases, contacts, deals.</p>

<p>Clicking into any one of them will then give you a series of text files. The contacts text files, as seen in the example below, will be named with the contact's name.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/exported-data.png" width="384" height="309" /></p>

<p>When you open one of those files you'll see all the notes/emails attached to that person. It'll look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/export-file.png" width="502" height="710" /></p>

<p>The data is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML format</a> which means it's both human readable and also machine readable. Special thanks to David for making this export feature happen. Yes, he still codes!</p>

<p>Note: You can only export data for contacts, cases, and deals that you have access to see. The export will only contain data that jives with your permissions.</p>

<h2>We hope you find these new features useful</h2>

<p>Thanks for the requests and we're sorry it took us a while to get these features done. But now that they've live we really hope you find them useful. Thanks again for your continued support!<br />

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our UNIQUE luminous system allows you to view the evolution of your projects, tasks and employees in real time. A quick glance is all you need to know exactly everything that's going on in your business...

&lt;p&gt;When an employee is working on a certain project, he must keep his interface up to date by activating the flashing light corresponding to the task(s) he is working on. This update is then automatically carried on to the supervisor interface. This way, the supervisor always knows what the employees are working on in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction is very simple. All data kept in Basecamp is automatically transmitted to VisioPlanning's luminous interface and vice versa. None of your data is cached. When you launch VisioPlanning, you allow it to get data from your Basecamp account to transmit it to VisioPlanning's interface.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have 3 To Do lists -

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com"&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt; To-do’s &lt;em&gt;[Ed. note: Peter presumably means Tasks here.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; To-do’s&lt;br /&gt;
3. Mac Mail To-do’s (which I was hoping would work with iPhone by now??)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has to be an easy way to streamline these. What’s everyone else doing?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac, another customer, offers this thoughtful response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’ve wrestled with this too, and I think seeking a single solution is a fool’s errand.

&lt;p&gt;There is almost NO time that seeing everything we have to do in one place actually helps us, other than by making us anxious. Theoretically, it sounds nice, but I don’t think there’s a practical application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I think keeping tasks somewhat separate allow you to focus on what is important right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://basecamphq.com/?source=svn+sidebar" title="Basecamp project management"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Basecamp" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-basecamp.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’m using Basecamp to-dos for detailed lists of followup tasks with my team, on a complex project, or tracking bug fixes. When you’re working on that project, it’s the only place to be. But Basecamp todos don’t remind you or carry due dates, so they’re really just good for punch lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://highrisehq.com/?source=svn+sidebar" title="Highrise shared contact manager"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Highrise" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-highrise.png?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I use the Highrise tasks for things I have to get done today or by a certain date in order to keep a promise to someone. For this, I appreciate Highrise’s ability to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* receive tasks by email (sent from my phone or desktop)&lt;br /&gt;
* remind me when they’re due&lt;br /&gt;
* tag according to context&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a variation of Chemnitz’s strategy above, to create a Highrise task like “TODAY: clear Basecamp todos on ABC project” if it really has to be done for a client expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href="http://www.highrisehq.com"&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santiago Gomez, IT Manager at &lt;a href="http://www.adwilliams.com/"&gt;A. D. Williams Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, describes how the company set up large LCD monitors on the production floor to show the company's &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; milestones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/Production Monitor 007.jpg" width="530" height="357" alt="monitor" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A monitor displays milestones at A. D. Williams Engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adwilliams.com/"&gt;A. D. Williams Engineering&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-discipline consulting engineering firm in Western Canada, with offices in 5 cities.  We have been using &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; for over 2 years and we love it. It has improved tremendously the way we collaborate among engineering disciplines and across geographical locations.

&lt;p&gt;Our Winnipeg regional director, Tom Zborowsky, wanted to show the late and upcoming milestones in a large LCD monitor on the production floor. He wants to make sure everyone knows which projects are due and when, and as soon as he sees red on the board he knows the project needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new programmer from Germany, Matthias Otto, did an excellent job integrating the Basecamp API and scripting the output to match what we wanted very quickly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom sent me an email yesterday after the display went up: "I love my new production schedule monitor. Great job and the best part is that I can see the red dates from my office. Everyone here likes it so far or until their project goes red for everyone to see."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Basecamp and the API we are able to leverage existing project data in a new and innovative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and keep up the great work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's a simple step, but it really humanizes things when can you see a person's face next to their words. </p>

<p>Here's how to upload or change the photo that appears next to a person's name:</p>

<p>Select the "My info" link that appears in the upper right of every screen. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page to the section marked "Photo." Then choose the file you want to upload from your computer and click the "Upload photo" button.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.basecamphq.com/help/images/my-info_photo.png" width="499" height="301" alt="add photo" /></p>

<p>You can upload a small photo (GIF, JPG, or PNG), which will be resized to 48 pixels square (if it is not already that size). If you keep seeing an old photo instead of the new photo you've just uploaded, <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache">clear your browser cache</a> and <a href="http://faq.wordpress.com/2006/09/06/force-refresh/">force reload the page</a>.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.highrisehq.com">Highrise</a> users, the process is similar. Just click on "My info" in the upper right of every screen and then select the "Contact and permissions" tab. Then select the "Change photo" link.</p></div>

He writes, "I don't think we'd have been able to even conceive of organizing this without Backpack. It's keeping us completely organized and allowing us to pull off what could be the greatest birthday scavenger hunt of all time!" Full details below, courtesy of Tim.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://backpackit.com" title="Backpack information manager"><img align="left" alt="Backpack" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-backpack.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /></a>For my girlfriend Linda's 29th birthday, I've decided to upgrade her tired old frankenstein'd computer from 2002 to a powerhouse Alienware gaming rig. Additionally, I've set up an "alien conspiracy" theme for the entire birthday. In order to set the mood properly, I've enlisted a few friends and we've designed and are in the process of playing out an alternate reality game with her as the unwitting investigator. The whole thing ends with her old computer being abducted and replaced with the new Alienware machine.</p>

<p>There are a lot of moving parts to an alternate reality game, including some detailed scripts for the plot, a variety of props for everything from letters sent by email to pieces of the puzzle, phone messages that happen on specific days and people who need to be at certain places at certain times. We'd started by sending a few emails around, but it quickly became way too complex for that. So we set up an account on <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> to help us keep everything in check.</p>

<p>Assembling the script on a single page using dividers to organize each stage helped a huge amount, especially during brainstorming sessions where several of us were on the phone talking and writing new notes.</p>

<p>The calendar helped us keep the dates things needed to be prepared by (coded in red), as well as the date of the actual launch of the event (coded in green).</p>

<p>Messages allowed us to note conflicts, scheduling problems (like being away for Thanksgiving here in Canada!) and ensure the people we were using for voicemails and in-person meetings were up to speed on any last-minute changes and general progress.<br />
</p><p><br />
Here's the general storyline: Linda receives a letter in the mail, typed on an antique typewriter, addressed to her directly with only a phone number as the contents. When she calls the number, she gets the voicemail for the W.M. Roswell and Associates law firm, specializing in freedom of information requests and anti-trust law. It directs her to a website. The website contains information about recent cases, as well as information about W.M. and his associates. Several days later, she receives a note included with the bill for dinner, directing her to a meeting that is "key to her safety." A map is provided for where she needs to be and when. She waits there, and one of the associates from the law firm goes up to her, hands her a package, then runs off, looking suspicious. Inside the package are several diary pages making reference to a "device" that's been stolen, a newspaper clipping about the recent unusual death of one of the partners at W.M. Roswell, and several redacted government documents making references to the same device. Additionally, there is an object that is required to solve a puzzle encoded in the diary.</p>

<p>The code provides a password that will allow her to login to the "client only" area of the W.M. Roswell website, providing the "alien reveal" -- that the object in question is of alien origin, and it's been stolen, but one of the associates has a lead on it. This should happen about a week before her birthday proper. Four days after she figures out the puzzle (or the day before her birthday, whichever comes first), an email will be sent to her from W.M. himself saying that the device has been located, and an email will be sent before 9am within the next several days, providing her with information regarding the delivery of the device. The night before her birthday, we'll be taking her out for drinks with friends, to ensure she sleeps soundly. On her birthday, October 25th, while she sleeps, I'll have swapped out her current computer for the new Alienware, and when she goes to check her email in the morning, there it will be, with a happy birthday email in her inbox.</p>

<p>Should be a blast if we manage to pull it off, and don't scare her too much to follow the clues. :-)</p>

<p>Seriously, though: I don't think we'd have been able to even conceive of organizing this without Backpack. It's keeping us completely organized and allowing us to pull off what could be the greatest birthday scavenger hunt of all time!</p>

<p><em>Billy Putrino of <a href="http://versatilityskateboards.com/">Versatility Skateboards</a> on his team's use of <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>:</em></p>

<p><strong>How do you use our products and why do you like them?</strong><br />
Versatility Skateboards is a new skateboard company founded in early 2008. Our company is headed up by three partners and our steadily expanding skate team has seven riders. When we’re not out skating, we virtually work from home. Basecamp and Campfire has enabled us to remain 100% connected with each other.</p>

<p>Basecamp is the body of our business’s communications. Every project, from designing a new skateboard to planning a contest sponsorship, is tracked in Basecamp.</p>

<p>Campfire is our brain. All three of us leave it up and running all day, which allows us the ability to brainstorm at the drop of a hat. The best feature of Campfire is that it’s logged and we can revisit the ideas we discussed 10 minutes, 10 days or 10 weeks later. Without Campfire, a lot of ideas would be lost!</p>

<p><strong>Which features do you use most?</strong><br />
We use Basecamp’s files feature the most. It lets us share board designs, skate pictures, website art and even skate videos; the files feature creates a central location for all these files. It’s so much easier than emailing multiple copies of these files back and forth to each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/files.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="versatility" /></p><p>The comments on to-do lists is another feature we’re constantly using. This feature gives a voice to the tasks on our company’s agenda. It really helps so much to be able to know the status of any given task at any given time.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/todo.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="versatility" /></p>

<p><strong>What did you use before and why did you switch?</strong><br />
We were using email for all our business communications before Basecamp, which got ugly fast. It’s way too difficult to run a business through e-mail. When we began searching for a communication application to use, simplicity and effectiveness were our top priorities – we didn’t want to waste valuable time learning to use an application. Enter Basecamp – virtually no learning curve, easy to use, very effective and beautifully laid out. It fits Versatility and enables us to keep doing what we do.</p>

<p><strong>Get specific. Tell us a story about a project or situation where a 37signals product helped you out.</strong><br />
We are about to create a project in Basecamp called “Team”. We have designated this as an area where our team skaters will have access to post up pictures and videos. They will be able to communicate with each other to setup skate sessions and share trick tips. We also plan on using it to help set-up contest entries for our skaters. “Team” will simply be used to keep us in the know with each team skater. Several of our team skaters are out-of-state, but with Basecamp the location doesn’t matter. We are excited to get our team in Basecamp and watch us all come together as a family. This is the tool to do that!</p>

<p><strong>Any tips or tricks for other customers?</strong><br />
The best tip I can give is to use OpenID to log on. When you use the OpenID to log on, a toolbar appears on top containing all of your 37signals applications allowing you to seamlessly switch between them. It’s so convenient to be able to use all the 37signals applications as if they were one.</p>

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three 37signals tools made the list at &lt;a href="http://www.elearningyellowpages.com/blog/2008/10/ditch-the-backpack-100-essential-web-tools-for-virtual-students/"&gt;Ditch the backpack: 100 essential web tools for virtual students&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what the list is all about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While learning at home offers great opportunities for working on your own time and schedule, it can also offer drawbacks when it comes to working with others or getting immediate help on a problem. Whether you need help, collaboration, or just want a little extra knowledge when completing your assignments, these web tools will help you find what you need. From note taking to researching to staying organized, the following resources will have you making top grades in your classes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are the 37signals tools that made the cut: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://campfirenow.com" title="Campfire group business chat"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Campfire" height="33" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-campfire.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.campfirenow.com"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;. Set up instant chat rooms with your study group or classroom using Campfire and make communicating as a group much easier.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://writeboard.com" title="Writeboard collaborative writing"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Writeboard" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-writeboard.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.writeboard.com"&gt;Writeboard&lt;/a&gt;. Create a web-based text document with this tool, then use it to either edit, share, or send yourself a text file of your document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://backpackit.com" title="Backpack information manager"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Backpack" height="32" src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/logo-small-backpack.gif?1178119891" width="39" style="margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.backpackit.com/"&gt;Backpack&lt;/a&gt;. This tool can organize anything from just your own studies to that of an entire class. Make pages, use calendars, post announcements, get email or text message reminders, and more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today we're excited to unveil an enhancement that makes using <a href="http://www.highrisehq.com">Highrise</a> even more convenient: The sidebar search-for-a-person feature is now significantly faster than before.</p>

<p>Searching for a person or company from the sidebar on the Dashboard or a person/company's page is the most frequently used feature in all of Highrise. Highrise is about getting to a person/company's page so you can enter a note or look up a previous conversation or grab a phone number. Now you can do that a whole lot faster.</p>

<h2>Watch this video to see it in action</h2>

<p>Sam Stephenson, one of our developers here at 37signals, has been working hard to make this a reality. And now that we've launched it, he put together a video showing you the before and after:</p>
