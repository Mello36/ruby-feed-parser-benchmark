The second, Ad revenue slump rips through newspapers , details the dramatic fall-off of advertising in the US over a two-year period. ... The third, A hunch that failed to pay off, predicts that the cost-cutting measures taken by Sam Zell, owner of the US media giant, Tribune Company, which has just filed for bankruptcy protection, &amp;quot;will be copied around the industry.&amp;quot; And the fourth, Consortiums formed in effort to boost digital advertising, tells how leading US newspapers are collaborating to increase online revenues.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;The debate goes back almost two years, if not longer. In March 2007, Google said it would anonymize search records after 24 months to protect privacy, then followed that up a couple months later by agreeing to anonymize the date after 18 months. Just three months ago, with both the US and EU breathing down Google’s neck, the company said it would cut its data retention time down to nine months. But in April of this year, a European Commission advisory panel recommended that the major search engines delete search data after six months. Microsoft’s Live Search currently stores that data for 18 months, while Google and Yahoo store web search records for nine and 13 months, respectively.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

There obviously needs to be some sort of open access policy for scholarship in the humanities, as there already is to a great extent in the sciences.

In these cases, the policies of presses like Continuum ... serve the interests neither of writers nor of readers. I don’t have a blueprint of how to get there (open access) from here (restrictive copyright arrangements), but a first step would be for those academics who, like me, can afford to forgo the lines on their vitas, to refuse to publish with presses that have such policies.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;So much joyful digital stuff is only a pleasure because it&amp;#039;s hugely convenient; quick, free, indoors, no heavy lifting. That&amp;#039;s enabled lovely little thoughts to get out there. But as &amp;#039;digital natives&amp;#039; get more interested in the real world; embedding in it, augmenting it, connecting it, weaponising it, arduinoing it, printing it out, then those thoughts/things need to get better.

&amp;quot;The goal of Portable Contacts is to make it easier for developers to give their users a secure way to access the address books and friends lists they have built up all over the web. Specifically, we seek to create: A common access pattern and contact schema that any site can provide; well-specified authentication and access rules; standard libraries that can work with any site; and absolutely minimal complexity, with the lightest possible toolchain requirements for developers. A measure of our success will be the elimination of the &amp;quot;password anti-pattern,&amp;quot; by making it far easier to implement Portable Contacts than to engage in scraping, as well as a dramatic increase in the number of sites that both provide and consume who-you-know data.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;Should ISPs be censoring web content at all? Although many may agree that the type of content the IWF seek to identify is content that should not be circulated, the fact is that Government are talking ever more loosely about internet “filtering” in other contexts, for example to block unlawful distribution of copyrighted content. This episode has demonstrated the disruptive effect such practices can have even when applied to content of limited appeal. Is this a road we wish to travel down further?

&amp;quot;My biggest mistake (at least in terms of income avoided) was not believing in the world wide web in 1994. ... How many clues were just sitting there, how much access I had, how deliberate I was in ignoring them. Why? I think the answer is simple: Because the rules of this new business didn&amp;#039;t match the rules of my existing business.
Businesses live in ecosystems. A series of rules and assumptions that, taken together, make a thriving mechanism. ... We get stuck because we believe that the rules of our ecosystem are permanent and transferable. In fact, they are almost always temporary and rarely transferable. My approach now is simple: take a look at the rules of the new ecosystem. Do they make sense? Is it possible they&amp;#039;ll come to pass? If they do, what happens to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;It seems in my life that it&amp;#039;s been all about being open to new experiences. Work isn&amp;#039;t a job, it&amp;#039;s a journey full of natural ups and downs - but the best times are the learning times. Pay attention to them when they come along, learning as much as you can along the way - and realize that it&amp;#039;s time to change gears if those times are too few and infrequent.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/google_is_my_doctor/"&gt;Scott Adams: Google Is My Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;My guess is that the Internet could equal your doctor in diagnosing uncommon problems. WebMD for example asks a bunch of diagnostic questions and narrows down your symptoms just as a doctor would. That system will only improve over time. Common problems are even easier to diagnose, give or take someone looking in your ear or down your throat. And I&amp;#039;m imagining someday you can buy a home kit that takes a picture down those orifices and puts it on your computer for easy comparison to stock medical pictures. This leaves us with the issue of dispensing meds. Your first reaction is that obviously you want a doctor to do that because otherwise people will abuse the system or diagnose something deadly for themselves. But perhaps there is another way to approach this safely. ... I don&amp;#039;t have the details worked out, but I think Google will be your new doctor in some fashion.&amp;quot; See http://searchengineland.com/paging-dr-google-will-google-replace-your-doctor-15752.php&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;One of the unstated reasons for the decrease in participation costs ... is the shift from the email inbox -- where the user is consigned to being a file clerk, archiving, &amp;amp; foldering -- and the shift to streaming clients that power users of twitter invariably use. In the streaming client apps, messaging drift by, &amp;amp; fall off the edge. If I want to look, I look; if I want to reply, I reply; in either case, after a while the message falls off the time horizon supported by the tool, &amp;amp; then it is gone, archived in the cloud somewhere, but out of the temporal horizon supported by the tool. ... This pattern drives the cognitive &amp;amp; productivity shifts that streaming tools engender in us &amp;amp; our modes of interaction. This is again that flow state of mind, the flow mode of operation that will soon be the norm.

&amp;quot;So much joyful digital stuff is only a pleasure because it&amp;#039;s hugely convenient; quick, free, indoors, no heavy lifting. That&amp;#039;s enabled lovely little thoughts to get out there. But as &amp;#039;digital natives&amp;#039; get more interested in the real world; embedding in it, augmenting it, connecting it, weaponising it, arduinoing it, printing it out, then those thoughts/things need to get better. And we might all need to acquire some analogue native skills.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://portablecontacts.net/"&gt;Portable Contacts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;The goal of Portable Contacts is to make it easier for developers to give their users a secure way to access the address books and friends lists they have built up all over the web. Specifically, we seek to create: A common access pattern and contact schema that any site can provide; well-specified authentication and access rules; standard libraries that can work with any site; and absolutely minimal complexity, with the lightest possible toolchain requirements for developers. A measure of our success will be the elimination of the &amp;quot;password anti-pattern,&amp;quot; by making it far easier to implement Portable Contacts than to engage in scraping, as well as a dramatic increase in the number of sites that both provide and consume who-you-know data.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;Should ISPs be censoring web content at all? Although many may agree that the type of content the IWF seek to identify is content that should not be circulated, the fact is that Government are talking ever more loosely about internet “filtering” in other contexts, for example to block unlawful distribution of copyrighted content. This episode has demonstrated the disruptive effect such practices can have even when applied to content of limited appeal. Is this a road we wish to travel down further? And if so, what does the final destination look like?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;My biggest mistake (at least in terms of income avoided) was not believing in the world wide web in 1994. ... How many clues were just sitting there, how much access I had, how deliberate I was in ignoring them. Why? I think the answer is simple: Because the rules of this new business didn&amp;#039;t match the rules of my existing business.
Businesses live in ecosystems. A series of rules and assumptions that, taken together, make a thriving mechanism. ... We get stuck because we believe that the rules of our ecosystem are permanent and transferable. In fact, they are almost always temporary and rarely transferable. My approach now is simple: take a look at the rules of the new ecosystem. Do they make sense? Is it possible they&amp;#039;ll come to pass? If they do, what happens to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;It seems in my life that it&amp;#039;s been all about being open to new experiences. Work isn&amp;#039;t a job, it&amp;#039;s a journey full of natural ups and downs - but the best times are the learning times.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/google_is_my_doctor/"&gt;Scott Adams: Google Is My Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;My guess is that the Internet could equal your doctor in diagnosing uncommon problems. WebMD for example asks a bunch of diagnostic questions and narrows down your symptoms just as a doctor would. That system will only improve over time. Common problems are even easier to diagnose, give or take someone looking in your ear or down your throat. And I&amp;#039;m imagining someday you can buy a home kit that takes a picture down those orifices and puts it on your computer for easy comparison to stock medical pictures. This leaves us with the issue of dispensing meds. Your first reaction is that obviously you want a doctor to do that because otherwise people will abuse the system or diagnose something deadly for themselves. But perhaps there is another way to approach this safely. ... I don&amp;#039;t have the details worked out, but I think Google will be your new doctor in some fashion.&amp;quot; See http://searchengineland.com/paging-dr-google-will-google-replace-your-doctor-15752.php&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;One of the unstated reasons for the decrease in participation costs ... is the shift from the email inbox -- where the user is consigned to being a file clerk, archiving, &amp;amp; foldering -- and the shift to streaming clients that power users of twitter invariably use. In the streaming client apps, messaging drift by, &amp;amp; fall off the edge. If I want to look, I look; if I want to reply, I reply; in either case, after a while the message falls off the time horizon supported by the tool, &amp;amp; then it is gone, archived in the cloud somewhere, but out of the temporal horizon supported by the tool. ... This pattern drives the cognitive &amp;amp; productivity shifts that streaming tools engender in us &amp;amp; our modes of interaction. This is again that flow state of mind, the flow mode of operation that will soon be the norm. And the premises of asymmetric relationships &amp;amp; tools, &amp;amp; the ubiquity of that model of social interaction are a foundation of this shift we are undergoing, collectively &amp;amp; individually.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;Lechner researched the typical distance between a viewer and their television screen by taking measurements in many American homes. The median distance complied from all his data came out to 9 feet. This measurement is now called the Lechner distance. Your viewing distance based on Lechner’s analysis is very likely to be 9 feet. There are two standard HD broadcast resolutions 720 lines and 1080 lines. The following are the minimum screen sizes that will let your eyes resolve all the detail at the Lechner distance, one for each HD broadcast resolution. For a 720p display it’s a 46” screen size. For 1080i or 1080p display it’s a whopping 69”screen. All screen measurements are diagonal inches. A smaller display for each given resolution will not allow your eyes to perceive all the detail that appears in HDTV.&amp;quot; via Olly&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;Twitter has raised $20 million from venture capitalists, but has brought in virtually no revenue, choosing growth over everything else. Indeed, Mr. Williams said he had planned to raise more capital in mid-2009 and wait to worry about revenue until 2010. ... Mr. Williams said that Twitter gets daily calls from companies who want to pay for sponsorships, but it plans to avoid making money from ads. Instead, it will figure out a way to charge businesses who use Twitter to talk with customers or sell products. Companies like JetBlue Airways, Dell and Whole Foods Market have used Twitter in these ways. So far, though, “we haven’t studied the business cases much,” he said. “We literally have no business people in the company, so this isn’t an area we’re really focused on.”&amp;quot; via Ben, http://blog.benhammersley.com/post/63357250/why-twitter-turned-down-facebook-bits-blog&lt;/li&gt;

It took three hours and went smoothly; Professor Thomas&amp;#039; text was absolutely spot on. ... &amp;quot;Start on clavicle. Remove middle third. Control and divide subsc art and vein. Divide large nerve trunks around these as prox as poses. Then come onto chest wall immed anterior and divide Pec maj origin from remaining clav. Divide pec minor insertion and (very imp) divide origin and get deep to serrates anterior. Your hand sweeps behind scapula. Divide all muscles attached to scapula. Stop muscle bleeding with count suture. Easy! Good luck. Meirion&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;Lechner researched the typical distance between a viewer and their television screen by taking measurements in many American homes. The median distance complied from all his data came out to 9 feet. This measurement is now called the Lechner distance. Your viewing distance based on Lechner’s analysis is very likely to be 9 feet. There are two standard HD broadcast resolutions 720 lines and 1080 lines. The following are the minimum screen sizes that will let your eyes resolve all the detail at the Lechner distance, one for each HD broadcast resolution. For a 720p display it’s a 46” screen size. For 1080i or 1080p display it’s a whopping 69”screen. All screen measurements are diagonal inches. A smaller display for each given resolution will not allow your eyes to perceive all the detail that appears in HDTV.&amp;quot; via Olly&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;You know how when you were in college you kept wondering how your professors got so WEIRD? They all seemed to have their own unique brand of quirk, a penchant for collecting something random, and a twitch that made it clear that interacting with humans was not quite their speed. They don&amp;#039;t tell you this when you start your PhD, but this is a product of academification. It is caused by long years of jumping through hoops, complete isolation/alienation, and the pressure to be brilliant.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;Twitter has raised $20 million from venture capitalists, but has brought in virtually no revenue, choosing growth over everything else. Indeed, Mr. Williams said he had planned to raise more capital in mid-2009 and wait to worry about revenue until 2010. ... Mr. Williams said that Twitter gets daily calls from companies who want to pay for sponsorships, but it plans to avoid making money from ads. Instead, it will figure out a way to charge businesses who use Twitter to talk with customers or sell products. Companies like JetBlue Airways, Dell and Whole Foods Market have used Twitter in these ways. So far, though, “we haven’t studied the business cases much,” he said. “We literally have no business people in the company, so this isn’t an area we’re really focused on.”&amp;quot; via Ben, http://blog.benhammersley.com/post/63357250/why-twitter-turned-down-facebook-bits-blog&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;quot;#hohoto is shaping up to be a good-works good-time for all. It’s using the digital media we love so well to organize (in a bottom up way with scare quotes around it) a real world charitable event and party that will also push back out into the digital world. All the money goes to the Food Bank. You have to love the way in which Twitter, which seems like the most evanescent means of communication since the polite nod, is enabling our deepest need to connect. From Twitter to community to social responsibility. +1 all around.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

One of the books I then read over the break was &lt;a title="Amazon UK" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/0713999896" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here Comes Everybody&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been meaning for some time to put down a few notes about it here. This has grown to be a long post as I’ve added to it, wanting to get a few things out on the page and, so, clearer in my own mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a great book to suggest to friends who are not familiar with the technologies Shirky discusses as it hides its knowledge well — but there are still leads to follow up. The modest ten or so pages of the Bibliography threw up a number of articles I'd either not heard of before or hadn’t visited in a long while. In the former camp, I recommend: &lt;a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/bblonder/phys120/docs/anderson.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Anderson: More Is Different (&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; — 1972)&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;R H Coase: The Nature of the Firm (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; — a 1937 economics paper; &lt;a href="http://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html" target="_blank"&gt;Richard P. Gabriel — Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big: worse is better&lt;/a&gt; (1991); &lt;a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/relmodov.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Alan Page Fiske: Human Sociality&lt;/a&gt;. (There’s an online “webliography” &lt;a title="my mind on books: Complete “Webibliography” for ‘Here Comes Everybody’ by Clay Shirky" href="http://mymindonbooks.com/?page_id=562" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) And chapters 8–11, covering so many big topics — social capital; three kinds of loss (some solve-a-hard-problem jobs; some social bargains; negative aspects to new freedoms); small world networks; more on social capital; failure (‘open source … is outfailing’ commercial efforts, 245); more on groups (‘every working system is a mix of social and technological factors’, 260) — hit my Amazon Prime account hard. (Incidentally, there’s a Kevin Kelly piece on “more is different”, &lt;a title="The Technium, 17 April, 2008" href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/04/zillionics.php" target="_blank"&gt;Zillionics&lt;/a&gt;, that appeared earlier this year. See also Kevin Kelly’s &lt;a title="The Technium, 28 June, 2008" href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/the_google_way.php" target="_blank"&gt;The Google Way of Science&lt;/a&gt; and Wired’s &lt;a title="Wired, 23 June, 2008" href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_intro" target="_blank"&gt;The Petabyte Age: Because More Isn't Just More — More Is Different&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Further reading to one side, a number of things discussed in the book particularly interested me straightaway. Firstly, &lt;strong&gt;sociality, privacy and exposure&lt;/strong&gt; online. Leisa recently posted &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/disambiguity/~3/264736036/" target="_blank"&gt;Ambient Exposure&lt;/a&gt;, an update (of sorts) to her post of last March, &lt;a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/ambient-intimacy/" target="_blank"&gt;Ambient Intimacy&lt;/a&gt;. The titles tell their own story. Early on, Clay writes about ‘how dramatically connected we've become to one another … [how much] information we give off about our selves’. This took me back to Adam Greenfield’s recent talk at the &lt;a title="From computers to ubiquitous computing, by 2020 (17–18 March, 2008)" href="http://royalsociety.org/event.asp?id=6065" target="_blank"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; (I’ve also been re-reading &lt;em&gt;Everyware&lt;/em&gt;). Our love of &lt;a title="a (very long) conversation with dopplr’s matt jones: &amp;quot;And we do flock well&amp;quot;" href="http://secondverse.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/a-very-long-conversation-with-dopplrs-matt-jones/" target="_blank"&gt;flocking&lt;/a&gt; is being fed handsomely by means of the new tools Clay Shirky discusses so well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Privacy is always coming up in conversations at school about online life, and what I’m hearing suggests our students are beginning to look at privacy and exposure with growing circumspection. Facebook’s &lt;a title="Facebook blog, 2008" href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=15610312130" target="_blank"&gt;People You May Know&lt;/a&gt; functionality has made some sit up and wonder where social software might be taking us. We’re slowly acquiring a stronger sense of how seduction through &lt;em&gt;imagined&lt;/em&gt; privacy works (alone in a room, save for screen and keyboard) and a more developed understanding of what it means to write for unseen audiences. Meanwhile, there are things to be &lt;em&gt;unlearned&lt;/em&gt;: ‘those of us who grew up with a strong separation between communication and broadcast media … assume that if something is out where we can find it, it must have been written for us. … Now that the cost of posting things in a global medium has collapsed, much of what gets posted on any given day is in public but not for the public’ (90).  In the Bibliography, Clay refers to &lt;a title="We'll learn a kind of tolerance for the private conversation that is not aimed at us …" href="http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2003/10/13#1066058820" target="_blank"&gt;a post of Danny O’Brien’s&lt;/a&gt; — all about &lt;em&gt;register &lt;/em&gt;— which is a longtime favourite of mine, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Then there was what the book had to say about &lt;strong&gt;media and journalism&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a title="On reading Clay Shirky’s ‘Here comes everybody’" href="http://www.simonwaldman.net/2008/03/07/on-reading-clay-shirkys-here-comes-everybody/" target="_blank"&gt;Simon Waldman&lt;/a&gt;, well-placed to pass comment, on chapters 3 and 4:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The chapters most relevant to media/journalism - ‘Everyone is a media outlet’ and ‘Publish first, filter later’ should be required reading for pretty much everyone currently sitting in a newspaper/broadcaster. It’s certainly the best thought through thing I’ve read on this, and the comparison to the decline of the scribes when the printing press came in is really well drawn.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;The summary to Chapter 4 (‘Publish, Then Filter’) runs, ‘The media landscape is transformed, because personal communication and publishing, previously separate functions, now shade into one another. One result is to break the older pattern of professional filtering of the good from the mediocre before publication; now such filtering is increasingly social, and happens after the fact’. ‘Filter-then-publish … rested on a scarcity of media that is a thing of the past. The expansion of social media means the only working system is publish-then-filter’ (98). (Language like this can sound an utopian note that rings on in the head long after the book’s been closed, as if we’d entered a world beyond old constraints. And &lt;a title="Robert McCrum: 'The word, written and spoken ... has been handed back whence it came, from the few to the many. ... the opportunities for the digital book are almost unimaginable'" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,,2282065,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;look!&lt;/a&gt;: the Praetorian Guard of elite gatekeepers is no more.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;I was interested, too, to read Shirky’s thoughts about &lt;strong&gt;the impact of new technologies on institutions&lt;/strong&gt;. His application of Ronald Coase’s 1937 paper and, in particular, the idea of the Coasean floor (‘activities … [that] are valuable to someone but too expensive to be taken on in any institutional way’), was very striking: the new tools allow ‘serious, complex work [to be] taken on without institutional direction’ and things can now be achieved by ‘loosely coordinated groups’ which previously ‘lay under the Coasean floor’.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We didn't notice how many things were under that floor because, prior to the current era, the alternative to institutional action was usually no action. (47)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Later in the book (107), he comes back to institutions, taking what is happening to media businesses as not unique but prophetic — for ‘All businesses are media businesses … [as] all businesses rely on the managing of information for two audiences — employees and the world’: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The increase in the power of both individuals and groups, outside traditional organisational structures, is unprecedented. Many institutions we rely on today will not survive this change without significant alteration, and the more an institution or industry relies on information as its core product, the greater and more complete the change will be. The linking of symmetrical participation and amateur production makes this period of change remarkable. Symmetrical participation means that once people have the capacity to receive information, they have the capability to send it as well. Owning a television does not give you the ability to make TV shows, but owning a computer means that you can create as well as receive many kinds of content, from the written word through sound and images. Amateur production, the result of all this new capability, means that the category of "consumer" is now a temporary behaviour rather than a permanent identity.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;‘Every new user is a potential creator and consumer’ (106) is reminiscent of Bradley Horowitz in &lt;a href="http://www.elatable.com/blog/2006/02/17/creators-synthesizers-and-consumers/" target="_blank"&gt;Creators, Synthesizers, and Consumers&lt;/a&gt; (2006). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div align="justify"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope.&lt;/strong&gt; At the ICA, Clay said that he is no longer a cyber-utopian (he’s said this on numerous other occasions, too: eg, see David Weinberger’s &lt;a title="Clay Shirky’s book talk: &amp;quot;thinking this isn’t a side effect of the Net. It was an effect&amp;quot;" href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2008/02/28/clay-shirkys-book-talk/" target="_blank"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; on Shirky’s &lt;a title="Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations (Event Video/Audio)" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/interactive/events/2008/02/shirky" target="_blank"&gt;talk at the Berkman Center&lt;/a&gt;), and in the book he addresses this directly, in the context of institutions and their value:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This is not to say that corporations and governments are going to wither away. Though some of the early utopianism around new communications tools suggested that we were heading into some sort of post-hierarchical paradise, that's not what's happening now and it's not going to happen. None of the absolute advantages of institutions like businesses or schools or governments have disappeared. Instead, what has happened is that most of the &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; advantages of those institutions have disappeared — relative, that is, to the direct effect of the people they represent. (23)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Compare what he said last June about &lt;a title="Britannica Blog: Old Revolutions, Good; New Revolutions, Bad" href="http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2007/06/old-revolutions-good-new-revolutions-bad/" target="_blank"&gt;expertise&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Critically, this expansion of freedom has not undermined any of the absolute advantages of expertise; the virtues of mastery remain as they were. What has happened is that the relative advantages of expertise are in precipitous decline.’ And here he is, in the book, talking about youth: ‘young people are taking better advantage of social tools, extending their capabilities in ways that violate old models not because they know more useful things than we do but because they know fewer useless things than we do. I’m old enough to know a lot of things just from life experience. … In the last fifteen years I’ve had to unlearn every one of those things and a million others, because they have stopped being true. … My students … don’t have to unlearn those things, because they have never had to learn them in the first place. The advantage of youth, however, is relative, not absolute’, 303–4.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cyber-utopian he may not be, but there’s plenty of &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; and idealism here (and I’m not using ‘idealism’ negatively). The section (chapter 5) focusing on Wikipedia, ‘perhaps the most famous example of distributed collaboration today’, which was very helpful to have to hand whilst writing the material for our first year’s course on Wikipedia (see &lt;a title="23: Wikipedia I" href="http://preoccupations.jot.com/WikiHome/Lesson%2023" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="24: Wikipedia II" href="http://preoccupations.jot.com/WikiHome/Lesson%2024" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), extols a living process of editorial composition (‘process not product, always unfinished’, 119) in a project that feels new to many of us but &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; to my 14 year-old students (it’s half as old as they are). The faith Clay shows here is inspiring, even if I come away thinking that we still have a lot to learn about how Wikipedia works. (And as for how it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; work …)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Highlighted bits of this chapter for me include, memorably, ‘a wiki is a hybrid of tool and community … [it] augments community rather than replacing it’ (136, 137). I like that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social tools: g&lt;strong&gt;roup action just got easier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In his &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/interactive/events/2008/02/shirky" target="_blank"&gt;talk at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, Shirky sets out very clearly, within the first few minutes of speaking, the momentousness of what the web is enabling: ‘we’re living through the largest increase in human expressive capability in history’. He singles out four other revolutions which compete with this: the invention of the printing press and movable type (taken as a broad period of innovation); the telegraph and the telephone (again, taken as one broad period); recorded media of all types — images, sound, moving images, moving images &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sound; broadcast (images and sound). He notes the curious asymmetry here: of these four, the ones that create groups don’t create two-way communication, and the ones that create two-way communication don’t create groups. Either you had broadcasting/publishing (eg, TV, magazine), where the broadcast was from centre-to-edge and the relationship was between producer and consumer (one-to-many); or you had the telephone — two-way conversation, but no group (one-to-one). And then there’s now. We have a network that is ‘natively good at group forming’ (many-to-many). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much of this is also found in the book (106–7).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier days.&lt;/strong&gt; I came to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; use (ie, read &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; write to) the web when I started blogging, in November 2003. Compared to savvier friends, this is very recent and, consequently, I’m glad for those parts in the book where Clay talks a little about the history of web and net. For example, in Chapter 4 he discusses the ‘early days of weblogs (prior to 2002, roughly)’ when ‘there was a remarkable and loose-jointed conversation among webloggers of all stripes’, when ‘weblogging was mainly an interactive pursuit’ (which perhaps explains something of what Doc Searls is &lt;a title="Blogging today ain’t what it was …" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/04/06/what-comes-after-blogging/" target="_blank"&gt;missing in blogging today&lt;/a&gt;). He’s good on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="OED entry" href="https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=ad6vvc428w8_114cfzpx5d5&amp;amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank"&gt;cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: ‘The idea of cyberspace made sense when the population of the internet had a few million users; in that world social relations online really were separate from offline ones … an accident of partial adoption. Though the internet began to function in its earliest form in 1969, it was not until 1999 that any country had a majority of its citizens online. … In the developed world, the experience of the average twenty-five year-old is one of substantial overlap between online and offline friends and colleagues. The overlap is so great … both the word and the concept of “cyberspace” have fallen into disuse. The internet augments real-world social life rather than providing an alternative to it. Instead of becoming a separate cyberspace, our electronic networks are becoming deeply embedded in real life’ (195–6).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The note to page 281 is a glimpse back into the world of Usenet: ‘one of the three great global experiments in social tools prior to the invention of the Web. (The other two were e-mail discussion lists and online communities such as the WELL and ECHO.) At the height of its popularity in 1994, usenet was at the core of most users' experience of the internet’.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other bits I enjoyed: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘A profession exists to solve a hard problem … [and] becomes, for its members, a way of understanding their world’ (57–8). Most ‘exist because there is a scarce resource that requires ongoing management’ (57) and its ‘members have a tendency to equate provisional solutions to particular problems with deep truths about the world’ (59). Then, with new technologies, the profession that seemed ‘like a fixed and abiding category … turns out to be tied to an accidental scarcity’ (76).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Two things are true about the remaking of the European intellectual landscape during the Protestant Reformation: first, it was not caused by the invention of movable type, and second, it was possible only after the invention of movable type’ (67).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘small group communications and large broadcast outlets all exist as part of a single interconnected ecosystem’ (99). ‘When people talk about user-generated content, they are describing ways that users create and share media with one another, with no professionals anywhere in sight. Seen this way, the idea of user-generated-content is actually not just a personal theory of creative capabilities but a social theory of media relations.’ (83)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Every web page is a latent community.’ (102)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Communications tools don’t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. … a tool … has to have been around long enough that most of society is using it. It’s when a technology becomes normal, then ubiquitous, and finally so pervasive as to be invisible, that the really profound changes happen, and for young people today, our new social tools have passed normal and are heading to ubiquitous, and invisible is coming.’ (105)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘What we are witnessing today is a difference in the degree of sharing so large it becomes a difference in kind.’ (149)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘social tools don’t create collective action — they merely remove the obstacles to it. … This is why many of the significant changes are based … on simple, easy-to-use tools like email, mobile phones and websites, because these are the tools most people have access to and … are comfortable using in their daily lives’ (159–60).

Its argument needs no rehearsing here. The criticism of TV — as a mask for the cognitive surplus, as something watched mindlessly and passively — is bound up with an apparent attitude to consumption that has itself been criticised effectively by (for example) Chris in his post, &lt;a title="antimega: There’s also a weird anti-consumption spin" href="http://antimega.textdriven.com/antimega/2008/04/28/everything-ie-anything" target="_blank"&gt;everything i.e. anything&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Nothing is worth creating if it isn’t consumed (yes, yes, there’s gain in the process of making, or craft, also). … It would be great if people did create more, and especially felt empowered to create, change, edit, curate, but we can’t expect them to do that without consumption and reflection’. (See also Tom’s &lt;a title="Infovore" href="http://infovore.org/archives/2008/05/01/consumption-is-also-about-choice/" target="_blank"&gt;Consumption is also about choice&lt;/a&gt;: ‘the world Shirky describes as preferable to the constant passivity of TV is not one of constant production, constant creation, but one where “passive” and “engaged” are two ends of a sliding scale - and that it’s the inner of that scale, not the edges, that is most commonly inhabited’.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(In fact, I don’t think Clay &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; anti-consumption, but the language he uses can, again, create an after-effect that isn’t justified by the full text: ‘media is actually a triathlon, it's three different events. People like to consume, but they also like to produce, and they like to share’.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And TV? Was watching it always such a lonely, passive thing? As &lt;a title="Technovia: Nicholas Carr, Clay Shirky, and the web as liberation" href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:http://www.technovia.co.uk/2008/05/nicholas-carr-clay-shirky-and-the-web-as-liberation.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; points out, until multiple sets appeared in homes watching TV was a &lt;em&gt;family &lt;/em&gt;affair. (That could, and did, cut both ways. I came to find family viewing frequently oppressive.) This is a good place to recall something &lt;a title="1 November 2006, WarrenEllis.com" href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=3234" target="_blank"&gt;Warren Ellis&lt;/a&gt; wrote back in 2006:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Nigel Kneale died today, at the age of 84. Best known for his creation of the four QUATERMASS serials, Nigel Kneale, along with producer Rudolph Cartier, essentially invented adult science fiction and horror on television. He was also a clever and sensitive adapter of other works for tv, such as 1984 and LOOK BACK IN ANGER, and a brutal and pioneering satirist in his plays for television, perhaps most famously for his YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS, predicting the “Big Brother” shows from 1968. ... It’s hard to imagine, now, the impact that the first three QUATERMASS stories had. For six weeks, the country would go home on QUATERMASS night. Pubs would empty out. In those early days of television, an unapologetically adult, complex and weird piece of speculative fiction was common culture. When tv people in the States tell me that the masses “just don’t get” science fiction, this is what I tell them: that before the cast of THE X-FILES was even born, Britain used to shut down on QUATERMASS night, and it’s all people would talk about the next day.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;And that was down to Nigel Kneale, last of a generation of writers for British television who were determined that this common culture should always be entertaining, intelligent, challenging and groundbreaking.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a title="last night I experienced a water cooler moment as a programme was being broadcast ... thanks to Twitter" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2008/05/tv_becomes_social_again.html" target="_blank"&gt;Can social tools make TV social again?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="Could this be the first time anything interesting has ever emerged from the Eurovision Song Contest?" href="http://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2008/05/28/5153" target="_blank"&gt;The Twitter backchannel&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My own memory of TV from my childhood is so close to &lt;a title="&amp;quot;The end of the twentieth century … When we started to get interactivity back&amp;quot;" href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html" target="_blank"&gt;Douglas Adams’ view of it&lt;/a&gt; (‘during this century we have for the first time been dominated by &lt;i&gt;non&lt;/i&gt;-interactive forms of entertainment’) I want to try very hard not to overlook what television did, and can still, achieve. (&lt;a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:http://www.technovia.co.uk/2008/05/nicholas-carr-clay-shirky-and-the-web-as-liberation.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; again: ‘I’d take issue with the whole idea of TV programmes as something monolithic and deadening. “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage" target="_blank"&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;”, deadening? “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_earth" target="_blank"&gt;Life on Earth&lt;/a&gt;”? “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilisation:_A_Personal_View" target="_blank"&gt;Civilisation&lt;/a&gt;”? TV can be massively inspirational’). Everyone should &lt;a title="Speech Given in London, Wednesday 7 May 2008" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/thefuture/transcript_fry.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;read Stephen Fry on the future of public service broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/thefuture/video_fry.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/thefuture/audio_fry.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt;). Describing his TV during his school years, ‘a cultural revolution of astounding depth, variety, imagination and dynamism’, he concludes:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many of us are likely, whatever our professions, to have an attachment to the kind of broadcasting we grew up with, a fierce pride in the staggering history of quality and innovation that has characterized British television and radio for fifty years.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for Clay’s talk, I think Ed Cone has it right in his comment on Nick Carr's &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/05/gilligans_web_1.php" target="_blank"&gt;Gilligan’s web&lt;/a&gt; (comment dated May 16, 2008 09:05 AM):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Clay made a clever if hyperbolic argument about the creativity unleashed by the web. Nick wittily pointed out some of the hyperbole -- but one needn't be a kool-aid drinking web theologizer to recognize the cleverer parts of Clay's argument. So, yes: on the scale of world-healing goodness to which we all so clearly aspire, giving blood to the homeless trumps contributing an article to Wikipedia, which may have more social value than watching Gilligan's Island, which itself is roughly equivalent to giggling at lolcats or pursuing this particular thread much further.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Enough. I’ll be commending and recommending Clay’s talk for a long time to come. He’s a born, and inspiring, story-teller who knows how to exhort and you need to take this in that spirit:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Here’s something four-year-olds know: A screen that ships without a mouse ships broken. Here’s something four-year-olds know: Media that’s targeted at you but doesn’t include you may not be worth sitting still for. Those are things that make me believe that this is a one-way change. Because four year olds, the people who are soaking most deeply in the current environment … just assume that media includes consuming, producing and sharing. … &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;when people ask me what we’re doing … that’s what I’m going to tell them: We’re looking for the mouse. We’re going to look at every place that a reader or a listener or a viewer or a user has been locked out, has been served up passive or a fixed or a canned experience, and ask ourselves, “If we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus and deploy it here, could we make a good thing happen?” And I'm betting the answer is yes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whither?&lt;/strong&gt; 2005, &lt;a title="TED: Larry Lessig calls law professor Yochai Benkler &amp;quot;the leading intellectual of the information age&amp;quot;" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers/view/id/223" target="_blank"&gt;Yochai Benkler&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a title="TED video" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/247" target="_blank"&gt;Open-source economics&lt;/a&gt;, ‘explains how collaborative projects like Wikipedia and Linux represent the next stage of human organization. By disrupting traditional economic production, copyright law and established competition, they're paving the way for a new set of economic laws, where empowered individuals are put on a level playing field with industry giants’.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;My belief is that Wikipedia’s success dramatizes … a change in the nature of authority, moving from trust inhering in guarantees offered by institutions to probabilities created by processes. — Clay Shirky, &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;a title="Many-to-Many" href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/09/18/larry_sanger_citizendium_and_the_problem_of_expertise.php" target="_blank"&gt;Larry Sanger, Citizendium, and the Problem of Expertise&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2006)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This is new. We have never before had a single platform which could scale from conversation to broadcast and all points between, but social media gives us that -- it's like your telephone could turn into a radio, depending on how you configured it. The internet is in a way the first thing that really deserves the label ‘media’. It is a truly general-purpose mediating layer, one that can hold multiple types of content, created and distributed for a huge variety of reasons and in a huge variety of ways, ways that can’t be fit into the old mode of “content”, where one group creates and another merely consumes. What I’ve discovered both as a participant and observer of social uses of media is that no one pattern of use is as interesting as the incredible flexibility and re-combinability of all the patterns together … — &lt;a title="Special Guest Post - Why User-generated Content Mostly Isn't" href="http://thepenguinblog.typepad.com/the_penguin_blog/2008/01/special-guest-p.html" target="_blank"&gt;Clay Shirky, at the Penguin blog&lt;/a&gt; (2008)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Prior to the Internet, the last technology that had any real effect on the way people sat down and talked together was the table. There was no technological mediation for group conversations. The closest we got was the conference call, which never really worked right – “Hello? Do I push this button now? Oh, shoot, I just hung up.” It’s not easy to set up a conference call, but it’s very easy to email five of your friends and say “Hey, where are we going for pizza?” So ridiculously easy group forming is really news.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;We’ve had social software for 40 years at most, dated from the Plato BBS system, and we’ve only had 10 years or so of widespread availability, so we’re just finding out what works. We’re still learning how to make these kinds of things. — &lt;a title="A speech at ETech, April, 2003" href="http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Clay Shirky: A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy&lt;/a&gt; (2003)&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Our future can be kept generative only if we can continue to see the Internet’s invitation to be participants in its use, rather than consumers of it. The path forward is illuminated by the coupling of technological tools – like wikis – that have promoted openness, with social customs and law – like those of Wikipedia – that solicit people to take an active part in building the world they want, rather than simply paying for it and expecting others to do the rest. — &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://publius.cc/2008/05/15/jonathan-zittrain-the-future-of-the-internet-%E2%80%93-and-how-to-stop-it/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: The Future of the Internet – And How to Stop It&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;(2008)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To put this metaphorically, we are not driving a car, with gas, brakes, reverse and a lot of choice as to route.

&lt;p&gt;The diagram comes from John Gourville’s paper, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml;jsessionid=PNFVGMWT4BGAMAKRGWDR5VQBKE0YIISW?id=4516&amp;amp;referral=2341" title="Harvard Business Publishing"&gt;Eager Sellers and Stony Buyers&lt;/a&gt; (2006), and is one iteration of what he calls the 9x problem. I’d not come across &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;amp;facEmId=jgourville" title="Albert J. Weatherhead, Jr. Professor of Business Administration (HBS)"&gt;Gourville’s work&lt;/a&gt; until yesterday, when I read Andrew McAfee’s 2006 post, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/the_9x_email_problem/" title="Harvard Business School"&gt;The 9X Email Problem&lt;/a&gt;. Andrew’s post is so good, I hope I may be forgiven for reblogging a substantial part of it here:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;A while back I heard &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://dor.hbs.edu/fi_redirect.jhtml?facInfo=bio&amp;amp;facEmId=jgourville"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;John Gourville&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, a colleague in HBS's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hbs.edu/units/marketing/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Marketing department&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, talk about his research investigating why so many new consumer products fail to catch on with their intended audiences despite the clear advantages they offer over what's currently on the market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;His explanation was fascinating, and very insightful.&amp;nbsp; He said that we need to stop thinking about consumers as highly rational evaluators of the old vs. the new products, lining up pros and cons of each in mental tables and then selecting the winner.&amp;nbsp; Instead, we need to keep in mind three well-documented features of our cognitive 'equipment' for making evaluations.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;We make relative evaluations, not absolute ones.&amp;nbsp; When I'm at a poker table deciding whether to call a bet, I don't think of what my total net worth will be if I win the hand vs. if I lose it.&amp;nbsp; Instead, I think in relative terms --&amp;nbsp; whether I'll be 'up' or 'down.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Our reference point is the status quo.&amp;nbsp; My poker table comparisons are made with respect to where I am at that point in time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;If I win this hand I'll be up $40; if I lose it I'll be down $10 compared to my current bankroll.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; It's only at the end of the night that my horizon broadens enough to see if I'm up or down for the whole game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;We are loss averse.&amp;nbsp; A $50 loss looms larger than a $50 gain.&amp;nbsp; Loss aversion is virtually universal across people and contexts, and is not much affected by how much wealth one already has.&amp;nbsp; Ample research has demonstrated that people find that a prospective loss of $x is about two to three times as painful as a prospective gain of $x is pleasurable.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;When combined, these three lead to what the behavioral economist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://gsbportal.chicagogsb.edu/portal//server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_314_215_0_43/http%3B/gsbportal.chicagogsb.edu/Facultycourse/Portlet/FacultyDetail.aspx?&amp;amp;min_year=20064&amp;amp;max_year=20073&amp;amp;person_id=31455"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Richard Thaler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt; has called the &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;endowment effect:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; We value items in our possession more than prospective items that could be in our possession, especially if the prospective item is a proposed substitute.&amp;nbsp; We mentally compare having the prospective item to giving up what we already have (our 'endowment'), but because we're loss averse giving up what we already have (our reference point) looms large.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;And Gourville points out three factors that make the situation worse for product developers who want their offerings to succeed.&amp;nbsp; First is timing:&amp;nbsp; adopters have to give up their endowment immediately, and only get benefits sometime in the future.&amp;nbsp; Second, these benefits are not certain; the new product might not work as promised.&amp;nbsp; Third, benefits are usually qualitative, making them difficult to enumerate and compare.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;As if all this weren't enough, Gourville also highlights that the people developing new products are very dissimilar from the products' prospective consumers.&amp;nbsp; You don't go work for TiVo (to use his example) if you don't 'get' the potential of digital video recorders and think they're a really good idea.&amp;nbsp; And after working for the company for a while, having TiVo becomes part of your endowment; you think of things in comparison to TiVo, instead of in comparison to a VCR.&amp;nbsp; Both of these factors make it harder for developers to see things as their target customers do.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Because of all of the above, Gourville talks about the '9X problem' --&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;a mismatch of 9 to 1 between what innovators think consumers want and what consumers actually want.&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; The 9X problem goes a long way to explaining the tech industry folk wisdom that to spread like wildfire a new product has to offer a tenfold improvement over what's currently out there.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; …&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Email is virtually everyone's current endowment of collaboration software.&amp;nbsp; Gourville's research suggests that the average person will underweight the prospective benefits of a replacement technology for it by about a factor of three, and overweight by the same factor everything they're being asked to give up by not using email.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This is the 9X problem developers of new collaboration technologies will have to overcome.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

    <content type="text/html" xml:lang="en-GB" xml:base="http://www.preoccupations.org/" mode="escaped">&lt;p&gt;Adam Foulds came in to school on Thursday and read from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Amazon UK" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Broken-Word-Adam-Foulds/dp/0224084445/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1213530000&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;The Broken Word&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; review &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/poetry/article3766805.ece" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2272901,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Earlier this term, I read the poem in one sitting: it’s not difficult to do this, but it was, in any case, simply not a poem I wanted to break off from reading. It is very disturbing, not least because of the contrast between the quality of the telling and what it has to tell. Hearing so much of it read affected me greatly and, in winding up the reading, I slipped and called Adam ‘Robin’ — as his reading had melded in my mind with &lt;a title="Contemporary Writers: Robin Robertson" href="http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth519D193A0f10922310PmV1BB2F7F" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Robertson&lt;/a&gt;’s also dark reading from earlier in the term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adam talked afterwards about the &lt;em&gt;LRB&lt;/em&gt; review which lies behind the poem. You need a subscription, but the review, &lt;a title="LRB, 3 March 2005" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n05/port01_.html" target="_blank"&gt;Bernard Porter: How did they get away with it?&lt;/a&gt;, discussed two books, David Anderson’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Amazon UK" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Histories-Hanged-Britains-Dirty-Empire/dp/0297847198/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1213545398&amp;amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank"&gt;Histories of the Hanged: Britain’s Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and Caroline Elkins’ &lt;a title="Amazon UK" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britains-Gulag-Brutal-Empire-Kenya/dp/022407363X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1213545493&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Britain’s Gulag: The Brutal End of Empire in Kenya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Adam spoke about how Porter’s review, and then the two books themselves, shook the sense he had grown up with that, on the whole, and despite some shortcomings, British colonial rule had been a good thing. He had, he said, shared the ambient complacency about British rule. Porter’s review put it like this: “The accepted view of Britain’s decolonisation hitherto has been that it was done in a more dignified, enlightened and consensual way than by other countries – meaning, of course, France. It will be difficult now to argue this so glibly.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ambient complacency&lt;/em&gt; is a potent phrase, is it not?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Something else — unrelated — that Adam said after the reading also struck me: novels ‘take a group effort’. (His previous book is a novel, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Amazon UK" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Truth-About-These-Strange-Times/dp/0297852736/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1213552097&amp;amp;sr=1-3" target="_blank"&gt;The Truth About These Strange Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.) They are so long — they can grow so ‘thin and wispy’ — a writer needs the collaboration of others to bring a novel into the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, every author is different. Writing in &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Book of Books &lt;/em&gt;(a slim volume, given away free with the paper in May this year) about how he works as an editor (and drawing on his lengthy experience in &lt;a title="Guardian profile, 29 March 2008" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/poetry/features/0,,2269067,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;), Robin made just this point. His short piece should be read in full, but I can’t find it online. Here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;… an editor’s eye shouldn’t pass over a text too often for fear of losing the very objectivity the writer lacks. During a first read … I’m always watching myself for the first signs of inattention; any time that I’m stopped or distracted means there’s probably a problem in the text … If any changes do need to be made, I’d always ask the author to make them. After all, it is their book, and at this stage it’s still a thing in flux … You have to encourage the writer to see the problem, not just tell them there is one. Editing is about reading and listening attentively … I’ve always considered editing to involve quite a large degree of pastoral care.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:1bf42236-333a-454f-a2fe-d7f814196cf5" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Adam+Foulds" rel="tag"&gt;Adam Foulds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Kenya" rel="tag"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/British+Empire" rel="tag"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/editing" rel="tag"&gt;editing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/writing" rel="tag"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Robin+Robertson" rel="tag"&gt;Robin Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/attention" rel="tag"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/reading" rel="tag"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

    <content type="text/html" xml:lang="en-GB" xml:base="http://www.preoccupations.org/" mode="escaped">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been remiss in writing up recent conferences, but I’m no longer sure that’s a bad thing. Instead of a summary that then, it seems, gets put away in my memory (here or elsewhere), I find I’m going back to things I’ve heard said, presentations made — and circling and circling. It seems to make for better thinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s one thing I’ve been struck by, both when I saw it last month in Richard Sandford‘s &lt;a href="http://www.geekyoto.com/" target="_blank"&gt;geeKyoto&lt;/a&gt; presentation (Richard is a Learning Researcher at &lt;a href="http://www.futurelab.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Futurelab&lt;/a&gt;; he’s blogged about geeKyoto &lt;a href="http://rich.headsnet.com/notebook/2008/05/19/geekyoto/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and his presentation is available &lt;a title="Images of the Future (pdf)" href="http://rich.headsnet.com/geekyoto/geeKyoto2008_ImagesOfTheFuture.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.preoccupations.org/WindowsLiveWriter/image_6.png"&gt;&lt;img title="" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="397" alt="" src="http://www.preoccupations.org/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_4.png" width="642" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p title="let me speak seriously (2 June, 2008, Interconnected)" target="_blank" href="http://interconnected.org/home/2008/06/02/let_me_speak_seriously"&gt;and when Matt &lt;a title="let me speak seriously (2 June, 2008, Interconnected)" href="http://interconnected.org/home/2008/06/02/let_me_speak_seriously" target="_blank"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We see the world in fives: two generations back, our children, and our children's children, and ourselves. Time is a little planet with close horizons.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/rodcorp" target="_blank"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; notes on Matt’s post, Rod excerpted and commented:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;"And it's my job to carry the torch and god help me if I stumble, because I'm it now [...] and that's the burden of the middle" ... and even after kids arrive too: the burden of shepherding the generations either side on their journeys.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t know for sure whether it’s true that no day goes by without my thinking of my father, who died four years ago this October, but his memory is always close and I often think of him. It certainly feels like not a day goes by without my thinking of him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know far too little about my grandparents’ and even, when I think about it, my parents’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And into my head comes the first part of Auden’s late poem (August, 1973), ‘The Question’. It’s short, so I’ll quote it all:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;All of us believe        &lt;br&gt;we were born of a virgin         &lt;br&gt;(for who can imagine        &lt;br&gt;        &lt;br&gt;his parents copulating?),        &lt;br&gt;and cases are known        &lt;br&gt;of pregnant Virgins.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But the Question remains:       &lt;br&gt;from where did Christ get        &lt;br&gt;that extra chromosome?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his almost as brief discussion of the poem, &lt;a title="amazon.co.uk — W.H.Auden: A Commentary" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/W-H-Auden-Commentary-John-Fuller/dp/0691004196/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1213029940&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;John Fuller&lt;/a&gt; draws in Augustine writing about &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; parents, over 1600 years ago, in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_%28St._Augustine%29" target="_blank"&gt;Confessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (IX.xiii): ‘by whose bodies thou broughtest me into this life, though how I know not’.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:5163fe0d-c95e-495a-b61d-269a91ce1ed9" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/generations" rel="tag"&gt;generations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/time" rel="tag"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/memory" rel="tag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Auden" rel="tag"&gt;Auden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

    <content type="text/html" xml:lang="en-GB" xml:base="http://www.preoccupations.org/" mode="escaped">&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;To get a sense of how rapidly cellphones are penetrating the global marketplace, you need only to look at the sales figures. According to statistics from the market database Wireless Intelligence, it took about 20 years for the first billion mobile phones to sell worldwide. The second billion sold in four years, and the third billion sold in two. Eighty percent of the world’s population now lives within range of a cellular network, which is double the level in 2000. And figures from the International Telecommunications Union show that by the end of 2006, 68 percent of the world’s mobile subscriptions were in developing countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;— from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article focusing on the work of Jan Chipchase (and colleagues), &lt;a title="NYT Magazine, 13 April, 2008" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html?_r=2&amp;amp;oref=slogin&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&amp;amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank"&gt;Can the Cellphone Help End Global Poverty?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;… have you ever stopped to wonder why? Why, regardless of culture, age, gender and increasingly context you're likely to find a mobile phone in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/wheresthephone"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;hand, pocket or bag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt; of the person next to you? Put simply - &lt;strong&gt;the ability to communicate over distances in a personal convenient manner is universally understood and appreciated&lt;/strong&gt;, and it's easy enough to get the basics without going to night school or taking a PhD. It certainly helps that, &lt;strong&gt;as a functional tool that can be used discreetly or with a flourish&lt;/strong&gt;, the mobile phone makes an ideal vehicle for projecting one’s status and personal preferences - from the choice of brand, model, ring tone or wallpaper, or simply that (because you're connected) you've arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Today over 3 billion of the world's 6.6 billion people have cellular connectivity and it is expected that another billion will be connected by 2010. But &lt;strong&gt;what is often overlooked is the disproportionate impact of mobile phones on different societies&lt;/strong&gt;, which is one of the reasons why as researchers, we increasingly prefer to spend time in places like &lt;a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/mt-search.cgi?tag=Cairo&amp;amp;blog_id=1"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/mt-search.cgi?tag=Kampala&amp;amp;blog_id=1"&gt;Kampala&lt;/a&gt;: there is simply more to learn. These are places where for many, it's the first time they have the ability to communicate personally and conveniently over distances - without having to worry whether someone can overhear the topic of their conversation - communicate with whom they want, when they want. &lt;strong&gt;It makes new businesses viable and creates markets where there was none.&lt;/strong&gt; For many it's the first time they can provide a stable fixed point of reference to the outside world - a phone number, which in turn creates a new form of identity that in turn enables everything from &lt;a href="http://www.safaricom.co.ke/m-pesa/"&gt;rudimentary banking&lt;/a&gt; to commerce. And not least - &lt;strong&gt;each new feature on or accessible through the mobile phone brings new modes of use&lt;/strong&gt; - unencumbered by my, and probably your entrenched (and increasingly outdated) notions of entertainment, the 'right' way to capture and share experiences, the internet. If you work or study in the mobile space and you're expected to innovate, these are places that bring fresh thinking and new perspectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;— from Jan Chipchase's article, &lt;a title="future perfect" href="http://www.janchipchase.com/smallobjects" target="_blank"&gt;Small Objects, Travelling Further, Faster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;The human race is crossing a line. There is now one cellphone for every two humans on Earth. ... we've passed a watershed of more than 3.3 billion active cellphones on a planet of some 6.6 billion humans in about 26 years. This is the fastest global diffusion of any technology in human history -- faster even than the polio vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We knew this was going to happen a few years ago. And we know how it will end," says Eric Schmidt, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Google. "It will end with 5 billion out of the 6" with cellphones. ... "Eventually there will be more cellphone users than people who read and write. I think if you get that right, then everything else becomes obvious."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;"It's the technology most adapted to the essence of the human species -- sociability," says Arthur Molella, director of the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. "It's the ultimate tool to find each other. It's wonderful technology for being human."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;— from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/22/AR2008022202283.html?hpid=topnews" target="_blank"&gt;Our Cells, Ourselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xD;

Out of necessity, then, Ted and Marlene, who first came to St Paul's in July 2007 (see &lt;a title="Preoccupations" href="http://www.preoccupations.org/2007/07/ted-nelson.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), are soon to return to the States — but, before leaving, they revisited St Paul's. Today, Ted spoke about his work, his current book-in-progress (&lt;em&gt;Geeks Bearing Gifts&lt;/em&gt;) and Xanadu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Farhan's &lt;a title="psyche: Transclusion" href="http://disinformatics.com/blog/2008/02/05/transclusion/" target="_blank"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; Ted's talk so well that there's little left for me to add. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some lovely glimpses into Ted's childhood — a boy who loved reading and words and knew, by ten, who had coined &lt;em&gt;tintinnabulate&lt;/em&gt; … &lt;em&gt;chortle&lt;/em&gt; … &lt;em&gt;serendipity&lt;/em&gt;; growing up in Greenwich Village without realising it, then reading about it and longing to see this Bohemian paradise; experiencing Mrs Roosevelt as a near neighbour. He was (as expected) both amusing and savage about the blackhole which is the clipboard. His father had taught him that writing is mostly re-writing, and re-writing is mostly rearrangement — so why devise writing tools that are so bad they hide the very material you're cutting? (CTRL+C, CTRL+V: cram and vomit.) By the time he went to college, he'd written a lot by linking cut and pasted pieces of writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graduate school in 1960 and a computing course saw him suddenly quite sure that personal computers would come and that his job was to design the documents of the future: make it possible to see the parts and compare the versions, to visualise the origins of quotations, to expose deep rearrangements. &lt;em&gt;Hypertext&lt;/em&gt; was first used by Ted in 1963, but it was 1986 before it was used outside his immediate circle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was great to have Ted and Marlene here again. I was particularly pleased that a number of our 13/14 year-old students came along: Ted has been a name to them in their ICT course — and here he was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:74a2a2bc-17be-4d65-8d88-44d5c2c64abf" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Ted%20Nelson" rel="tag"&gt;Ted Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Xanadu" rel="tag"&gt;Xanadu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ZigZag" rel="tag"&gt;ZigZag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I needed to prepare something for use at school that would act as a summary to date of this debate. I took as my markers some of the high profile coverage Wi-Fi has received over the last year. It might be worth publishing this brief overview here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; There's no basis for proceeding that's worthy of our consideration other than one based on the scientific evidence. There's masses of conjecture which generates fear, uncertainty and doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; Let's start with mobile phones and phone masts - forms of wireless communication the radiation from which is (at source) far more powerful than that emitted by the kinds of wireless access points we'd be installing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;a)&amp;nbsp; December, 2006: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="reported in arstechnica" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061206-8366.html" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a study of 420,095 cell phone users (Danes). They began subscribing to cellular phone services between 1982 and 1995, and the study examines their cancer rates through to 2002. The study 'finds no increased risk of tumors or leukemia in subscribers'; 'Even among the 56,000 people who have used the phones for more than a decade, researchers found no increased risk of cancer'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;b)&amp;nbsp; July, 2007: &lt;a title="research into symptoms claimed to be linked to phone masts" href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2007/nr20070725.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the Essex University phone mast study&lt;/a&gt; — 'when tests were carried out under double-blind conditions, where neither experimenter nor participant knew whether the signal was on or off, the number of symptoms reported was not related to whether the mast was on or off. Two of the 44 sensitive individuals correctly judged whether the mast was on or off in all six tests, compared with five out of 114 control participants. This proportion is what is expected by chance and was not increased in the sensitive group'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;3)&amp;nbsp; Now we come to the Panorama programme, 'Wi-Fi: A Warning Signal', that ran last May and which the BBC's editorial complaints unit &lt;a title="Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/30/bbc.television2" target="_blank"&gt;subsequently (November) conceded&lt;/a&gt; had not had 'adequate balance' and so had given 'a misleading impression of the state of scientific opinion on the issue'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;a)&amp;nbsp; There's a a succinct and clear explanation of a fundamental flaw in the Panorama programme &lt;a title="James Randerson: Why fear Wi-Fi?" href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/james_randerson/2007/05/why_fear_wifi.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. From the same source: 'Wi-Fi uses radio frequency (RF) waves that are "non-ionising" - that means they are not powerful enough to knock electrons off molecules in cells. One way they could harm cells is by heating them up. But this requires much higher power than is delivered by Wi-Fi networks or mobile phones (which use similar frequencies).&amp;nbsp; As every cautious scientist will tell you, you can never prove that something is absolutely safe and no one would want to gamble with the health of children. But there is good reason for thinking that Wi-Fi is, if anything, safer than the radiation from a mobile phone. The UK's Health Protection Agency says a person sitting within a Wi-Fi hotspot for a year receives the same dose of radio waves as a person using a mobile phone for 20 minutes'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;b)&amp;nbsp; Ben Goldacre, who, of course, writes the excellent &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; 'Bad Science' column, took the Panorama programme to pieces and has also analysed the whole melange of ideas swirling round the "electrosensitivity" theme: &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/?p=425" target="_blank"&gt;Electrosensitives: the new cash cow of the woo industry&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/?p=418" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi Wants To Kill Your Children… But Alasdair Philips of Powerwatch sells the cure!&lt;/a&gt; ('Of course you should be vigilant about health risks. I don't question that there may be some issues worth sober investigation around Wi-Fi safety. But this documentary was the lowest, most misleading scaremongering I have seen in a very long time.')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;4)&amp;nbsp; I felt it was probably worth my including the two &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; articles from last year, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/danger-on-the-airwaves-is-the-wifi-revolution-a-health-time-bomb-445732.html" target="_blank"&gt;Danger on the airwaves: Is the Wi-Fi revolution a health time bomb?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/wifi-children-at-risk-from-electronic-smog-445725.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi: Children at risk from 'electronic smog'&lt;/a&gt; (both from April). These will have lodged themselves in the minds of some — and they're truly bad. Ian Betteridge took both apart &lt;a title="for now, via the Wayback Machine" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070701194434/www.ianbetteridge.co.uk/technovia/?p=1069" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, concluding, 'what really matters is that the quality of the Indie's reporting on this is abysmal. Printing scare stories isn't just bad journalism - it's bad behaviour that actually damages our culture, promoting bad, hokey ideas as fact and encouraging anti-scientific and anti-rational propaganda. I'd love to ask the editor of the Indie which they prefer - a world where science and reason are encouraged, or a world of cranks, quacks and charlatans'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A paragraph or two summing up what we can say we know and how best, then, we should proceed?&amp;nbsp; I can't really do better than these, from &lt;a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/james_randerson/2007/05/why_fear_wifi.html" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; already cited in 3a above:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The World Health Organisation's &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; on this is very clear. "Considering the very low exposure levels and research results collected to date, there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects."&amp;nbsp; And an HPA &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/understand/radiation_topics/emf/wifi.htm" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; issued last week is equally adamant that Wi-Fi almost certainly does not pose a problem. "On the basis of current scientific information Wi-Fi equipment satisfies international guidelines. There is no consistent evidence of health effects from RF exposures below guideline levels and therefore no reason why schools and others should not use Wi-Fi equipment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;And apart from bogus TV experiments, what do we know about the strength of Wi-Fi radiation in homes, schools and businesses? Kenneth Foster, a Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, took 356 &lt;a href="http://hps.org/hpspublications/articles/wirelessnetworks.html" target="_blank"&gt;measurements&lt;/a&gt; at 55 different sites in four different countries to find out. Even though he took his readings close to wireless routers, in all cases he &lt;a href="http://www.health-physics.com/pt/re/healthphys/abstract.00004032-200703000-00010.htm;jsessionid=GRXPPTnBJwwDfyLqB49YTgwq2wyrxDh3JBbsWG11hQgf5bcJxxTF!741375937!-949856145!8091!-1" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the radiation level from Wi-Fi was far lower than international safety standards and often much lower than other radiation sources nearby.&amp;nbsp; Wi-Fi is a new addition to modern life and no scientist can say with her hand on her heart that it is perfectly safe - particularly in the long term. But there is no theoretical reason to expect problems and no good evidence for any harm. Of course we need more research to understand its effects more thoroughly and also sensible precautions. But misleading and irresponsible scare stories serve only to cloud the issue.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:0eaa9bcf-4c84-41a3-bd67-26366d3f5899" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/WiFi" rel="tag"&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/health" rel="tag"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/FUD" rel="tag"&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/bad%20science" rel="tag"&gt;bad science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/media" rel="tag"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcoming Jack Schulze to St Paul's a week ago was the realisation of a long-held wish: it is, of course, an understatement to say that &lt;a title="Schulze &amp;amp; Webb Ltd" href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jack and Matt&lt;/a&gt; continually surprise and delight, prompting and pushing us on to think about, &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; things in new ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a title="Russell Davies" href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/interesting2007/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Interesting2007&lt;/a&gt; (start at the bottom of that page, with &lt;a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2007/03/an_idea.html" target="_blank"&gt;a possible date for your diary&lt;/a&gt;), Jack gave a fantastic (and warmly received) talk on comics. (I blogged about Interesting &lt;a title="Preoccupations — Interesting2007: pattern recognition" href="http://www.preoccupations.org/2007/06/interesting2007.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) When we cooked up the idea of Jack coming in to talk to some of our students, I really wanted comics in the frame. Anyone who knows Jack knows how comics — their design, their &lt;em&gt;playfulness&lt;/em&gt; — inform his work as designer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jack's and Matt's design work is a challenge in a number of ways. For UK schools (perhaps for a long time — but certainly now) there's far too little in the curriculum that prepares you for how they think and work. I can imagine how even the diverse influences that inform their work might seem at first bewildering, even unassimilable. Since Jack spoke here, what's struck me is how all who heard him seem to have got hold of something (and haven't readily let go) and, in some cases, seem to have understood him whole and from the start — great for any speaker/teacher to feel this quick rush of comprehension at an intuitive (I'm-on-this-wavelength) level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of our students may find it helpful if I pull together some links here for the different parts of Jack's talk. In order of appearance, then:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/2005/meat/" target="_blank"&gt;Lab-Grown Meat&lt;/a&gt;, 2005: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="375" alt="a kangaroo steak with some pickled onions" src="http://schulzeandwebb.com/2005/meat/images/meat.008.jpg" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;While at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.interaction.rca.ac.uk/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;RCA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, Jack took part in a brief run by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dunneandraby.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Tony Dunne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt; on the industrial future of food and lab-grown meat (a staple of the newspaper columns in 2005). This presentation comes from a two week exploration that also involved the making of replica origami food, as shown in the slides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;From Dunne’s original brief: &lt;em&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists are developing methods of growing meat in labs using animal cells. This area of research, called In Vitro-Cultured Meat Production raises all sorts of complex issues about the meaning of food, our relationship to animals (and nature), human values and behaviours, and even taboos. [...] The purpose of the project is to explore how design can be used as a medium to draw attention to the social, cultural and ethical implications of ‘cultured meat’.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.schulzeandwebb.com/2005/personalisation/metalphone.html" target="_blank"&gt;Metal phone (Nokia Personalisation)&lt;/a&gt;, 2005. This link takes you to all the postings about the project; you can start with &lt;a href="http://www.schulzeandwebb.com/2005/personalisation/overview.html" target="_blank"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;We’re working with practitioners of a number of different crafts to explore how their materials affect the mobile phone. We’re experimenting with the short-run manufacturing techniques available in small workshops and on desktops to look at, for example, the impact of Rapid Form Prototyping on phone housing.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/74/172676242_6c741b9e17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;p&gt; 3) &lt;a title="BBC Olinda digital radio: Social hardware" href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/08/20/bbc-olinda-digital-radio-social-hardware/" target="_blank"&gt;Olinda&lt;/a&gt;, 2007: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;For the past month we’ve been working on the feasibility of Olinda, a DAB digital radio prototype for the BBC (for non-UK readers: DAB is the local digital radio standard, getting traction globally). That stage is almost over now - oh and yes, it’s feasible - so now’s a good time to talk.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Olinda puts three ideas into practice:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Radios can look better than the regular ‘kitchen radio’ devices. Radios can have novel interfaces that make the whole life-cycle of listening easier. At short runs, wood is more economic as plastic, so we’re using a strong bamboo ply. And forget preset buttons: &lt;strong&gt;Olinda monitors your listening habits so switching between two stations is the simplest possible action, with no configuration step.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;This can be radio for the Facebook generation. Built-in wifi connects to the internet and uses a social ‘now listening’ site the BBC already have built. Now a small number of your friends are represented on the device: &lt;strong&gt;A light comes on, your friend is listening; press a button and you tune in to listen to the same programme.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;If an API works to make websites adaptive, participative with the developer community, and have more appropriate interfaces, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2006/11/27/widgets-widgets-everywhere/" target="_blank"&gt;hardware API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt; should work just as well. Modular hardware is achievable, so &lt;strong&gt;the friends functionality will be its own component operating through a documented, open, hardware API running over serial.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;What Olinda isn’t is a far-future concept piece or a smoke-and-mirrors prototype. There’s no hidden Mac Mini–it’s a &lt;strong&gt;standalone, fully operational, social, digital radio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hardware API link above is well worth following. I'd also recommend Jack's three posts: &lt;a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/09/21/drawing-olinda/" target="_blank"&gt;Drawing Olinda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/12/03/olinda-interface-drawings/" target="_blank"&gt;Olinda interface drawings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/12/18/olinda-connections/" target="_blank"&gt;Olinda connections&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Comics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jack blogged his Interesting talk &lt;a title="Pulse Laser: Interesting2007" href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/07/10/interesting-2007/ " target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; — and lists the comics and authors he admires most. The slides of his talk are &lt;a title="Comics and Pictures that Know They're Being Looked At" href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/2007/comics/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The wonderful Will Burtin image (drawn from a rifle manual) can be found in &lt;a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2006/11/29/burtin-vs-elliswilliams/" target="_blank"&gt;Burtin vs. Ellis/Williams&lt;/a&gt;, where Jack discusses it in relation to one of my all-time favourite images — page 5 of &lt;em&gt;Desolation Jones #1&lt;/em&gt; by Warren Ellis and J H Williams III. Warren Ellis has written about this image on his &lt;a title="DESOLATION JONES #1: Author’s Commentary" href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=974" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, quoting from the original script:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pic 1: &lt;/strong&gt;Surreal moment: Jones looks out the passenger-side
window and there’s a thick RED LINE taking the place of the road,
running alongside them – a massively magnified version of the kind of
line that describes roads on maps.&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pic 3: &lt;/strong&gt;AERIAL
SHOT: The car is small in this shot, and it’s driving down a red line
that describes a road, and now the rest of the map, of greater LA, is
visible all around it…&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos23.flickr.com/24941144_c64b17763d_b.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img width="314" height="484" border="0" align="middle" alt="Warren Ellis" src="http://www.preoccupations.org/WindowsLiveWriter/Warren%20Ellis.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; margin: 0px 25px 0px 0px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt; Jack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Look at the way the red line connects the sequence. The line morphs between road markings, Indiana Jones style aerial map views and back to the light trails from the vehicle. Williams guides your eye through the page, setting the page’s pace and rhythm. Optically it is very clever, it deals with how your eye scans at speed and also stitches the cue into the content of the panels. …&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Burtin and Williams both use letters and images, in a sequence, on the page, and expect them to be read in two different ways: First in overview and then in detail. They deal with arrangement, pace and rhythm with the same sensitivity and same language.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Comics are in everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, Jack spoke about the work of &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shintaro_Kago" target="_blank"&gt;Shintaro Kago&lt;/a&gt; … &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Mr. Kago is what you’d call an &lt;em&gt;ero-guro&lt;/em&gt; artist — that is, he specializes in bizarre and oftentimes disturbing manga with a hefty amount of blood, nudity, gore and violence. Don’t let this discourage you: I think what I find most interesting is the way he challenges paneling conventions. The idea of paneling in comics is to find the most ideal way to lead the eye of the reader in order to communicate a story. Mr. Kago pushes this to the limit. In his work “Abstraction”, Mr. Kago even goes a step further by integrating his experimentation with panels into the story in itself by making it a part of the plot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title="Shintaro Kago: Panelling Experimentation and Bizarre Manga" href="http://read-or-die.org/blog/2007/10/09/shintaro-kago-panelling-experimentation-and-bizarre-manga/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Read Or Die Weblog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="308" height="484" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.preoccupations.org/WindowsLiveWriter/image20.png" style="border-width: 0px; margin: 0px 100px 0px 0px;" /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.preoccupations.org/WindowsLiveWriter/image_5.png"&gt;&lt;img width="308" height="484" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.preoccupations.org/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_3.png" style="border-width: 0px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;center&gt;*****&amp;nbsp; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thanks to Jack for a wonderful talk. Here are a couple of bonus leads for all who came to hear him:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=5405" target="_blank"&gt;Warren Ellis » A Useful Quote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;“Science fiction is a way of thinking about things.” – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frederikpohl.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Frederik Pohl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Which may seem like a small notion. But it’s possibly the best working definition of sf I’ve yet come across, insofar as it does the crucial business of inviting the body in front of you to consider sf as &lt;em&gt;a tool with which to understand the contemporary world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=614" target="_blank"&gt;The Pinocchio Theory » Sex + Love With Robots&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;More precisely, SF (and nonfiction futuristic speculation as well) is a tool with which to understand those aspects of the contemporary world that are unfinished, still in process, and therefore (as it were) redolent of futurity. SF and futurism are vital and necessary, because they make us stop and look at the changes going on all around us, breaking with the “rear-view-mirrorism” (as Marshall McLuhan called it) that otherwise characterizes the way we tend to look at the world. That’s why I find it indispensable to read people like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/sterling/" target="_blank"&gt;Bruce Sterling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://openthefuture.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jamais Cascio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441014984/dhalgrenstevensh" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Stross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.warrenellis.com" target="_blank"&gt;Warren Ellis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;, and so on. The line between science fiction and futurist speculation is an extremely thin one (and some of the people on my list, most notably Sterling, explicitly do both). Extrapolating the future is necessarily a fiction-making activity; but we can’t understand the present, or be ready for the future, unless we go beyond empirical fact and turn to fiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:6bf2306f-5705-42cb-96be-ec777b59ff3a" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline; float: none;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Jack%20Schulze" rel="tag"&gt;Jack Schulze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Schulze%20&amp;amp;%20Webb" rel="tag"&gt;Schulze &amp;amp; Webb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/social%20hardware" rel="tag"&gt;social hardware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/hardware%20APIs" rel="tag"&gt;hardware APIs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Interesting2007" rel="tag"&gt;Interesting2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Olinda" rel="tag"&gt;Olinda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/comics" rel="tag"&gt;comics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laptop needed some repair work. Limping by on a school machine during the day was made more than bearable by having the use of an iPod touch the rest of the time and access to an N810. None of these are my own. Of the three, the iPod touch is a revelation — so easy to use, the Gmail interface is (as of now) outstanding and surfing the web on it is often a joy. I don't yet know the N810 well enough to comment about it, but one thing that lets the iPod touch down is the laboriousness of entering text. I look forward to putting the N810's keyboard through its paces, but somehow I doubt it will prove as comfortable to use as the E70's thumb keyboard. The E70 is simply the best device I've ever owned for texting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As ever when my laptop's down, I learn things. One thing I learned this time: wireless, mobile computing is getting pretty enjoyable all of a sudden. Like everyone else, I now want to try the Asus EEE. These are all devices we need to trial in school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp; &lt;a title="Amazon &amp;mdash; Across the Border to Spook Country: An Interview with William Gibson" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000112701" target="_blank"&gt;William Gibson&lt;/a&gt; (my bold):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;One of the things I discovered while I was writing &lt;i&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/i&gt; is that I now think that &lt;strong&gt;any contemporary novel today has a kind of Google novel aura around it&lt;/strong&gt;, where somebody's going to google everything in the text. So people--and this happened to me with &lt;i&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/i&gt;--would find my footprints so to speak: well, he got this from here, and this information is on this site.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, &lt;a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&lt;/a&gt; — 1998, pdf: "Google is designed to provide higher quality search so as the Web continues to grow rapidly, information can be found easily. In order to accomplish this Google makes heavy use of hypertextual information consisting of link structure and link [anchor] text. Google also uses proximity and font information. … The analysis of link structure via PageRank allows Google to evaluate the quality of web pages. The use of link text as a description of what the link points to helps the search engine return relevant [and to some degree high quality] results. Finally, the use of proximity information helps increase relevance a great deal for many queries.")&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;II&amp;nbsp; &lt;a title="With apologies to Walter Benjamin &amp;laquo; Adam Greenfield&amp;rsquo;s Speedbird" href="http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2008/01/19/with-apologies-to-walter-benjamin/" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Greenfield&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;… the book is an obsolete mediation between two different hypertext systems. For everything essential is found on the del.icio.us page of the researcher who writes it, and the reader who studies it assimilates it into his or her own blog.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:586b1b06-6a3d-470a-8338-083ec3f6985e" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/mobile%20computing" rel="tag"&gt;mobile computing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/writing" rel="tag"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/knowledge" rel="tag"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Google" rel="tag"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/del.icio.us" rel="tag"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The material is in the public domain, on JotSpot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, here's the &lt;a title="Fourth Form ICT Syllabus (07-08)" href="http://preoccupations.jot.com/WikiHome/Fourth%20Form%20ICT%20Syllabus%20%2807-08%29" target="_blank"&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;. (It's open to revision this year, as we teach it, and, of course, before we teach it again next year.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Autumn Term&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICT at school, home ... mobile&lt;br /&gt;Internet &amp;amp; web: key figures and events&lt;br /&gt;Reading the social web: browsers, RSS and search&lt;br /&gt;Communicating &amp;amp; collaborating, on- and off-line I: Office(s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Spring Term&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicating &amp;amp; collaborating, on- and off-line II: webmail, IM, chat, VoIP; blogs &amp;amp; wikis; video- and photo-sharing; social bookmarking and tagging; maps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Summer Term&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Responsibility and Identity: &lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt; (critical reading, responsible writing); social software (privacy, safety, digital identity)&lt;br /&gt;The Law: copyright (links, permissions, problems); music (file-sharing, DRM); defamation and abuse (rights and responsibilities)&lt;br /&gt;Games&lt;br /&gt;Virtual Worlds&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's a &lt;a title="Background for teachers" href="http://preoccupations.jot.com/WikiHome/4th%20Form%20ICT%3A%202007%E2%80%938" target="_blank"&gt;wealth&lt;/a&gt; of linked-to background material that served earlier this year as stuff for the department to immerse itself in as it readied itself.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://preoccupations.jot.com/WikiHome/4th%20Form%20ICT%3A%20lesson%2012"&gt;12 Office: I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We've had fun delivering these within the constraints of time (&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; 40-minute lesson a week!) and the engagement of the pupils has been inspiring.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing what we've been doing, my concern has been to leave behind what John Naughton called (in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Welcome to IT class, children; log on and be bored stiff" href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1984347,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) the Old Person's ICT Curriculum. I also found inspiration along the way in Dave Snowden's blog post, &lt;a title="Cognitive Edge" href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2007/10/huginn_and_muginn.php" target="_blank"&gt;Huginn and Muginn&lt;/a&gt;. Not everything there meshes with what we're doing (we're not delivering touch-typing and, yes, we should be) and we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; teaching something of a body of knowledge (eg, about web history — Eliot: 'A people without history Is not redeemed from time' — but that's not what he was referring to: see 'don't teach ICT as if it was a &amp;quot;body of knowledge&amp;quot;'). Such things apart, I'm entirely at one with the spirit of remarks like these:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;… &lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;make computers and broadband a universal right, like water … most computing skills and all social computing capability is learnt by &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; and by regular practice rather than classroom lessons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;… &lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;what really matters is that children experience and contribute to the evolution of technology, and to see that evolution as a symbiotic relationship with human kind. That requires us … [to be] thoughtful and mindful. We don't need to sacrifice an eye to gain wisdom … but we do need to sacrifice an over explicit non-experiential approach to ICT teaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also like his fifth point:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Let things emerge, don't plan … It's not so much about repeating a success as repeating the conditions which led to that success. In any complex system you can never replicate outcome, but you can replicate starting conditions. … you want multiple diverse initiatives to emerge, and you want to measure their impact on the social and educational fabric … not a series of pre-determined targeted outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's been a surprising amount of room for things to emerge: pupils experiment in their own time, bring a lot to the table, anyway, and are excited by discovering more about the powers given them by contemporary computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd add to all this a word about the re-appraisal of Prensky's influential &lt;em&gt;digital natives&lt;/em&gt; meme — a re-appraisal that has been going on for some time now. Here's &lt;a title="Reconsidering Digital Immigrants..." href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/2007/12/reconsidering_digital_immigran.html" target="_blank"&gt;Henry Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; (writing earlier this month):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em;"&gt;Talk of &amp;quot;digital natives&amp;quot; helps us to recognize and respect the new kinds of learning and cultural expression which have emerged from a generation that has come of age alongside the personal and networked computer. Yet, talk of &amp;quot;digital natives&amp;quot; may also mask the different degrees [of] access to and comfort with emerging technologies experienced by different youth. Talk of digital natives may make it harder for us to pay attention to the digital divide in terms of who has access to different technical platforms and the participation gap in terms of who has access to certain skills and competencies or for that matter, certain cultural experiences and social identities. Talking about youth as digital natives implies that there is a world which these young people all share and a body of knowledge they have all mastered, rather than seeing the online world as unfamiliar and uncertain for all of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teaching this course this year, we have had it confirmed that being born in 1994 doesn't mean that online life, for all that it may be familiar, is well &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt;: where it's come from, what it can do and what your options are — these are all things that unite adults and teens as we seek to develop and mature in this new and changing world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ad3260ed-072a-4566-8e85-015ae2344dee" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline; float: none;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ICT" rel="tag"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/St%20Paul's" rel="tag"&gt;St Paul's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/youth" rel="tag"&gt;youth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/teens" rel="tag"&gt;teens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/teaching" rel="tag"&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/digital%20natives" rel="tag"&gt;digital natives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/digital%20divide" rel="tag"&gt;digital divide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vint Cerf in last Monday's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="We built the road, now let's see where the journey takes us" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/dec/03/mondaymediasection.googlethemedia" target="_blank"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is not often that a technological innovation changes fundamentally the way people communicate. In the 15th century the printing press made it possible to distribute the written word. In the 19th century, the telegraph enabled rapid point-to-point communication over long distances. Then there was the telephone. And we're still coming to terms with the social effects of radio and television. &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It takes decades if not generations to fully understand the impact of such inventions. We are barely two decades into the commercial availability of the internet, but it has already changed the world. It has fostered self-expression and freed information from the constraints of physical location, opening up the world's information to people everywhere.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Burningbird: Do something useful: Don't read this" href="http://burningbird.net/technology/its-the-internets-fault/" target="_blank"&gt;Shelley Powers&lt;/a&gt;, responding two days ago to Doris Lessing's &lt;a title="Guardian: Nobel Prize acceptance speech" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/nobelprize/story/0,,2224068,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;bleak assessment&lt;/a&gt; of the internet's impact on culture, education and reading:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The internet is no more culpable for people 'wasting' time away than the television was, and the radio before that, and the electric light before that–on back through history marked by one invention or another. Technology does not change culture, as much as technology and culture impact, equally, on each other. … &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;… Amazon has grown fat on the profits of selling that which we supposedly disdain: books. Entire web sites spend most or all of their space providing reviews of, what else, books. The Gutenberg Project actually makes books available online for free. Ms. Lessing mistakes our assumptions of easy access of books for indifference to books. A very romantic thought, but not a very logical one. …&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As for the banalities of this space, among the items I've read this week were [detailed summary of online reading, viewing and web-led book discoveries follows] … I would be curious to know at what point in all of this reading is the moment where I stepped over the line from spending time in banal pursuits, to spending time usefully?
