Bobbi Emel summarizes the event for both math geeks  and the numerically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Keith Devlin is &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/%7Ekdevlin/MathGuy.html"&gt;"The Math Guy" on NPR&lt;/a&gt; and, apparently, a lot of people like math as was evidenced by our large crowd. &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;fromauthor=yes&amp;amp;author=7024369"&gt;Dr. Devlin has written 28 books&lt;/a&gt;, but this was his first attempt at weaving history in with math. His book recounts a letter written in 1654 from Blaise Pascal to Pierre de Fermat that solves the long-standing "problem of the points." Devlin's subtitle refers to this missive as "the letter that made the world modern." Why? Well, the solution to the problem of the points resulted in the theory of probability which quickly led to more sophisticated gambling, then ideas about life expectancy, insurance, annuities, and all manner of actuarial processes. Probability theory led people to think rationally about the future and how it might develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Dr. Devlin was a lively speaker and brought along a short powerpoint presentation which was very helpful during the illustration of the solution of the problem of the points. Basically, the problem of the points was this: say two players were playing a game of flipping a coin and the winner was the person who could win 3 out of 5 games. A pot of money was the prize. What if, however, the players had to quit the game with one of them ahead 2-1? How should they then split the pot? It seems that the person (A) who has won 2 games should take 2/3 of the pot and the other person (B) take 1/3, right? Wrong. Fermat and Pascal correctly theorized that, if played out, there were only 4 possibilities that would occur in the two remaining games: Person A wins the next two tosses (A wins the pot,) Person A wins the next toss and Person B wins the last toss (A still wins the pot,) Person A loses the next toss, but wins the last toss (A still wins the pot,) or Person B wins the next two tosses (B wins the pot.) Thus, out of the four possibilities, A wins 3 times and B wins 1 time. Therefore, with the game suspended at 2-1, Person A should take 3/4 of the pot and Person B should take 1/4 of the pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;This explanation was much better with animation and Danny Glover's voice explaining it on Dr. Devlin's powerpoint slides. Anyway, imagine that this solution, which seems simple to us now, was of such magnititude that it shaped our present day world. No wonder the author was so excited about it!&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/10/keith-devlin-and-unfinished-game.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQjN7_PXgoI/AAAAAAAAAMM/Q_42gJ8RfIE/s72-c/keith_devlin.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>40</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-3754392649475272938</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2008 03:27:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-11-02T20:36:11.558-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Sarah Vowell - The Wordy Shipmates</category><title>Sarah Vowell:  "The Wordy Shipmates"</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQ5-tnIHEfI/AAAAAAAAAMk/GNrVbCMAiuU/s1600-h/sarah_vowell.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 124px; height: 314px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQ5-tnIHEfI/AAAAAAAAAMk/GNrVbCMAiuU/s320/sarah_vowell.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264284336504902130" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Event summary by: Terry Meagher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Sarah, an author who knows how to title her books (&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780743260046"&gt;Assassination Vacation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Take+the+Cannoli&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Take the Cannoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=The+Partly+Cloudy+Patriot&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), was a terrific speaker/reader, her deadpan timing and delivery impeccable, right up there with the best stand-up comedians.  &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781594489990"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;The Wordy Shipmates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Sarah’s investigation into our nation’s heritage, specifically, an exploration of the Puritans, the people we consider our philosophical, spiritual, and moral ancestors.  Her rigorous research (she read a ton of sermons) challenges our perceptions and reveals these colonists as hardly ignorant, but rather highly literate, principled, and surprisingly feisty.  It’s a great read, bringing to life some of those fascinating characters – John Winthrop, John Cotton, Anne Hutchinson – whom we all once studied, but perhaps have long since forgotten.  She is particularly adept at drawing parallels with modern day history and noting how the concept of American exceptionalism has its roots in the Calvinist tradition, followers of which felt they were a “chosen people”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;She spoke humorously of some historical character (can’t recall his name) involved in expeditions and (like herself) simply not a hearty person; he loathed every physical aspect of his expeditions, but how he savored keeping a diary - apparently, to hilarious effect.  So excited was he when some outsiders came to his encampment to deliver salt (the food had been ‘til then horribly bland) that he stayed behind while his fellow explorers spent the day out and about, discovering a little body of water later known as Lake Tahoe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;When asked what she liked about our own “Sunshine” state, Sarah didn’t mention our weather (“I like snow”), but said she’s fond of our trees, particularly the Redwood, certain of our writers (Chandler), has an affinity for the domestic architecture of 1900-1930’s L.A.  (Julia Morgan, certain buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright, the craftsman style of the Green Brothers) and likes the &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;McSweeney’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; people.  What she didn’t like was the fact she has to pay CA state taxes, yet is forbidden to vote!  When asked what question she’d herself would most liked to be asked, she sighed, “Do you want to take a nap?!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;She mentioned she just finished reading Rodney Rothman’s memoir “&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780743270588"&gt;Early Bird&lt;/a&gt;” about a 28 year old laid off Hollywood writer who retires early, taking up residence in a retirement community.  She found it very funny, at times poignant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/10/sarah-vowell-wordy-shipmates.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQ5-tnIHEfI/AAAAAAAAAMk/GNrVbCMAiuU/s72-c/sarah_vowell.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>12</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-8450512943755705601</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2008 21:06:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-10-29T14:16:21.713-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Diana Johnson - Lulu in Marrakech</category><title>Diane Johnson and "LuLu in Marrakech, a Novel</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQjQ969729I/AAAAAAAAAMU/cz2y6UNmcwQ/s1600-h/diane_johnson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 108px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQjQ969729I/AAAAAAAAAMU/cz2y6UNmcwQ/s320/diane_johnson.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5262685926802054098" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;A modest group of 30 people turned out on a balmy, fall evening to hear Diane Johnson read from her latest novel &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780525950370"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;LuLu in Marrakech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The novel is the story of 30-something LuLu Sawyer, a C.I.A. operator dispatched to Marrakech,  Morocco, to help trace the flow of money from well-heeled donors to radical Islamic groups.  She is hoping as well to rekindle her romance with the worldly Brit, Ian Drumm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Diane is an elderly, gracious woman who had flown in from NYC that afternoon; I surmised she must have been a tad tuckered out from her travels, but she proved quite the trooper, kindly personalizing books prior to her reading.  She is the author of the highly praised, loosely based trilogy of novels - &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780452277335"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Le Divorce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780452282261"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Le Mariage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780452285637"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;L’ Affaire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -about naïve Americans living abroad in Paris.  (Indeed, Diane appeared quite pumped about departing in 5 days for her own annual, six month stay in France.)  She is also a two-time Pulitzer Prize and three-time National Book Award nominee (“Give the poor woman an award, already!” I crowed during my intro – Diane did giggle at this.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;The author read several short excerpts, focusing on different characters and their various outlooks/attitudes toward the Moroccan culture and its people.  In a nice touch, Diane inflected the dialogue with the appropriate accent (English, French) of the character speaking.  Her husband, who was present and apparently serves as her “timekeeper”, gave her an affectionate wave after she had read for some 15 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;During Q&amp;amp;A people were quite interested in Morocco.  Diane mentioned that Marrakech has become very much the tourist destination - beautiful hotels, organized tour guides and such. Those wanting a more authentic experience should visit the city of Fez, a place of deep, historical significance.  In answer to one person’s question, the majority of people speak French, not English (which makes sense for a country once a French colony).  Diane mentioned that the native population remains rather ambivalent toward the French.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Interestingly, Diane couldn’t pinpoint exactly the source of her decision to make the protagonist an American operative – her admiration of Graham Greene notwithstanding.  She did mention that since staying in France she has noticed a strange pattern:  she’s repeatedly crossing paths with various members of the C.I.A.  (Which actually came in handy:  Sally Colby - wife of some C.I.A bigwig - vetted many of the book’s details.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Diane said she is currently at work on a collection of short stories titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Men on Top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, tales involving doctors, sheiks, generals, movie directors, etc.)  The author chose as her gift book &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780316143479"&gt;David Sedaris’ &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;When You Are Engulfed in Flames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(“He’s a neighbor of mine in Paris”).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;contributed by Terry Meagher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/10/diane-johnson-and-lulu-in-marrakech.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQjQ969729I/AAAAAAAAAMU/cz2y6UNmcwQ/s72-c/diane_johnson.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-3351086401535508879</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2008 21:18:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-10-29T14:32:24.850-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Cancer is a Bitch</category><title>Cancer is a Bitch - Gail Konop Baker</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQjVXll7cPI/AAAAAAAAAMc/T9XqqcAcPOM/s1600-h/gail_konop_baker.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 124px; height: 272px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SQjVXll7cPI/AAAAAAAAAMc/T9XqqcAcPOM/s320/gail_konop_baker.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5262690765787328754" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="file:///Users/kellybuh/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt="" /&gt;October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.&lt;br /&gt;So we kicked it off with an evening with Gail Konop Baker talking about her book &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=cancer+is+a+bitch&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Cancer is a Bitch, or I'd Rather be Having a Midlife Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gail read a couple chapters from her book with energy and great humor.

Hunnicutt&lt;/a&gt;, opposite Alda’s Hawkeye Pierce, in &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098/"&gt;M*A*S*H&lt;/a&gt;, during which period he earned nominations for Director’s Guild and Emmy awards for the episodes he wrote and directed.  In his first post-M*A*S*H TV role, a CBS-TV movie called “Memorial Day,” he starred opposite &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001193/"&gt;Shelley Fabares&lt;/a&gt; – of “Coach” and “Superman” among other roles.  They married in 1984.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana;font-size:100%;color:navy;"   &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Verdana;font-size:100%;color:navy;"   &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Mike expressed a lot of gratitude for the opportunities he’s had in his life, including a lot of world travel.  Raised in a working-class Irish family which was, to say the least, more fear-provoking and violent than nurturing, he set off young on his two life journeys: the dream of being in show business and the journey to find out who he was as a human being.  To this day, he considers M*A*S*H one of the highlights of his life and, in response to a question, said that he had lots more fun being part of the show than we did watching it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;One of the experiences that occurred during his second journey took place while he was stationed in Tokyo as a Marine.  He was shocked to learn, for instance, that other marines were not at all accepting or forgiving of the fact that Mike had a black Marine buddy.  He slowly but surely came to define “human rights” as a large umbrella that covered a lot of issues, including gay rights and prisoners’ rights.  He feels that every person has value but little by little many of us have come to feel invisible and that we don’t matter.  Mike’s strongly behind the view that we all have to be as good as our principles have taught us, and that if our government is failing us, then it’s our responsibility to do something about it. He currently chairs a group called &lt;a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/"&gt;Death Penalty Focus&lt;/a&gt;, and, thanks to our good friend and author &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Michealene+Risley&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Michealene Risley&lt;/a&gt; – who did a glowing intro for Mike – we also had representatives from the &lt;a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-mission-and-the-movement/the-ginetta-sagan-fund/page.do?id=1104604"&gt;Ginetta Sagan Fund of Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; and IDEX (&lt;a href="http://www.idex.org/"&gt;International Development Exchange&lt;/a&gt;) in the audience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/09/mike-farrell-at-keplers.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-8107017736478365572</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2008 18:21:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-08-05T11:35:19.498-07:00</atom:updated><title>Ally Carter video &amp; New Teen Blog!</title><description>Ally Carter's first book, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781423100041"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I’d Tell You That I Love You But, Then I’d Have To Kill You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is a Kepler's favorite.

Jones is the author of &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780061253201"&gt;What Would Martin Say?&lt;/a&gt; - the fascinating and somewhat controversial book about his friend, Martin Luther King, Jr.  Jones spoke at Kepler's on July 23rd.   Bookseller and event host, Craig Beebe writes about the event - what he describes as a night he'll never forget.  ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great event, filled with lively discussion, fascinating stories, and a glimpse into history that I am sadly too young to have experienced. Clarence B. Jones is probably the most prominent person I have ever introduced, at Kepler's or anywhere. If you don't know his name offhand, that's not unusual--but he was a close friend and adviser to Martin Luther King from 1960 to 1968, joining initially as a member of his legal team and then becoming much closer over the years. Following King's assassination, Jones went on to have a very successful career in business; he was the first African American member of a major Wall Street investment firm, was named Fortune Magazine's Man of the Month twice, and counseled governments around the world on business matters. He was instrumental in the negotiations that ended the 1971 prison riots at Attica in New York, and has also gained acclaim as a producer and supporter of the arts. He received a White House Letter of Commendation from Bill Clinton, and in January was inducted into the &lt;a href="http://gainformer.com/Files/International%20Civil%20Rights%20Walk%20of%20Fame%20Inductees.htm"&gt;International Civil Rights Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta. He is currently a scholar in residence at the &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., Center&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a man of great experience, accomplishment, and importance in American civil rights history, but really American history in general. And yet, I found, he is a man of great humility and humor as well--who thanked not only the MLK Center but also the Federal Bureau of Investigation for helping him with his research for this book. (That was thanks to the many bugs they had on his phones during the period he worked with MLK--the transcripts of which are now declassified, including one in which he was admonishing his son to work harder in school!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised by the size of our crowd, as well. It's hard to tell with a figure like Mr. Jones, a man who doesn't have a household name and yet is known to many, whose book has been out for a couple of months already. But a sizable initial crowd occupied the first 50 chairs we put out (including what seemed to be an entire high school class with their teacher), and so we had to break out the extra chairs. As the event went on, and Clarence regaled us with stories of his relationship with MLK--such as how the great man wouldn't sit next to him when they went out to dinner because Clarence would always steal food off his plate!--additional customers seemed to realize this was something they didn't want to miss, and our crowd grew as the evening progressed.&lt;br /&gt;(This includes one gentleman who, as it turned out, was the grandson of a man Clarence had known, an editor and journalist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the 1960s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say a few words about the book. &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780061253201"&gt;What Would Martin Say?&lt;/a&gt; is Clarence's examination of how Dr. King might respond to some of the pressing issues of today, including affirmative action, terrorism and the war in Iraq, illegal immigration, and the state of current black leadership. Clarence uses King's writings, speeches, and their own interactions to create a highly readable and occasionally provocative book--I think it is safe to say (and Clarence would agree) that some of his conclusions are likely to be controversial, particularly regarding what Clarence believes King might say about illegal immigration and the methods of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. But he is very comfortable with that, and actually seems to revel in being provocative, as he said when he was discussing the upcoming presidential election as a referendum on race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beyond any controversial conclusions contained in the book, both it and his presentation on Wednesday were more fascinating for the stories and memories contained therein. For a young man like me--born over 20 years too late to have seen the Movement in full action, and robbed of the chance to hear Dr. King's voice today except on grainy videos--Clarence provides an amazing glimpse into the past, a front-row seat to witness the private conversations, jokes, and struggles that were not caught by any video camera (although many were caught by the FBI, as I mentioned earlier). Some of these stories are difficult. Audience members asked some questions about how Dr. King's awareness of the many threats he faced as such a figure, and it was clear that he knew there was a high likelihood he would be killed for his work. And yet he pressed on, along with so many brave people, in spite of the risks he knew that carried. Clarence is a testament to that, and has dedicated his life to preserving Dr. King's legacy, and fighting the many misappropriations of that legacy. Whatever one thinks of some of his conclusions, he is a great man and it was an honor to meet, host, and listen to him last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I was forced to cut him short, long before the evening would have naturally concluded--I think our audience and Clarence could have talked all night! I was told that was typical for Clarence's events; there is just so much to talk about, and he is such a great storyteller. Hearing his impression of Martin Luther King's preaching is something I'll never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, one of the more memorable evenings I had here at Kepler's. I'm grateful to Clarence Jones for the work he's done for equality in this country, work that is ongoing and probably will not be finished in our lifetimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;In case you missed seeing Clarence B. Jones at Kepler's, here's a clip from an interview with Tavis Smiley on PBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/o3NyHvIc0wA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/o3NyHvIc0wA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-would-martin-say.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9UNiCK7gI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/r6JDYM5KFBc/s72-c/clarence_jones.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-968128651776773311</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2008 18:13:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-07-29T11:26:25.666-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>The Grieving Garden</category><title>The Grieving Garden</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9eCbbzoxI/AAAAAAAAAIY/1iphpYHAFBA/s1600-h/susanne_redfern.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9eCbbzoxI/AAAAAAAAAIY/1iphpYHAFBA/s320/susanne_redfern.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228501088217572114" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a lovely and touching event. &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=the+grieving+garden&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The Grieving Garden&lt;/a&gt;, by local authors &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/pattyfisher/ci_9632492"&gt;Susan Gilbert and Suzanne Redfern, is a book with twenty-two contributors&lt;/a&gt;, all parents who have lost a child to death. The youngest child was a baby who died two days before she was born and the oldest was a 56-year-old woman who was killed in one of the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11, 2001. Seven of the contributors, including the authors, were in attendance at the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is quite remarkable in that the format is perfect for this topic and for the typical reader, which would likely be a parent who is seeking help and support after losing a child. The authors posed 24 questions to their contributors who then decided which questions they would answer. The book is divided into four parts, with several of the questions and answers making up the chapters in each part. The evocative result is that the reader feels as if she knows each contributor by the end of the book and has been privy to a remarkable and powerful journey. In my introduction, I quoted &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=john+donne&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;John Donne&lt;/a&gt; who said, "The death of each person [man] diminishes me..." Truly, each of these parent-writers were diminished by the loss of their child, but they have traveled the hills and valleys of their grief and have somehow become able to provide a gift to the community through this gentle and sensitive book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there were over a hundred people at the event, the atmosphere felt almost like a giant support group. The reading was also a benefit for &lt;a href="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=community-partners"&gt;Kepler's community partner, Kara&lt;/a&gt;, a local grief counseling organization, so many of the audience members had become aware of the event through &lt;a href="http://www.kara-grief.org/Reviews/Grieving%20Garden.htm"&gt;Kara's &lt;/a&gt;efforts. Thus, many, many of the people in attendance had either lost a loved one or were there to support someone who was grieving. The authors, who did a wonderful job describing the book and sharing the podium, were very sensitive to the stories of loss and questions that came from the audience.&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9gP6rsbPI/AAAAAAAAAIg/ZinYUaHFa30/s1600-h/2_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 208px; height: 156px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9gP6rsbPI/AAAAAAAAAIg/ZinYUaHFa30/s320/2_image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228503518967262450" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, some people could be seen weeping quietly and, scanning the crowd, I noticed others who were lost in thought about their missing loved one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9gjR3JMcI/AAAAAAAAAIo/mKizZdFg0K4/s1600-h/3_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 208px; height: 155px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9gjR3JMcI/AAAAAAAAAIo/mKizZdFg0K4/s320/3_image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228503851606815170" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those not in the "grief club" (who have not experienced the death of a loved one) may think this to be a sad and depressing event. However, while there was not a lot of laughter, a sense of comaraderie and gratitude enveloped the large audience as they settled into the safety of being around others who understood the complex experience of loss. Tellingly, we sold out of The Grieving Garden during the event, the first time that has occurred for me as a host.&lt;br /&gt;(This entry written by Kepler's event host, Bobbi Emel)</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/07/grieving-garden.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SI9eCbbzoxI/AAAAAAAAAIY/1iphpYHAFBA/s72-c/susanne_redfern.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-6932034337837730291</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2008 22:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-07-21T15:59:47.720-07:00</atom:updated><title>Robert Butler:  Longevity Revolution</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SIUSyEVQwFI/AAAAAAAAAIE/X468MevwZ6s/s1600-h/LongevityRevolution.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;

Forced out in 1937, he eventually found his way to the country whose legions he desperately wished to join: Nazi Germany.  The book provides compelling evidence that al-Husseini's actions and writings serve as inspirations today to the leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations pledged to destroy Israel and the United States. In fact he was responsible for translating &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Mein Kamf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt; into Arabic, and, to this day, it remains at the top of bestseller lists all over the Middle East. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/07/icon-of-evil-john-rothmann.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SIUQveUu1DI/AAAAAAAAAH8/Rym1BNxanjQ/s72-c/IconOfEvil.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-7414245435756651316</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:54:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-06-17T15:17:53.479-07:00</atom:updated><title>Andre Dubus III at Kepler's</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SFglRkiIyvI/AAAAAAAAAH0/m7ZtxFeCpC8/s1600-h/andre_dubus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt; and after confirming my Wikipedia tidbit about his stint as a bounty hunter he proceeded to read three sections from his new novel, each focusing on one of three protagonists.  The opening excerpt certainly caught everyone’s attention (even the staff over yonder): a skillful conjuring of a lap dance given by stripper April to the wealthy jihadist Bassam al-Jizani (this little entertainment netted Spring (her stage name) an obscene sum – see “wad of cash”, below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:16.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;During Q&amp;amp;A, the author of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=+0375727345&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The House of Sand and Fog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt; spoke extensively of the craft of writing.  His own philosophy closely parallels that of &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=flannery+o%27connor&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Flannery O’Connor&lt;/a&gt; whom he quoted:  “to make actual the mystery of our position on earth.”  Andre also made an interesting distinction between “making up stories” (what half of Hollywood does) and truly “imagining” them:  he believes that the fiction writer deals not in black and white, but rather in an elusive “gray” which is where humanity lay.  Exploring this gray area means listening to your characters, “allowing them to take the microphone” and make their case.  Such willingness to “commiserate intuitively” hopefully attunes readers to examine their own prejudices and develop an understanding of the characters’ humanity (in all its forms).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:16.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;Interestingly, Andre envisioned the 535 pp &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780393041651"&gt;The Garden of Last Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt; as a short story, the germ of which was a simple image: a wad of cash on a bureau…a woman’s bureau…a woman who works at a strip club...blood money…and so on.  It reminded me of &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Anne+Lamott&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Anne Lammott&lt;/a&gt;’s advice to writers in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780385480017"&gt;Bird by Bird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;: don’t be overwhelmed by the need for some Big Idea, but instead begin with some compelling image that’s been stuck in your head and start asking questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:16.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;Andre mentioned his research in preparation for the novel, citing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;The Far Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780805076523"&gt;The Devil’s Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt; as excellent sources (he also took a four month hiatus to read the Koran).  These admissions inevitably lead to a slew of interesting questions, a lively back-and-forth about the state of world affairs.  (At one point, Andre, impressed by one attendee’s persistence finally asked “What’s your name?”  It turns out the gentleman was the spouse of Angela Mann - one of the Kid Specialists in Kepler’s Youth Department.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:16.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;Andre kindly obliged when one audience member asked if the author would speak a bit about his father, the renowned short story writer Andre Dubus (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Dancing+after+Hours&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Dancing after Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;).  Andre III spoke fondly and frankly about Andre “II”: a French/Irish Louisiana boy who grew into a “wild” guy with a certain swagger.  Flirtatious (even with Andre’s own ex-girlfriends - “before my current wife, let’s be clear”), the senior Andre was also an extremely sensitive man, his keenly empathic perspective further deepening after an accident which left him wheelchair bound.  Andre summed up his father’s life-changing experience by quoting Leon Bloy: “Man has places in his heart which do not yet exist and into them enters suffering in order that they may have existence”.  He also referred the audience to his dad’s non-fiction collection &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Meditations+from+a+Movable+Chair&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Meditations from a Movable Chair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:16.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;Post-event, the polite Andre invited me to join him and some family and friends for libations next door at the BBC.  Quite the family man, Andre, carpenter and true believer in sweat equity, spoke of building his own house in the wooded Newbury, MA; home not only to his immediate family (“with each cedar shingle I nailed around my daughter’s circular window, I felt as though I was tucking her in bed”) but to his in-laws as well&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3C6BF0;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;(“you can learn so much from older people”).  Andre also reminisced about family re-unions on his property, himself turning up one year in a gorilla suit.  What can I say; Andre is a man with a lust for life! - and a great source for memorable quotes! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:16.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style=" ;font-family:Arial;font-size:17px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="  -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px;

In May, Kepler's floor manager Martin Sorenson blogged about just how far he would go for his favorite work of fiction this year.  Would he made it back in time to meet &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=david+benioff&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;David Benioff&lt;/a&gt; or miss it by that much? Read on to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~&lt;br /&gt;To start at the beginning… I was attending the &lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/"&gt;BEA convention&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles. I left the convention center at approximately 2:00pm, and endured the traffic to get to the airport with time to spare. Unfortunately, due to some odd security concerns, (None to do with me), we were roughly 35 minutes late taking off. I arrived at the store at a little before 7:00 pm to find set up all done and the staff ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great event. The book, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780670018703"&gt;City of Thieves&lt;/a&gt;, had received &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/13/DDL7106R6E.DTL"&gt;enthusiastic reviews&lt;/a&gt; from our staff who had read it. Before the event they were not shy about hand selling it either. As a result, when David Benioff arrived at the store, his book was number one on our hardcover fiction bestseller list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  He started speaking at 7:30, and read a section of his book that sets the stage for the rest of the novel. Feedback from the audience was very positive, with one customer telling me that when he started reading the excerpt it did not sound interesting, but by the end of the reading, he was ready to buy the book and have it signed. Another customer told Mr. Benioff that this was the first piece of fiction he had read in over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Q &amp;amp; A went very well, with customers asking him a host of questions both about the book, and about his other Hollywood projects. (He is also a scriptwriter.) The question was asked, how much of the book is real, since it is presented as his grandfather relating his war experiences during the siege of Leningrad. Mr. Benioff made sure to note that this was entirely a work of fiction. One of the best questions was about his work habits, and did he set aside a certain time of day to write. Mr. Benioff replied that he has always written late at night, and when he had a baby, was not sure how that would impact his writing schedule. It turned out that working at night worked perfectly, as it allowed his wife to sleep through the whole night while he was writing and taking care of his newborn. All in all, a splendid event, although I doubt I will ever do the LA to San Jose, back the next morning commute again.</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/06/david-benioff-at-keplers.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SE1Rgp3-7LI/AAAAAAAAAHk/vjKxRKJPAsw/s72-c/DavidBenioff.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-4093170116534124474</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2008 03:32:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-05-23T20:49:31.172-07:00</atom:updated><title>Eleanor Coppola - Notes on a Life</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeNAdDwHWI/AAAAAAAAAGs/FKRQJzOAJ8g/s1600-h/eleanor_coppola.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeNAdDwHWI/AAAAAAAAAGs/FKRQJzOAJ8g/s320/eleanor_coppola.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203782933389778274" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date: May 19, 2008&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author: &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780385524995"&gt;Eleanor Coppola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book: Notes on a Life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Host:  Bobbi Emel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would surmise that the matriarch of the film-making Coppola family might be flamboyant, commanding, larger-than-life. However, an occurrence after the event more accurately describes Eleanor Coppola: I offered her a gift book from Kepler's to thank her for coming to our store. "Oh," she said, genuinely pleased and surprised, "how nice!" She then went over to the bargain table, picked up a $12.99 book on photographer Ruth Berhard, and asked tentatively, "Is this too much?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Coppola arrived 20 minutes early to the event and, after looking around the store and commenting, "I've often heard of Kepler's! This is my first time here and I love it - it has a good feel to it," we went into the staff room to chat. She is a very quiet, reserved woman, with the centered energy of one who is an observer of life. Not a passive observer, but one with a keen eye for the art and passion of life. We talked about losing loved ones to death - she, her son in 1986, and I, my partner in 2004 - and what a profound experience it is. Now 72 years old, she told me, "The most important things in life are being grateful and forgiving everyone. Of course, you have to be older before you understand that."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the event, she read some selections from her book which, to me, is like a meditation: Mrs. Coppola observes moments in her life, expresses them with beautiful, compelling writing, then lets the moment go. She read pieces about a conceptual art event she and a friend staged at her house in the 70's ("Francis thought I was making fun of his Oscars and our house... he thought conceptual art was too easy,") and a current art installation that is a participatory experience for parents who have lost children to death ("We six collaborators were there waiting for him [Francis] to give his critique. He was silent. I looked over and saw a tear roll down his cheek. He said quietly, 'It works.'")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDePI9DwHXI/AAAAAAAAAG0/zbkOsckBUvk/s1600-h/Coppola2_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 241px; height: 259px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDePI9DwHXI/AAAAAAAAAG0/zbkOsckBUvk/s320/Coppola2_image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203785278441921906" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small audience was charmed by "the hidden Coppola," as she has been called. They asked questions about her documentaries, her costume designing, and a few about her relationship with Francis (Question: "Did you ever feel the need to compete with Francis?" Answer: "No. We're two very different people, with different artistic styles. Francis is big and operatic and my work is more about my observations.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDePY9DwHYI/AAAAAAAAAG8/ITso3WxV7tc/s1600-h/Coppola3_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 206px; height: 243px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDePY9DwHYI/AAAAAAAAAG8/ITso3WxV7tc/s320/Coppola3_image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203785553319828866" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She signed books and kindly answered more questions from customers.

I had not had time to look at the book and was thinking all sorts of stereotypical thoughts about having a scientist speak: it will be boring, he'll be too academic, too stuffy... grumble, grumble, grumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning from &lt;a href="http://www.cafeborrone.com/"&gt;Cafe Borrone &lt;/a&gt;with my mocha as a pathetic attempt to perk me up, I found the author was just checking in at the info desk. He turned to me, animated and congenial, "Hi! I'm &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search;jsessionid=abcAK73013Dubc_fI3yOr?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=stuart+kauffman&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Stu&lt;/a&gt;." Okay, so much for stuffiness. No "call me Dr. Kauffman" here. Stu introduced me to his cousin, Rich, who lives in Menlo Park and we all chatted for a few minutes about some of their adventures growing up together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Stu helped me feel comfortable with him immediately, I confessed that I had not had a chance to read his book and asked him for a nutshell version of it. In the middle of the main aisle, in front of the &lt;a href="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=book-clubs"&gt;Book Club&lt;/a&gt; display, Stu proceeded to give me the reasons why Reductionism is wrong, why the Darwinian notion of pre-adaptability doesn't work, why there is agency in the universe and the importance of that, and why it is important to distinguish between a Creator God and the natural creativity of the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a scientist. My background is in psychology and I understand only a little of the "hard" sciences. However, Stu made this conversation so interesting that we were late getting the event started because I became engrossed in the conversation. Not surprisingly, the same thing happened with the audience. Stu told me it was going to take him about an hour to give his talk. I explained that we usually had authors speak for half an hour and then take questions. We compromised at 45 minutes of speaking time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He spoke for an hour. I kept scanning the audience to check for signs of boredom or people looking at their watches. The faces I saw showed people who were both being entertained and educated at the same time. Stu speaks without notes about what some have termed his "God of complexity" theory and he is also quite witty. He is 68 years old yet defines the concept of his book as "Stu's Most Excellent Theory." So much for boring and academic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeHDNDwHSI/AAAAAAAAAGM/ejQ6kJO6SaE/s1600-h/StuartKauffman2_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 249px; height: 186px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeHDNDwHSI/AAAAAAAAAGM/ejQ6kJO6SaE/s320/StuartKauffman2_image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203776383564651810" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncharacteristically, I allowed the event to go 15 minutes over time as I could tell the audience continued to be riveted by his talk.

Her makeup was perfect and she looked younger than her 76 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;She shook hands with staff who came to greet her, her grip light and brief. In a quiet and delicate voice, and without looking at the person she was greeting, she murmured, "Hello" to each of us. She signed some stock and then came out to tackle the line which by now had snaked around the building and curled in on itself.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDSrWE39GJI/AAAAAAAAAE8/HQ9InkVpqCA/s1600-h/line+around+store.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDSrWE39GJI/AAAAAAAAAE8/HQ9InkVpqCA/s320/line+around+store.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5202971865273669778" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Ms. Walters signed each book then looked up at the person and, in that same quiet, delicate voice, said earnestly, "Thank you for coming." Fans were thrilled to be close to her.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some people were so moved by the experience that they wept. One young woman, perhaps 16 or 17 years old, came up to Ms. Walters and said, with a wavering voice, "I've been watching you all my life. I've wanted to be a journalist since I was 10 years old because of you!" With that, the young lady burst into tears. Ms. Walters smiled up at her and said, "How sweet! I'm sure you'll be very good."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;There were a lot of people to greet and books to sign, but there were some that Ms. Walters took time to give special attention, especially the elderly and children. She often teased parents that she would like to take their child home with her and then gently asked each child a question about him/herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Many elderly fans braved the heat to have their books signed as well. One woman was being pushed in a wheelchair by her daughter. The publicist handed the older woman's book to Ms. Walters. "Make it out to Gracie," the woman commanded. Ms. Walters, who had not been personalizing the books, complied. "Well," she said, "with an order like that, I better not refuse." The older woman's daughter smiled and somewhat apologetically said, "She's 102." For a moment, the woman in the wheelchair was more popular than Ms. Walters. 102! All of us, including Ms. Walters, felt that we needed to shake the centenarian's hand, as if hoping some of the longevity would rub off on us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Ms. Walters continued to be gracious throughout, encouraging a cancer survivor going through chemo to be strong, telling a woman who worked with people with disabilities that she was a hero, and gently scolding those of us who were managing the line to "please don't push him away" when a man who had presented her with two books he had written was going on at length to her about his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDStFk39GNI/AAAAAAAAAFc/_cWqXeIzbMw/s1600-h/BarbaraWalters3_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDStFk39GNI/AAAAAAAAAFc/_cWqXeIzbMw/s320/BarbaraWalters3_image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5202973780829083858" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;She inquired a few times as to the length of the remaining line of fans, but always told people who asked that her signing hand was "just fine."&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Finally, the end of the line appeared at the door and the last few customers left with smiles on their faces, copies of &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780307266460"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under their arms.

From the moment that he walked up to the library (looking everyone in the eye, shaking hands, a big smile at the ready) to the moment he left (hugs and hand shakes all around), he made every person that he came in contact with feel as if he really cared and that he was happy to have you around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Equally warm and sweet was his writing partner Lin Oliver who accompanied him on this tour.  She is a writer and producer of children and family programming and movies and is co-founder and Executive Director of &lt;a href="http://www.scbwi.org/"&gt;The Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators&lt;/a&gt;.  It was easy to see why the two work so well together, as they have an excellent rapport.  Plus, Henry is very attentive to the fact that they are co-authors.  He was quick to downplay his celebrity in favor of her presence and contribution to their work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After a quick snack of New York Style pizza courtesy of “Chewie” from Escape from New York Pizza (A big fan, Chewie called us earlier in the week to see if he could deliver pizza for Henry), Henry and Lin sat down for an interview with a San Jose magazine reporter.  Pretty soon, it was show time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The two took the stage and had the audience laughing and smiling from the moment they started talking.  Despite a wireless microphone snafu, Henry and Lin were relaxed and enthusiastic.  He told the story of him growing up and wanting to be an actor from the age of 3, his experiences growing up with dyslexia and how it affected his acting career, and then he and Lin discussed how they write the books and where they get their ideas.  Here are some pictures of them talking.  Notice the woman in the front row wearing the white capris…she is related to an eccentric woman whom Henry borrowed the last name of Zipzer from for his main character’s surname:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeSnNDwHZI/AAAAAAAAAHE/OdOJe__8NF4/s1600-h/Fonzimage002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 277px; height: 208px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeSnNDwHZI/AAAAAAAAAHE/OdOJe__8NF4/s320/Fonzimage002.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203789096667848082" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeTQNDwHaI/AAAAAAAAAHM/XGBz5QLxZ3I/s1600-h/Fonzimage003.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 280px; height: 211px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeTQNDwHaI/AAAAAAAAAHM/XGBz5QLxZ3I/s320/Fonzimage003.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203789801042484642" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry also did dramatic readings from a few of his books, which were spot on in tone and full of animation.  I know, I know, he is a professional actor and he is supposed to be good at giving readings.  Still, it was magical to watch.  A little bit like live theater.  What is even more impressive is when you factor in his dyslexia.  It is still very difficult for him to read out loud, yet he did it flawlessly.  Someone actually asked him about that and he said in his early acting days, when he would read for parts, casting directors would say, “You didn’t read the lines the way they are written.”  To which Henry replied that he was giving them the “essence of the character”.  It worked to his advantage because, well, he got the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I could go on and on about this event, but I won’t because I want to get to the best part of the night, THE SIGNING LINE!  As I’ve mentioned, Henry is dyslexic and the character in his books is dyslexic too.  As you may guess, there were many kids in the audience who had a learning disability.  It was touching to watch him speak to them.  When a child came up to him who tearfully said that he couldn’t play sports because of his learning disability, Henry put down his Sharpie, held the boy’s hand and spoke to him in a soft reassuring voice.  He told him that he had intelligent eyes and that he could tell that he was really smart.  He told him not to give up.  And some other things that I couldn’t quite hear, but I could tell were making a profound impression on the little boy.  His parents were beaming as they left the table.  So was the little boy.  There were many, many moments like that.  Lots of giggling from the kids as they posed for pictures with Henry as he told them not to laugh which made them laugh even more.  It was one of the best times that I have ever had running a signing line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Everyone was sad to see him go, but we knew that it had to end.  As a final favor to me, he posed with me for a picture so that I could prove to my mom that I really worked with Henry Winkler:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeTl9DwHbI/AAAAAAAAAHU/y1FTHErd1N4/s1600-h/Fonzimage006.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 298px; height: 225px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeTl9DwHbI/AAAAAAAAAHU/y1FTHErd1N4/s320/Fonzimage006.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203790174704639410" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note.  On Monday morning I had a voice mail message from Henry saying that he had a good time with Kepler’s and he thanked us for a “wonderful, wonderful event”.  He may not have said it, but I feel like he was giving us a great big “EHHHH!”</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/05/henry-winkler.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDeWiNDwHcI/AAAAAAAAAHc/BU-ZFqmMzog/s72-c/henry_winkler.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-5471530294967659724</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2008 23:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-05-21T16:48:43.953-07:00</atom:updated><title>Andrew Sean Greer "The Story of a Marriage"</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDS0wE39GRI/AAAAAAAAAF8/DCXSszG_-Mg/s1600-h/AndrewSeanGreer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDS0wE39GRI/AAAAAAAAAF8/DCXSszG_-Mg/s320/AndrewSeanGreer.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5202982207554918674" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite an unexpected and forbidding heat, some 30 diehard fans overcame their malaise to hear Andrew Sean Greer read from his new novel, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780374108663"&gt;"The Story of a Marriage"&lt;/a&gt;.  The author himself was convinced that people would "bag" his event to leisurely sip wine in the shade at impromptu picnics.  So, Kepler's supporters, the store and Andrew thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an introduction by Kepler's bookseller &lt;em&gt;nonpareil,&lt;/em&gt; Nancy Salmon, the linen-clad Andrew struck a near instant rapport with his audience: he longingly recalled an evening some eight years ago when a handful of curious (prescient?) people turned out at Kepler's for his first ever author event, a reading for his elegant 2000 short story collection &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=how+it+was+for+me&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;"How It Was for Me"&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully, the author of the best-selling "&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=The+Confessions+of+Max+Tivoli&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The Confessions of Max Tivoli&lt;/a&gt;" is enjoying "how it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for me" now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its core, "The Story of a Marriage" poses a question: how can we ever truly know another person? Andrew mentioned that due to numerous plot twists and a key revelation early in the novel, he's encountered difficulty discussing the book in interviews.  Nonetheless, he chose to read a dramatic passage fully 2/3 of the way in: an episode in which the struggling marrieds take the Larkspur Ferry one summer evening to a dance in Marin.  Sharing a cab home with another man, the wife, Pearlie Cook, after misreading her fellow passenger, is unnerved by his sudden, unexpected overtures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Q&amp;amp;A, Andrew spoke of relocating from urban NYC to the University of Montana to earn his MFA under the tutelage of esteemed writer &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=william+kittredge&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;William Kittredge ("Hole in the Sky: a Memoir").&lt;/a&gt;  While some students wrote stories in a tone of ironic machismo reflecting the region's rugged terrain, Andrew composed more emotional stories borne of his youthful experiences.  He felt somewhat redeemed when Mr. Kittredge - himself a rather "gruff" guy - admonished his students that if they don't risk bumping up against the edge of sentimentality, then they "just don't get it."   When asked why he doesn't write with that "irony" so common among his contemporaries, Andrew's answer is a resignedly honest "I just can't" (with any conviction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first query of Q&amp;amp;A was the simple "Why 1953?"  Andrew found this particular era - known for its Cold War paranoia, simmering suburban angst, and suppression of certain social groups (women, blacks, gays) - the perfect milieu for his story of an exceptionally frustrating marriage scarred by deception. To understand the cultural texture and nuances of 1950's San Francisco, Andrew tapped the microfiche* archives at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library (the one with the cavernous, three-story high, architecturally exquisite reading room - ok, so I'm a Cal alum). After pouring over daily editions of the SF Chronicle (from which he created a nifty binder &lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;w/table of contents - "hey, anything but write, right?"), he fixated on 1953 after being captivated by certain of the year's details:  the national ambivalence toward the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg; President Eisenhower's call for citizens to burn their copies of Marx and Engels' "Das Kapital"; the surprisingly pronounced prejudice against Chinese immigrants in a not yet progressive San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;*Those of us of a certain pre - "point-and-click" era, when research was a labor intensive affair requiring travel, will surely recall scrolling, scanning, and finally, while squeezed in some cramped, subterranean carrel, no less, staring fixedly at those 10X magnified, oddly distorted, backlit sheets of microfiche, those modern equivalents of the &lt;em&gt;illuminated manuscript&lt;/em&gt;, hoping to locate - at a nickel a pop anything worth printing out!  The comparatively loud machine even involved - I think - a hand crank of sorts.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew also told of discovering - while researching "Max Tivoli" - an authentic diary of an 1880's male adolescent; a rather "dull" read until the author realized that the sporadic gibberish - cryptically followed by a series of numerals - was in fact the naughty teenager's code for certain girls' identities (as listed in the "glossary") and the corresponding number of 'ol bases he'd been to with them (Victorianism be damned).  This decoding made for a quite vivid re-reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a another interesting aside, Andrew admitted to stealing the last sentence from a classic &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=jane+austen&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Jane Austen&lt;/a&gt; novel to end "The Story of a Marriage".  (Forgive me, but I can't recall the Austen title, or, frankly, if it was indeed Austen).  This literary maneuver was part of some sort of bet Andrew had with fellow writer and Jane Austen fan, Julie Orringer ("How to Breathe Underwater"*) who had always wanted to do the same. (I guess Andrew beat her to the punch.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;*a terrific collection that I highly recommend; the book's final story "Stations of the Cross" kind'a blew me away.  Plus, you just have to love the catty title of another - "When She is Old and I am Famous".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew mentioned that he is currently at work on a novel.  All in all, the evening was an enjoyable "reunion" for bookstore and author alike.~~Terry Meagher</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/05/andrew-sean-greer-story-of-marriage.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDS0wE39GRI/AAAAAAAAAF8/DCXSszG_-Mg/s72-c/AndrewSeanGreer.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-7079341260440791782</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2008 16:08:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-05-15T10:44:08.352-07:00</atom:updated><title>New Release Review - City of Thieves</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SCxkw039GEI/AAAAAAAAAEU/E8UMbRmevRU/s1600-h/DavidBenioff.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SCxkw039GEI/AAAAAAAAAEU/E8UMbRmevRU/s320/DavidBenioff.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5200642459695913026" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=david+benioff&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;David Benioff&lt;/a&gt;'s new book, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780670018703"&gt;City of Thieves&lt;/a&gt;, comes out TODAY and no one is more excited than Kepler's Martin Sorensen.  Read on to see how far our fearless floor leader will go for his favorite book.&lt;br /&gt;~~~&lt;br /&gt;There are some books that just come at you out of left field. You pick up the book because it looks interesting, and the story as it unwinds is so different from what you expected, your chin just hits the floor. City of Thieves is just such a book. While it takes place during the siege of Leningrad, it is not primarily a war story. And while it is narrated by a grandfather recalling his actions at age 15, it is not just a coming of age story. And while most of the book takes place while the characters are traveling, it’s definitely not &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780142437254"&gt;On the Road&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how you define it though, it is an extremely gripping, enjoyable book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some books that just leave you breathless. City of Thieves is my favorite piece of fiction that I have read so far this year. My reaction to reading it was so positive; I got in touch with the publisher to let them know how much I enjoyed it. Several days later, the author, David Benioff, was booked to speak at Kepler’s with myself as host. Unfortunately, I was scheduled to be in Los Angeles at the time for a book convention. However, the chance to meet someone who suddenly is now one of my ‘hardcover authors’*, overrode most other considerations.  So, I will be leaving Los Angeles convention center at 2 in the afternoon, flying up here to host the event, and flying back the very first thing the next morning. Yes, it is that good of a book. I hope to see you here for his reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=programs-events&amp;amp;subsec=upcoming-events#540"&gt;  David Benioff will be at Kepler's on Friday May 30, 2008 at 7:30 p.m.  Mark your calendars&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A Hardcover author is someone whose books I buy the day the hit the store regardless of subject. It could be a history of the Portland phone directory for all the difference it would make in my purchasing the book.</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-release-review-city-of-thieves.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SCxkw039GEI/AAAAAAAAAEU/E8UMbRmevRU/s72-c/DavidBenioff.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-2641959803279642562</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2008 23:52:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-05-21T17:05:06.797-07:00</atom:updated><title>Aleksandar Sasha Hemon</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.keplers.com/_images/authors/aleksandar_hemon.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 124px; height: 351px;" src="http://www.keplers.com/_images/authors/aleksandar_hemon.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:georgia;font-size:100%;color:black;"   &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;On May 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;sup style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;, 2008 Kepler's welcomed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-family: georgia;" href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=aleksandar+hemon&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Aleksandar Sasha Hemon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;, reading from his new book "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-family: georgia;" href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781594489884"&gt;The Lazarus Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;," a novel interspersed with evocative black-and-white photographs, some shot by his friend photographer Velimir Bozovic, others found in the Chicago Historical Society archives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;p  style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-size:100%;color:black;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;In my introduction I retold a story I heard from Patrick Hunt, an archaeologist at Stanford, who spoke about his trip to Machu Picchu, the Lost City of the Incas (check his book&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=+%22Ten+Discoveries+that+Rewrote+History%22&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=+%22Ten+Discoveries+that+Rewrote+History%22&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0" title="http://www.patrickhunt.net/books/books.html#ten" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;"Ten Discoveries that Rewrote History"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Patrick was sitting there on the mountain one day, when he noticed how the spot was cone-shaped, like a huge megaphone made of granite walls, like an amphitheater, so he took his flute out and started playing a simple song, no more then ten notes. To his astonishment the sound came back to him. He kept playing, and each new theme echoed back to him perfectly harmonized. Some people were beginning to sit down, to listen. After he stopped playing, all those flute harmonies still echoed for a while and when the music finally faded away a triple rainbow opened up. So, he thought, this is all too much, I better go now. Then he realized that the 30-40 people who came to sit around him and listen were all local Catchuas. One little man came up to him and said in broken Spanish, "Signor, tu es un amauta (high priest)." The little man explained that he just heard him perform with his flute an ancestral Catchuan ritual that had been lost for over 500 years. And then the little man asked, "What else do you know?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story reminded me of reading Aleksandar Sasha Hemon's writing and his way of making his home in English, an outsider at first who came to United States with just a basic command of English and who became an amauta, a high priest (scholar), in linguistic terms comparable to &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Vladimir+Nabokov&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=Joseph+Conrad&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Joseph Conrad&lt;/a&gt;. He published his first book,  a short-story collection "&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=The+Question+of+Bruno%22&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The Question of Bruno"&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and his second,  a novel "&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780385499248"&gt;Nowhere Man"&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p  style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-size:100%;color:black;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;I read in an interview that his wife, one of his first editors, would gently correct him by saying, "Sasha, we don't say that like that in English," to which he would lovingly respond, "But darling, now we do!" In Sasha, the MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" winning author of three very important books, we can see why the place or the language doesn't belong only to those born into it. It belongs to those who make us see it again, as if for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sasha thanked me for the introduction and said that he was never called a priest before, but that he might consider starting a church of his own - after all, it seems to be a profitable business! During his reading, the DVD of the photos continuously played in the background.  The overhead lights were dimmed. One particularly arresting photograph showed Lazarus Averbuch ((19-year-old Eastern European immigrant) sitting upright in a chair, his hands folded in his lap, and an older man in black suit and cylinder hat, standing behind dead Lazarus and holding his head. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:100%;" &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Hemon’s inspiration for his book came exactly from this 1908 photograph. Hemon was motivated by this tragedy, the death of the young man who escaped pogrom only to be shot inside the home of Chicago Police Chief George Shippy. He wanted to re-create Lazarus's life and to honor the grief and hope of immigrant dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p  style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-size:100%;color:black;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;In fact, Hemon's slideshow and reading induced almost a dream state in which our eyes followed the story of the photographs while our ears listened to Hemon's storyteller voice tell a story of a young Bosnian writer’s voyage to Lazarus’ home village Kishinev (today’s Moldova).  ~~~ Aggie Zivaljevic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDS4aU39GSI/AAAAAAAAAGE/d9nhMCN4gjE/s1600-h/image002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDS4aU39GSI/AAAAAAAAAGE/d9nhMCN4gjE/s320/image002.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5202986231939275042" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p  style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-size:100%;color:black;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;color:black;"   &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/05/aleksandar-sasha-hemon.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SDS4aU39GSI/AAAAAAAAAGE/d9nhMCN4gjE/s72-c/image002.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-1035104995662042545</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 04:25:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-04-29T19:27:29.682-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Tobias Wolff</category><title>Tobias Wolff - "Our Story Begins"</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfRNXy80aI/AAAAAAAAAEM/YPE6PmZeVgE/s1600-h/tobias_wolff.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfRNXy80aI/AAAAAAAAAEM/YPE6PmZeVgE/s320/tobias_wolff.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194850722851377570" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tobias Wolff came to Kepler's on April 28.  Bookseller/blogger extraordinaire, Terry Meagher, hosted the evening.  In case you couldn't make it, here's how the evening went in Terry's words.~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;It's always interesting to contrast the store's peaceful atmosphere during those waning moments prior to closing - when the last handful of stubborn patrons are slowly lulled to the exit by that rhythmically croaking chorus of frogs that night manager Chuck insists on playing - with the energetic ambience of a packed house at one of our author events.  I'm referring here not to that crazed excitement of a maddening, midnight-sale crowd at some big-box retailer, but rather to the civilized, expectant energy of a community of readers gathered to show its appreciation: in this case, for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/books/review/Schillinger-t.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;one of our foremost practitioners of the short story form&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search;jsessionid=abc6jd7ra-OF18sOMcDMr?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=tobias+wolff&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Tobias (a.k.a Toby) Wolff&lt;/a&gt; and his collection of new stories and selected classics &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781400044597"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Our Story Begins".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt; &lt;p&gt;Tobias arrived promptly at 7P and despite the darkly unnerving quality of his fiction, the author was hardly the&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfQZny80ZI/AAAAAAAAAEE/zjAU3G4O304/s1600-h/tobby%27s+fans.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 260px; height: 230px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfQZny80ZI/AAAAAAAAAEE/zjAU3G4O304/s320/tobby%27s+fans.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194849833793147282" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; brooding figure, but a rather robust, nearly "happy-go-lucky" kind'a guy.  He made a pit stop in the Ordering department, merrily signing stock and discussing with &lt;a href="http://keplers.com/?sec=new-and-recommended&amp;amp;subsec=franks-picks"&gt;Frank - our Head Buyer &lt;/a&gt;-  the finer points of &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780374279127"&gt;Denis Johnson's National Book Award winning novel &lt;em&gt;Tree of Smoke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (while I dutifully flapped book jackets to the title page).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I began with an introduction, highlighting a few of Toby's stories that particularly moved me, but was - and this is a first - interrupted at the mention of his new story "Her Dog" by the hand waving author himself "No further, please!" The censure was legit, as the story was one of two he planned to read that evening. (After a flustered moment or two, I regrouped, and the evening proceeded normally)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobias read two stories: "Say Yes", ostensibly a conversation about race between a husband and wife, and the aforementioned "Her Dog", an inventive narrative that evolves into an imagined dialogue between a dog and its negligent owner. Toby was quite forthcoming during Q&amp;amp;A. He spoke of the early influences on his decision to pursue writing. One inspiration was the author &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=albert+terhune&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Albert Terhune&lt;/a&gt;, a writer who wrote a great many books all from the point of view of collie, stories that Toby, as a child, found fascinating (perhaps this explains the recurrence of dogs in his own stories).  Also, he just loved to write stories as a kid, bartering with lazy classmates: "you write my story and I'll give you my lunch candy for a week" kind'a deals.  His confidence was shaken when one of his ghost written stories received a "C" (a "C"?!) and quickly restored, enhanced even, when the teacher revealed she was simply punishing the student for cheating, knowing full well the exceptional story had been by Tobias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toby is attracted to the short story form because it allows him to work "under the illusion" of perfecting something. He is not unlike the sculptor; paring down, polishing until all that remains is the story's absolute essence. Unlike some other writers - &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=joyce+carol+oates&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Joyce Carol Oates&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps even &lt;a href="http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/04/alexander-mccall-smith-at-keplers.html"&gt;Alexander McCall Smith&lt;/a&gt;? (see Bobbi Emel's event report of 4/22) - from whom the words just seem to flow endlessly and easily, Toby must constantly rewrite - which he actually loves - because at this point he is over his anxiety of getting the full idea of the story on paper. Toby also pointed out that once a story is published, out there in the world, it really does assume a life of its own; meanings and interpretations are now in the hands of readers. A high school teacher eagerly popped up from his chair and wanted to know about the symbolism of the wife's bleeding finger in "Say Yes" - "I tell my students it represents the idea that regardless of skin color we all bleed red". Toby is fine with this interpretation, though it was his intention that story be not about race at all, but rather about the wife discovering that her husband's love is conditional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bringing this same concentrated attention of short story writing to the novel is somewhat intimidating for Tobias.  &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780375401466"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old School&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took 4 1/2 years to write, and given Toby's "high sensitivity to mortality" he often feared "what if I'm struck by a bus? Two whole years of work for naught!  Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Old School&lt;/em&gt;, Toby went on at some length when someone posed a question about the novel's narrator, who apparently comes under the spell of that founder of Objectivism, philosopher &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=ayn+rand&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Ayn Rand&lt;/a&gt;, author of the still briskly selling &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780452286375"&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780452011878"&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the un-ironic &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780451163936"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtue of Selfishness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;  Toby admitted having been under the sway of the philosopher himself during his younger days, much to the consternation of friends. While Toby feels Rand perhaps originally had a point, he eventually dismissed the philosophy of the woman who proudly "has never been helped by anyone in my life" as ridiculous and somewhat mean-spirited. Read her &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781585674060"&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt;, Toby said, and you'll see she was blatantly helped left and right all her life.  (Apparently, the intransigent Ms. Rand was known to publicly reduce to tears her own supporters who - perhaps in an enlightened "What's wrong with this picture?" moment, dared to challenge her philosophical precepts.  Tobias slyly mentioned that the &lt;a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=index"&gt;Ayn Rand Institute&lt;/a&gt; itself eventually reasoned - coldly and correctly, of course - that it would be in the organization's own selfish, best interest if Ms. Rand cease all public engagement with her disciples, insisting she stick to pen and paper..... Alas, what a great blogger that Ms. Rand would have made!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The signing went smoothly. Toby kindly offered to personalize books, even signing those stacks of backlist titles that a couple of deadly serious collectors brought in. (Even I had fun meeting our customers while writing out personalized messages on slips of paper - though I felt oddly waiter-like, my post-it pad and pen in hand, held up to my face, as I went through the long line, half wanting to say " and our Special tonight is "Our Story Begins...".)  I also got to chat with Toby's friendly spouse, Catherine, while handing copy after copy of &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780375401466"&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=this+boys+life&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;This Boys Life&lt;/a&gt;, etc., to Tobias to sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;" &gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfNJHy80XI/AAAAAAAAAD0/NDfxgheVs68/s1600-h/tobias+and+terry.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 236px; height: 240px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfNJHy80XI/AAAAAAAAAD0/NDfxgheVs68/s320/tobias+and+terry.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194846251790422386" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;Terry (left) with Tobias Wolff (right)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;"  &gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/04/tobias-wolff-our-story-begins.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBfRNXy80aI/AAAAAAAAAEM/YPE6PmZeVgE/s72-c/tobias_wolff.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-2617137329602849401</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2008 19:38:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-04-25T12:13:46.128-07:00</atom:updated><title>Alexander McCall Smith at Kepler's!</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDqzXy80PI/AAAAAAAAACw/Ezjh8jS5C9g/s1600-h/alexander_mccall_smith.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDqzXy80PI/AAAAAAAAACw/Ezjh8jS5C9g/s320/alexander_mccall_smith.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192908538640126194" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crowd of 350 fans came to Kepler's for a night with &lt;a href="http://www.mccallsmith.com/"&gt;Alexander McCall Smith&lt;/a&gt;, author of more than 50 books, including the bestselling &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781400034772"&gt;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=isabel+dalhousie&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Isabel Dalhousie series.&lt;/a&gt; On April 22nd, he was in town to talk about his newest novel, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search;jsessionid=abcK6I0IOomQ8hMwnccMr?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=the+miracle+at+speedy+motors&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The Miracle at Speedy Motors&lt;/a&gt;.  And as event host and bookseller, Bobbi Emel, reports, it was indeed an evening to remember.  ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Mr. McCall Smith is a very courteous, charming, and funny man. He offered to sign stock while waiting for the event to begin and also met with a few fans privately, including my mother who came down from the great state of Washington for the event. Mrs. McCall Smith and friend wanted to browse and shop in the store and were very impressed with the layout and selection at Kepler's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Meanwhile, the crowd waited patiently outside and staff distributed colored tickets for them to use for the book-signing procedure.  Finally, they were brought in and we ended up with quite a large audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDlony80JI/AAAAAAAAACA/q8R7QECCilg/s1600-h/McCallSmithCrowd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDlony80JI/AAAAAAAAACA/q8R7QECCilg/s320/McCallSmithCrowd.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192902856398393490" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://menlopark.keplers.com/exchange/Kelly/Inbox/Alexander%20McCall%20Smith%20-%20April%2022.EML/1_multipart/2_multipart/2_image.jpg?Security=3" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;They waited patiently as I extolled the virtues of literary circle membership, talked up the Kepler's Blog, touted upcoming events, and reviewed basics about keeping the aisles clear and signing line procedures. Spontaneous applause from the audience was, alas, not for my thorough pre-intro but for Mr. McCall Smith who had left the green room and appeared to my right. I provided a brief introduction about the author (which was a little difficult given his extensive education, wide range of interests, and multiple ongoing series of stories) and then he took the podium. Almost instantly, he had the audience laughing with delight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDl8ny80KI/AAAAAAAAACI/-Pz6Ystvn6Q/s1600-h/McCallSmith2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDl8ny80KI/AAAAAAAAACI/-Pz6Ystvn6Q/s320/McCallSmith2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192903199995777186" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://menlopark.keplers.com/exchange/Kelly/Inbox/Alexander%20McCall%20Smith%20-%20April%2022.EML/1_multipart/2_multipart/3_image.jpg?Security=3" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Mr. McCall Smith (AMS) picked up on something I had mentioned in the intro, the fact that he and his wife had created a musical group called "&lt;a href="http://thereallyterribleorchestra.com/"&gt;The Really Terrible Orchestra"&lt;/a&gt; in which he plays bassoon and Elizabeth plays the horn. AMS said, in his very droll manner, that I had misspoken. Although he does play the bassoon it must be said more accurately that he only plays "half the bassoon. The high notes are very hard to play so when the music gets to a D, I stop. Of course, most of the players in The Really Terrible Orchestra also employ this procedure when their music goes too high, as well, so really, we are simply, simply awful." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;AMS continued on in this manner, speaking without notes, telling stories on himself that were extremely funny and kind-heartedly making fun of people he has met throughout his life. (A story about a trip to &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=santa+barbara&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Santa Barbara &lt;/a&gt;was told with AMS gently recalling the denizens of that fair city as "Santa Barbarians.") He quickly reviewed the status of the storylines in his &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781400034772"&gt;No. 1 Detective Ladies' Agency&lt;/a&gt; series as well as in his other series and then confessed to the audience that he has a serious condition known as "serial novelism." &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=mccall+smith&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;(He has written over 50 books.) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;After 30 minutes of highly entertaining speaking (loud guffawing could be heard from Receiving where the host and Pam were sitting in the wings, watching), AMS took questions from the audience. An extremely polite man, he thanked each person for his/her question but could not help laughing at one woman's query. Referring to his &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=scotland+and+mccall+smith&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;"Scotland Yard" series&lt;/a&gt;, the woman noted that it was implied that one of the characters, Pat, had been through a traumatic experience in her past. The woman then earnestly asked, "So...do you know what happened to Pat?" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Answering another question, he revealed that he writes for 3 hours every day and writes 1000 words per hour. He also does not edit his work or change the story in any way, it just flows out of him. My mother had asked him previously how he was able [in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series] to write from the perspective of a "middle-aged, Botswanian woman of traditional build" to which he simply answered "imagination."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Truly, Mr. McCall Smith held the imaginations of all of us in the audience that night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDnG3y80NI/AAAAAAAAACg/BUAUIw-0ELA/s1600-h/McCallSmith3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDnG3y80NI/AAAAAAAAACg/BUAUIw-0ELA/s320/McCallSmith3.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192904475601064146" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;He preferred to stand while signing books and was very quick about it while making each customer feel that s/he was the only person in the room with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://menlopark.keplers.com/exchange/Kelly/Inbox/Alexander%20McCall%20Smith%20-%20April%2022.EML/1_multipart/2_multipart/4_image.jpg?Security=3" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDmzny80MI/AAAAAAAAACY/RGoxXOIMW1g/s1600-h/McCallSmith4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBDmzny80MI/AAAAAAAAACY/RGoxXOIMW1g/s320/McCallSmith4.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192904144888582338" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;As you can tell from this report, I wa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;s delighted with AMS and the event as a whole. And one of the great things&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; about being a host is writing these reports and being able to insert pictures of yourself, your mom, and the author.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://menlopark.keplers.com/exchange/Kelly/Inbox/Alexander%20McCall%20Smith%20-%20April%2022.EML/1_multipart/2_multipart/5_image.jpg?Security=3" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Special thanks to Cynthia and Mom for the photos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Additional thanks go out to Pam, Frank, Jeff, Noam, the night crew, volunteer Pam, Ann Dreeszen and her mom, Jean, Cynthia, Marilyn A. for manning the outside Mobi, and Jonathan for setting up the AV.

It was a cool April evening, but a family crowd gathered to celebrate her newest tale,  &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780375840906"&gt;The Penderwicks on Gardam Street&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:georgia;font-size:100%;"&gt;Kepler's Children's Events Coordinator, Angela Kroner, is the artistic and talented mind behind all of our fabulous children's events.  She recreated the Penderwicks world on the plaza - complete with piano music, butterfly wings, bunnies, brownies and more.  Here's a recap of a magical evening, in Angela's words.  ~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;This was our first attempt at an evening outdoor event.  And, thanks to the tremendous effort of the people that helped me set up, I think that it works quite well.  The traffic noise wasn’t too bad although the train was intrusive.  We were able to fit quite a few chairs out there, so hopefully, we can start to considerate it for an alternative venue during the warmer summer months!  It never hurts to have people driving by actually see what one of our events looks like!  Here are some pictures of what it looked like:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD4-ny80RI/AAAAAAAAADA/ko1poVVZgo8/s1600-h/JeanneBirdsall1-42108.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD4-ny80RI/AAAAAAAAADA/ko1poVVZgo8/s320/JeanneBirdsall1-42108.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192924125076443410" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD5OXy80SI/AAAAAAAAADI/cS3TwP0EGHY/s1600-h/JeanneBirdsall2-42108.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD5OXy80SI/AAAAAAAAADI/cS3TwP0EGHY/s320/JeanneBirdsall2-42108.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192924395659383074" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD5OXy80SI/AAAAAAAAADI/cS3TwP0EGHY/s1600-h/JeanneBirdsall2-42108.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; Jeanne, of course, was a delight.  (Angela Mann had the opportunity to conduct and interview with her prior to the event - keep checking the blog - we'll post that soon!)  She started right off by saying that &lt;a href="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=about-keplers&amp;amp;subsec=the-keplers-story"&gt;people needed to support their independent book stores&lt;/a&gt; because they are the ones that out there fighting the good fight.  She was quick to point out that it was the independents that made her first book such a success and if it wasn’t for them, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=the+penderwicks&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;The Penderwicks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may have languished.  It was a nice message to convey to the kids, as they are the future customers and supporters of stores like ours!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;    She talked mostly about where the ideas for the story lines come from and it seems that she pulls quite a bit from the classics.  Its obvious, really, but she still managed to write two books that have a modern, yet classic feel to them.  The influences she cited were &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=nesbit%2C+edith&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Nesbit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;fromauthor=yes&amp;amp;author=45840"&gt;Alcott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=munro+leaf&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Munro Leaf&lt;/a&gt;, and a score of others.  She also pulled quite a bit from her own family—human and pets.  (Her son…or was it step-son…is a student at Stanford and he was there.  She kept on referring to him and the things that he and his siblings did while they were growing up, telling him to stand up and answer questions.  He took this with much good humor.)  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;     The questions from the audience were intelligent and she answered them with great honesty. Her favorite question came from a young man who started off his question with, “My mom says…”  To which Jeanne replied, “Any question that starts off with that phrase is a good question.”  (Or something along those lines.)  He proceeded to say that his mom said that in order to have a good book, it’s a good idea to start off with some sort of tragedy like killing off a parent.   This made the whole audience and Jeanne laugh hysterically.  She said that this was a good theory, but that she certainly was not advocating killing parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;     One last side note:  Author Robin Brande (&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=evolution%2C+me+and+other+freaks&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Evolution, Me and Other Freaks of Nature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) was there and the two of them got along really well.  Apparently, they have the same editor and spent the end of the night talking and laughing about the touring circuit.  Here is a picture of them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD7zHy80TI/AAAAAAAAADQ/MwptXB34Tsw/s1600-h/birdsall%26RobinBrande042108.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBD7zHy80TI/AAAAAAAAADQ/MwptXB34Tsw/s320/birdsall%26RobinBrande042108.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192927226042831154" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;     Finally, this was a very labor intensive event and I couldn’t have done it without the help of Frank, Antonia, Jeff, Sarah, Angela M., and Cressida.

Our brilliant bookseller, Terry Meagher, hosted the event.  In case you missed it, here's what happened in Terry's words.~&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Nathaniel is one of a cadre of emerging literary novelists hailing from NY; judging from his age (around 30), position as a Senior Editor of&lt;a href="http://www.parisreview.com/"&gt; The Paris Review,&lt;/a&gt; his well-received book of film criticism San Francisco Noir, and quietly confident demeanor (not to mention a slightly unruly mop of black hair), he kind’a fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathaniel began by sharing an anecdote during which he received a tip on how best to conduct an author reading.  A couple years ago at a Paris Review event, the host approached “Nat” wondering if he could help an elderly, wheelchair-bound attendee who had arrived an hour early and appeared somewhat disoriented.  The guest turned out to be &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=the+naked+and+the+dead&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;The Naked and the Dead&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=norman+mailer&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Norman Mailer&lt;/a&gt;, who struck up a conversation with the aspiring author (The Mayor’s Tongue was then a work in progress). “You a drink’n man, son?”  Nat, who sure was now, quickly fetched a pair of gin-and-tonics and chatted with the literary icon for over an hour.  Perhaps flustered by the notorious provocateur, Nat didn’t recall much other than Mr. Mailer’s “sage” advice that if your book has a “sex scene”, by all means, be sure to read it at your event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Nathaniel read an excerpt (funnier though less steamy than what Mr. Mailer probably would have preferred) during which the female protagonist, Sonia, courts lead character Eugene, luring him with two passes to the local mud spa “My Name is Mud”.  The music issuing forth during this romantic interlude is overwhelmed by the cacophony of clanging pipes in the place and the overbearing presence of the stern, pock-marked, staff attendant, Stanka.   Nat freely admitted that the scene was in fact inspired by his own quirky family outing to a similar mud spa.  While the others found the place a near despicable pit – dated, odd, creepy even - Nat, ever the writer, found it strangely fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nat also cited another real-life situation as inspiration for the relationship between Eugene, a young college grad and his fellow Dominican co-worker Alvaro, who speaks a Cibaeno dialect no one comprehends, instead relying strictly on physical gestures and an amazing elasticity of facial expression to communicate.  Years ago, working as an intern in Italy, Nat suddenly found himself desperate for housing.  A fellow worker kindly offered to put up the stranded American at his place.  Though forced to sleep on a fold-out contraption in the cramped, rear kitchen (I’m thinking here of some portable device from that in-flight, Sky Mall catalogue), Nat thought the arrangement a “win-win”:  both roommates could learn the other’s native tongue*.  The Italian, while speaking only a “horrible” Pidgin English, instead insisted on conversing only in English.  The upshot for Nat: his Italian improved not an iota, while his own command of English only worsened.  Though for Nat the whole experience did point up our need as humans to communicate with one another, however desperately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a self-deprecating nod to the less than packed house, Nat began Q&amp;amp;A with a question to himself (“Better that way, you’ll get an answer you’ll know you’ll like!” laughingly piped up an attendee to my immediate left).   He spoke of his current duties at the Paris Review, which include a ton of time wading through the slush pile of short stories; some are “really bad” but, his face brightening, “that rare “gem” of a story does eventually surface”.   He is heavily involved in editing &lt;a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/literature.php"&gt;those famous Paris Review author interviews&lt;/a&gt;.  He especially enjoyed working on an &lt;a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/viewinterview.php/prmMID/5789"&gt;interview with poet August Kleinzahler&lt;/a&gt; and is currently at work editing an interview with Nobel Prize winner &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Search?s=results&amp;amp;initiate=yes&amp;amp;ks=q&amp;amp;qsselect=KQ&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;qstext=orhan+pamuk&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Orhan Pamuk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780375406973"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9780375706851"&gt;My Name is Red&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;To read Terry's post on Russell Banks, &lt;a href="http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008_02_01_archive.html"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/04/mayors-tongue-nathaniel-rich.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SA1SEny80II/AAAAAAAAAB4/3WBSsgG-xQE/s72-c/TheMayor%27sTongue.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5500193978652670263.post-4676865034967591681</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-04-24T17:08:20.989-07:00</atom:updated><title>Nick Taylor - "The Disagreement"</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBEgtHy80WI/AAAAAAAAADo/iZQZsPsQ7Iw/s1600-h/nick_taylor.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBEgtHy80WI/AAAAAAAAADo/iZQZsPsQ7Iw/s320/nick_taylor.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192967804893843810" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:arial;font-size:100%;"  &gt;On April 17th, debut novelist, Nick Taylor, met up at Kepler's with first-time event host, Craig Beebe, and other historical fiction enthusiasts to discuss his Civil War novel, &lt;a href="http://keplers.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&amp;amp;isbn=9781416550655"&gt;The Disagreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't heard of the book, here is a summary (&lt;a href="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=programs-events&amp;amp;subsec=upcoming-events"&gt;ripped from the event page on Kepler's website, which is, by the way, where you should go for a calendar of future Kepler's events!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"THE DISAGREEMENT begins on April 17, 1861, the day that Virginia secedes from the Union and the day that marks the sixteenth birthday of John Alan Muro.  As the Commonwealth erupts in celebration, young Muro sees his dream of attending medical school in Philadelphia shattered by the sudden reality of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muro’s father sends him to Charlottesville instead of Philadelphia, where Jefferson’s forty-year-old University of Virginia has become a haven of rogues and dilettantes. Soon, the war effort requires that medical students like Muro be pressed into service at the Charlottesville General Hospital, where the inexperienced Dr. Muro controversially saves the life of a Northern lieutenant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late in the war, now nineteen and married to his first love, Muro is forced to make a choice that will shape the rest of his life. In this story of unimaginable sacrifice, a doctor struggles to balance the passions of youth with the weight of responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debut novelist Nick Taylor is an &lt;a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/cwmfa/faculty.html#nicktaylor"&gt;English professor at San Jose State University&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a summary of the book, now here's a recap of the evening from Craig. Craig is a new event host, but you probably know him as that friendly tall guy at the register who shouts "Hey! How's it goin?!" to customers entering the store. Take it away, Craig! ~&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;This was a continually surprising evening for me. First, I was surprised and pleased to discover that not only does the author within walking distance of our store, he is a regular customer and a big fan. Then I was surprised to learn that he is not from Virginia, which I had assumed based on his short bio and the fact that his Civil War novel is very engrossingly told from the perspective of a young Virginian medical student. In fact, the only South that Nick Taylor hails from is that of California! Los Angeles, specifically, although he did live in Virginia for 13 years, received a B.A. and M.F.A. at UVA, and met his wife there. But he tells me he is happy to be in California again, and during his very interesting Q&amp;amp;A session, it emerged that he wasn't all that interested in the Civil War until just before he began working on this novel. That makes his achievement in the book all the more admirable, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final great surprise of the evening was the size and enthusiasm of our crowd, which defied my expectations and proved Rich to be rather prescient in his insistence on setting up all of our black chairs. To be truthful, many of the adoring fans were really Nick's friends, family, and colleagues, but still: they were, as I said, enthusiastic both in listening and in asking questions during a very interesting Q&amp;amp;A session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very interested in Nick's comments about writing historical fiction, being a first-time novelist, and discovering your subjects as a writer. His next work will be a telling of the &lt;a href="http://www.sandiegohistory.org/bio/serra/serra.htm"&gt;Junipero Serra&lt;/a&gt; story, and I will definitely look forward to reading it. ~ Craig&lt;/span&gt;</description><link>http://keplers.blogspot.com/2008/04/nick-taylor-disagreement.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Kepler's)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_TmtvKFZlpzU/SBEgtHy80WI/AAAAAAAAADo/iZQZsPsQ7Iw/s72-c/nick_taylor.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
