Remember the dip in the graph? Well the generous Microsoft Imagine Cup organizers have filled it up with an extra $10,000 bringing the first-place prize money back to $25,000. Can&#8217;t complain about that and I&#8217;m sincerely grateful for their extra generosity which I must stress was not in any bit compelled.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you think you&#8217;ve seen what&#8217;s possible with <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">Photosynth</a>, then you&#8217;ve seen nothing yet. The collaborative research team from the University of Washington and Microsoft Research who only two years ago in 2006 published their paper &#8220;<a href="http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/">Photo Tourism</a>&#8221; and their technology demonstration &#8220;Photosynth&#8221; have again pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved by intuitively processing the abundance of digital images shared on the web.</p>
<p>This week at <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/">SIGGRAPH 2008</a> they&#8217;re sharing with the world some even better technology they&#8217;ve been working on which they call &#8220;<a href="http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/findingpaths/">Finding Paths through the World&#8217;s Photos</a>&#8220;. Don&#8217;t let the name fool you, it&#8217;s damn cool. If you&#8217;re not much of a reading person like me, take a look at this video demonstration. (Watch it till the end)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><object width="550" height="445"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gLLzV5qeKyk&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gLLzV5qeKyk&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="550" height="445"></embed></object></div>
<p>This technology is much better than Photosynth simply because instead of just presenting individual photographs in a cool 3D environment, it actually manipulates the photo to give you a seamless and more lifelike experience. It&#8217;s one thing to click around different photos taken at a particular museum, it&#8217;s a whole other story to &#8220;walk through&#8221; the museum.</p>
<p>Now if you want to know exactly how they did it, and you&#8217;re a rocket scientist, take a look at their <a href="http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/findingpaths/paper/FindingPaths_siggraph08.pdf">conference paper</a>. For the rest of us, just take it for granted.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s probably safe to bet that all of Microsoft&#8217;s online operations doesn&#8217;t run off a single server in the basement of Gates&#8217; house (on the other hand <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/08/11/two-weeks-after-apple-calls-mobileme-stable-mail-goes-down">Apple&#8217;s MobileMe might actually be running</a> in Jobs&#8217; basement), so how many servers do Microsoft actually have? Microsoft never says and no one seems to know for sure except the few numbers thrown around including a notable &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1391">10,000 new servers a month</a>&#8220;, however, a recent promotional video produced by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/environment/">Microsoft&#8217;s Environmental Sustainability</a> group may have accidentally spilled the beans.</p>
<p>The following screencaps are from taken from the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/b/7/9b7e6a89-c3b1-4bc6-af27-3fba8e5cbed8/Rob_Bernard_Q_A_mid_res_V6.wmv">video Q&#038;A with Rob Bernard</a>, Chief Environmental Strategist, at 2min 29sec to 2min 35sec for those of you playing at home.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/server1.jpg" alt="" title="server1" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/server2.jpg" alt="" title="server1" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/server3.jpg" alt="" title="server1" /></div>
<p>Some quick stats gathered from the above clippings: 15 datacenters hosting 148,357 servers sitting on 17,406 racks consuming 72,500KW of utility power as of the end of January 2008 (as indicated by the bar chart). If you&#8217;re a bit of a imperial measurement person, that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=72%2C500KW+in+horsepower">97,000 horsepower</a>. So the next time you visit Live Search, think of the horses.</p>
<p>On the same page there&#8217;s also an interesting graph showing the distribution of servers per &#8220;property&#8221;. Live Search is in the clear lead with approximately 75,000 (50%) of the servers pushing out those less-than-desirable search results, followed by Hotmail. The other notable property occupying a large chunk of the servers would be &#8220;other&#8221; (appropriately named), which one could assume be dedicated to XBOX Live services and the like.</p>
<p>Assuming these statistics are real and accurate, then at the growth rate of 10,000 servers a month Microsoft should be at 218,000 servers at the end of August 08. A mind-blowing number. They&#8217;re going to need more horses.</p>

<p>One of the first requests I received after <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080611/state-of-the-taskforce/">launching the Windows UX Taskforce</a> was &#8220;when can you make one for Mac OS X&#8221;. This came at a surprise to me because I didn&#8217;t know OS X had user experience flaws, but <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2007/10/27/mac-os-x-leopard-ui-inconsistencies/">apparently it did</a> and still do. Having said that today I&#8217;m proud to launch <a href="http://www.aquataskforce.com/">Aqua Taskforce</a>, a taskforce site for Apple users to submit, vote and comment on OS X user experience quirks.</p>
<p>Windows UX Taskforce has also been renamed to <a href="http://www.aerotaskforce.com/">Aero Taskforce</a> for consistency. One login will work on both sites.</p>
<p>On the front-end you&#8217;ll probably notice that the site is visually different with a distinct Apple styling - which looks amazing I should add. Special credits to my friend Oscar for the hard work and more ahead of him. Don&#8217;t worry Windows users, Aero Taskforce is next in line to receive a visual makeover.</p>
<p>However what I&#8217;m more proud of is the changes on the back-end which some might have noticed via the different URLs. The new back-end has been re-engineered to support multiple (taskforce) sites with one codebase and a shared login system. Now I can deploy multiple Taskforces in just a matter of minutes. If you run a business and are interested in setting up a hosted but customized taskforce site for your products or services, please contact me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/windows7personal.jpg" alt="" title="windows7personal" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" />Don&#8217;t worry Windows 95 Plus! enthusiasts, Microsoft hasn&#8217;t forgotten about you and your themes. A recently updated MSDN Library document shows that Microsoft hasn&#8217;t just brushed themes under the carpet, but instead dusted it off, added some new polish and is even putting it under the spotlight.</p>
<p>The document &#8220;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773190.aspx">Creating and Installing Theme Files</a>&#8221; (now edited) has been updated with several &#8220;additions to the .theme file format were made for Windows 7&#8243;. They include:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Themes</strong><br />
The [Theme] section of the file contains the following two attributes:</p>
<p><em><code>Icon=module,-iconId (example: themeui.dll,-123) or pathToIcon (example: MyTheme.ico)</code></em><br />
Windows 7 and later. The icon to show in the <span style="background:#ffffcc;">theme gallery</span>, either an embedded resource or a path to an .ico file. Paths are relative to the directory of the .theme file.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Desktop Appearance</strong><br />
You can create custom wallpaper for the desktop and specify a path to the graphics file. Additionally, this section of the .theme file can specify whether the screen saver is active. The following example shows how to do modify the desktop appearance. Windows 7 and later: If the slideshow is active, the path can be a path to a folder containing multiple images, or a colon-delimited list of image files.</p>
<p>Windows 7 and later. The following attribute is set to &#8220;1&#8243; to <span style="background:#ffffcc;">enable a slide show as the wallpaper</span>.<br />
<em><code>Slideshow=1</code></em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Theme Packs</strong><br />
Windows 7 and later. <span style="background:#ffffcc;">A theme pack is a .cab file that contains not only the .theme file but also the files needed to implement the theme on another computer, such as sound files and images.</span> Users can create theme packs through the Personalization application in Control Panel.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sudden rejuvenation in themes excites me and puzzles me at the same time. On one hand, I have a lot of fond memories with themes in Windows 95 Plus! - the sound effects would always be so bizarre. On the other, OS GUI customization is becoming much less common - much less so in Vista than compared to XP.</p>
<p>Personally, the idea of using a third party visual style in Vista has never even crossed the mind and I&#8217;m someone who wouldn&#8217;t think twice about using a custom style in XP. Does anyone else still use custom styles or even custom themes (cursors, sound effects)?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The Windows 7 information has now been removed. <em>Oh come on Sinofsky, give me a break.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone by now has probably heard of or looked at the <a href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/">Mojave experiment</a>, a grassroots marketing campaign by Microsoft to combat the negative image around Windows Vista. Some like it, <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/07/mojave-experiment-bad-science-bad.html">some people think it&#8217;s flawed</a>, but whatever you think of it you have to admit it&#8217;s a pretty smart idea. &#8220;But why is it faster&#8221; is great advertising no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.bamideas.com/">Bradley and Montgomery</a> comes in. B&#038;M is the advertising agency behind Mojave but this is not the first time they&#8217;ve worked with Microsoft. Here&#8217;s a few other nuggets from their <a href="http://www.bamideas.com/ideas/clients/microsoft/">portfolio</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/postit_large.jpg"><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/postit.jpg" alt="" title="postit_large" /></a></p>
<p>An interactive print ad to demo the &#8220;previous versions&#8221; restore functionality in Windows Vista.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/suntan.jpg" alt="" title="suntan" /></p>
<p>A witty and functional print ad for Windows Small Business Server.</p>

<p>Video segments from a series of &#8220;not-so-serious&#8221; ads for Office Live.</p>
<p>I definitely like how these guys think.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2698103825/" title="DSC_0161 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2698103825_a7f6599645.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0161" /></a></div>
<p>Who would have guessed, a rookie team from Australia whose representatives in the past has never gone as far as the world semi-finals with a blow-up Kangaroo as a mentor would actually come out <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/jul08/07-08ICWINNERSPR.mspx">first-place champions</a> in the <a href="http://imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup world finals</a>. The awesome part of this story is that I&#8217;m actually on that team. w00t.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/soak.jpg" alt="" title="soak" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" />Naturally when you win something like this, the question you always get is &#8220;how did you do it&#8221; followed by &#8220;no way, seriously, how did you do it&#8221; and &#8220;when you are rich don&#8217;t forget about me&#8221;. Now that this web server is alive and kicking, without any further ado, here is how my team and I conquered <strike>planet Earth</strike> Imagine Cup 2008.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, all of this was very close to have not happened at all because of my reluctance to join the competition in the first place. When my teammates asked me to join them back in February I actually declined twice because I thought I was already overloaded and couldn&#8217;t contribute much. I guess playing &#8220;hard to get&#8221; turned out pretty well after all. My teammates would probably have a different opinion on this.</p>
<p>Choosing the topic was almost trivial, the biggest environmental problem in Australia is the lack of water resources. Most people at this stage would probably start to think about households because that&#8217;s probably what all the advertisements are saying, &#8220;turn off your tap and save the world&#8221;. Granted saving water at home is important but there&#8217;s no comparison to how much water the agriculture industry uses. Sure, drinking water is not their primary source but the environment is a closed loop and any water resource is precious.</p>
<p><span id="more-3017"></span></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2373340908/" title="Grape vines by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2373340908_df890235a5.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Grape vines" /></a></div>
<p>The next problem we faced was that none of us are farmers. My farming experience went as far as &#8220;plant the seeds, water it and wait&#8221;. That didn&#8217;t help us very much. Our solution to this problem, and I think the one of the most successful steps in our journey to win was to speak to farmers. We went out to a farm in the country who a team member&#8217;s parents were familiar with the owners, talked to the owner and the farm operators to learn first-hand about farming and the problems they are facing.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/burgerking.jpg" alt="" title="burgerking" style="float:right;margin-left:15px;"/>What happened next could probably be noted as the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; to our success. After a day of walking, talking, more walking and running from the rain on the farm, we drove to a nearby Hungry Jacks (a.k.a. Burger King internationally) store to plan what would essentially become our &#8220;SOAK&#8221; solution over a couple of burgers, fries and Coke with unlimited refills. I remember very clearly only refilling once, wasn&#8217;t very thirsty.</p>
<p>In the several weeks and months following, there were a couple late nights, a few sessions of <a href="http://www.ea.com/boomblox/">Boom Blox</a> on the Wii and even more sessions of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/b/bombermanlivexboxlivearcade/">Bomberman Live</a>. Team-building exercises is probably the right word.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2638155865/" title="DSC_0041 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3190/2638155865_2ea8795371.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0041" /></a></div>
<p>Now fast forward to Paris, I begin to comprehend just what we&#8217;re up against. We meet two guys from the United States on the shuttle bus to find not they were not the actual competitors but &#8220;fans&#8221; of the competitors to cheer them on. All we had was a blow-up Kangaroo and a fluffy Koala. The Imagine Cup was a lot bigger than I imagined (pun).</p>
<p>The seven days that followed was a lot of fun, excitement, disappointment, confusion, tiredness, thinking, preparing, digesting, walking and talking. </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2636799353/" title="DSC_0135 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3026/2636799353_ebba79e78c.jpg" width="500" height="299" alt="DSC_0135" /></a></div>
<p>The food was popular to say the least.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2638988734/" title="DSC_0080 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2638988734_de85505317.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0080" /></a></div>
<p>We present. </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2639397613/" title="Semi-finalist announcement by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2639397613_773f41cd1e.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Semi-finalist announcement" /></a></div>
<p>We are in the the semi-finals. We present more. We are in the finals. </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2639400683/" title="Interviewed by Channel8/10 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3016/2639400683_98c233583f.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Interviewed by Channel8/10" /></a></div>
<p>The rush otherwise known as interviews begin.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2647472502/" title="DSC_0023 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2647472502_163ae78e54.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0023" /></a></div>
<p>And we go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre</a> (yes home to the Mona Lisa) to rehearse.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2646657143/" title="DSC_0047 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/2646657143_2c0617e5c2.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0047" /></a></div>
<p>Followed by another quick interview.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2647700222/" title="DSC_0217 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3241/2647700222_2efb879565.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0217" /></a></div>
<p>Sometime in the afternoon prior I must have said out aloud &#8220;gee, I don&#8217;t feel stressed out at all with the finals, I wish I could find something else to do to keep me busy&#8221;. I say this because Microsoft then informed me a group of students were going to talk on a panel at an <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27043&#038;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&#038;URL_SECTION=201.html">United Nations event</a> in the morning of the day of the finals. I was part of that group. I don&#8217;t regret speaking at that event (you don&#8217;t get to talk to hundreds of the education leaders of different nations very often) but I just wish it was better scheduled.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2647784110/" title="DSC_0026 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3260/2647784110_4f52daebe4.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0026" /></a></div>
<p>Finally, we went to the Louvre and we presented one last time. </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2647780960/" title="DSC_0008 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/2647780960_fd80e2f018.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0008" /></a></div>
<p>By then our mentor was feeling a little &#8220;flat-out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then we had to wait almost 24 hours for the results. (Speaking of which, I&#8217;m not exactly sure what I did that night - I don&#8217;t remember or have any photos.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2653234377/" title="DSC_0030 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3006/2653234377_359e6ab684.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0030" /></a></div>
<p>Next, announcement day. Everyone was at the Louvre this time - students, press and delegates from the UN education forum.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2653235141/" title="DSC_0057 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3211/2653235141_d6f01abd55.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0057" /></a></div>
<p>We must had given just under 50 interviews and demos because I don&#8217;t ever remember talking to David (who was doing most of the demos).</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2654058644/" title="DSC_0049 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2654058644_bdc3995dda.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0049" /></a></div>
<p>Our mentor helped too.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2653244127/" title="DSC_0184 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3265/2653244127_3f08c3ce13.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0184" /></a></div>
<p>Then the announcements. History speaks for itself.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2653245813/" title="DSC_0215 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/2653245813_6fb916fa45.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0215" /></a></div>
<p>Followed by more interviews from left, right and center.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2654070664/" title="DSC_0234 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2654070664_76b08e805f.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0234" /></a></div>
<p>And I kissed our mentor (who was actually quite modest).</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2653252995/" title="DSC_0368 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/2653252995_e3c7016183.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0368" /></a></div>
<p>Then we partied.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2653251887/" title="DSC_0309 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/2653251887_001bebec51.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0309" /></a></div>
<p>When we realized there was no food bigger than my right pinky, a few of us went out to a restaurant where Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/People/Max/">Max Zuckerman</a> showed off his cool party trick. It fell over more often than not, but you wouldn&#8217;t know that because that&#8217;s the magic of photography.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/2654079988/" title="DSC_0042 by Long Zheng, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2654079988_5bab0b436e.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="DSC_0042" /></a></div>
<p>On the following day, we went to where all champions go to celebrate after their big win. <a href="http://www.disneylandparis.com/">Disneyland Paris</a>. Here, I discovered my soft spot for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22it%27s_a_small_world%22">&#8220;It&#8217;s a small world&#8221;</a> - a more approachable ride for people with motion sickness like me.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here&#8217;s a couple screenshots from our Silverlight web application software with the final user interface which I&#8217;m very proud of to have designed and helped develop.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/soak1.jpg" alt="" title="soak1" /><br />
<img src="http://www.istartedsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/soak2.jpg" alt="" title="soak1" /></div>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Thanks to my teammates - David, Dimaz and Edward. Special thanks to Microsoft Australia&#8217;s Roger and Karo for taking care of us abroad. Special mention to our Commonwealth buddies - Microsoft Canada&#8217;s Jean-Luc David and the Canadian team for the many enjoyable dinners. Finally, thanks to Joe Wilson, Emanuele (Millo) Ognissanti, Max Zuckerman, Nic Fillingham and all the Imagine Cup hosts and crew for hosting such a spectacular event.</p>

<p>Oooh, so that&#8217;s what the big shiny red button do.</p>
<p>Frequent visitors of this website may have wittingly discovered the somewhat lack of website over the past few weeks. Firstly, I would like to apologize if you were in any way traumatized by the outage.</p>
<p>I was planning to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/more_amazon_s3_downtime.php">blame Amazon S3</a> for the downtime but that might be a little unfair because I actually don&#8217;t use their service. Blaming other people is always fun.</p>
<p>The slightly more boring truth is that a server software update corrupted the kernel (yes the server runs Linux) whilst I was in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longzheng/sets/72157606126984286/">Denmark</a> on holiday celebrating my team&#8217;s <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Australian-students-win-global-software-competition/0,130061733,339290445,00.htm?omnRef=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/about/news/archive/2008/news-imagine-winner-global.html">first-prize win in Microsoft&#8217;s Imagine Cup world finals</a> in Paris (more about that later). Needless to say the fun I was having outweighed my desire to fix the server. Some of you may have even witnessed the fun I had discovering my inner-Pirate from a placeholder photo in the past couple of days (credit to my Denmark host and server operator for the captions).</p>
<p>Now everything is back to normal, sort of.</p>
