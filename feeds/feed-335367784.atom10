<p>As a new Windows Vista PC/notebook user you will need to be prepared to deal with the amount of memory Windows Vista uses up. It is critical for you to know how to keep your PC in good shape and optimize your computer so it can run fast. I will share some tips in this article which I&#8217;ve been using on my Vista computer.<br />
I hope this article is useful for someone new to the Windows Vista operating system.</p>
<p>1. First you need to get rid of all the Startup items that you don&#8217;t need. Windows Vista automatically starts<br />
programs that you&#8217;ve chosen to start up when you start your computer. This slows down the amount of time it takes for your computer to start. I have nothing besides TaskScheduler and Windows Defender in my startup. I&#8217;ve removed all the other startup items and my computer started up noticeable faster. </p>
<p>In order to remove unnecessary startup programs, you will have to launch the System Configuration utility. Go to the Start menu by clicking on the Vista orb in the taskbar, then type in &#8220;msconfig&#8221; in the Search box. This will launch the System Configuration utility. Click on the tab which says &#8220;Startup&#8221;. Take a look at all the Startup items listed and uncheck the items that you don&#8217;t need. Once you&#8217;ve unchecked al the unnecessary startup items, just click on &#8220;Apply&#8221; and &#8220;Ok&#8221; to confirm your changes. Restart your computer for the changes<br />
to take affect.</p>
<p>2. It is important to keep your desktop organized. Having a large amount of icons and programs on your desktop can make your computer load slow. Try to make folders and label each folder appropriately. Group all your documents and software and place them in the proper folders.</p>
<p>3. Use the Disk Cleanup utility to free up extra space on your computer. You can find this utility in the Accessories/System Tools menu. This utility will scan your computer and find temporary files and other unneccessary files that are taking up space on your computer. Select the files that you don&#8217;t need and click on &#8220;Okay&#8221; to delete these files. You can free up more space by clicking on the &#8220;More Options&#8221; tab and uninstalling all the programs that you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>4. Use the Disk Defragmenter tool in Accessories/System Tools menu to defragment your computer. Usually this is automatically done by default but just in case it&#8217;s not you can launch the Disk Defragmenter tool to defragment your hard disk manually.</p>
<p>5. Use Windows Update to keep your software up to date. Windows Update is automatically enabled on your Windows Vista OS but you have to manually select the updates you want to install.</p>
<p>You should always check for updates and install the recommended updates to keep your computer secure and stable.</p>
<p>6. If you don&#8217;t use the Windows Sidebar then close it. Closing the sidebar will save up some memory and allow you to use that memory for other processes.</p>
<p>7. Be prepared for viruses if you download a lot. Download firewall software like McAffee to protect your computer from viruses and other threats. Make sure you<br />
scan files that you download from untrusted websites before you open them.</p>
<p>8. Windows Vista has a Readyboost feature that allows you to use the memory on certain USB flash drives to speed up your computer. If you have a USB flash drive you can enable Windows Vista</p>
<p>Readyboost on it and use it&#8217;s memory to speed up your computer. After testing this with a 1GB Sandisk Cruzer, Windows Vista Readyboost made my computer run noticeabley faster.</p>
<p>9. Set your Windows Vista password to a secure password. If someone stole your PC or notebook they could find readily available software to hack in to your computer. Make sure you use a good password<br />
to protect your account. Using an eight character password with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters will make your account very secure.</p>
<p>10. If you&#8217;re a notebook user and you use WiFi, turn off the WiFi whenever you&#8217;re not using your notebook. This will save you battery time and allow you to use your notebook for a longer period without having to recharge your notebook. Adjusting the brightness on your screen, and muting the volume also helps with saving power. You can also go to Control Panel and click Power Options. Choosing the &#8220;Power Saver&#8221; plan will really save you a lot of energy.</p>
<p>There is a lot more that can and should be done with Windows Vista, but I just wanted to compile a top 10 list and post it up here. If any Windows Vista user here has any more tips please feel free to share them with the rest of the community.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Today I upgraded my Mini 1000's memory from 1GB to 2GB in less than 20 seconds and I didn't even need to use a screw driver. Upgrading RAM on a notebook is usually a pretty simple task for experienced computer users, but I don't see how HP could've made this any easier on the Mini 1000. Check out this video to see what I mean.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I upgraded my Mini 1000&#8217;s memory from 1GB to 2GB in less than 20 seconds and I didn&#8217;t even need to use a screw driver. Upgrading RAM on a notebook is usually a pretty simple task for experienced computer users, but I don&#8217;t see how HP could&#8217;ve made this any easier on the Mini 1000. Check out this video to see what I mean.</p>
<p>[There is a video that cannot be displayed in this feed. <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2008/12/12/hp-mini-1000-how-to-upgrade-ram-in-less-than-20-seconds-video/">Visit the blog entry to see the video.]</a></p>
<p>No tools are necessary as there are no screws holdnig the Mini 1000&#8217;s memory door shut. Instead there&#8217;s a little latch next to the one of the battery releases. All you need is a pointy object like a pen or a knife to reach a hole in the latch so you can slide it to the side. The battery door pops off and gives you easy access to the single memory slot.</p>
<p>You can get a 2GB memory stick from NewEgg, Amazon.com or most other online retailers for under $25. HP does not sell the Mini 1000 with 2GB of memory if you order the XP version because of a licensing agreement with Microsoft. When the MIE (Ubuntu) Mini 1000 is released in January you will be able to customize it with 2GB of RAM on HP&#8217;s Web site.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever used your laptop as a portable media player or hooked it up to a projector for a presentation at the office? If you have, chances are you also strained your ears to listen to the weak sound trickling out from the underpowered speakers. Want an affordable and portable solution? Then try the B-Flex 2 USB speakers from Jlabs.</p>
<p>The B-Flex 2 is a great addition to your laptop kit. Weighing in at 4 ounces and featuring a flexible gooseneck design, it&#8217;s incredibly easy to fit into your laptop bag and hit the road. The sound from the B-Flex 2 far outweighs the less than ideal output from your average laptop speakers. With a frequency range of 200 - 20,000 Hz the speakers don&#8217;t pack any real bass, but the rest of the sound comes out loud and clear. It plugs directly into any available USB port and without any drivers its powered and ready to go. </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2455 alignnone" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/51uxcdkb2xl_ss400_.jpg" alt="51uxcdkb2xl_ss400_" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those who are particular about their stereo sound experience will be somewhat disappointed with the B-Flex 2. Since most laptops feature their USB ports on the sides of the unit the B-Flex is forced to be plugged in to one side of your laptop or the other. Although your still getting stereo sound, it will be coming from one side of your laptop. The other unfortunate part about being USB powered is that it means your laptop is powering the speakers from its own battery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, at $30 the B-Flex is a drop in the bucket for a flexible alternative to your onboard speakers. I would add this to the list of great gift buys for the laptop owner in your family.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB powered</li>
<li>Flexible gooseneck</li>
<li>Compact design</li>
<li>Louder &amp; overall better sound than your onboard speakers</li>
<li>Comes in an array of colors</li>
<li>$30 price tag</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drains your battery quicker since its USB powered</li>
<li>Sound is limited to the side you plug the device into</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m enjoying my new unibody MacBook Pro, but not having a docking solution is a real pain. Things are really crowded since all of the ports are on the left side of the new MacBook Pro and while this notebook is uber stylish on its own, things can get ugly once you plug in your peripherals.</p>
<p>I was just using my MacBook  Pro to edit some video and wanted to bring it to my living room to finish up. I decided not to move it because I didn&#8217;t want to deal with unplugging everyting and then plugging it all back in again.</p>
<p>I currently have a Seagate Free Agent Go connected via the FireWire 800 port. My iPhone 3G, Jawbone 2 headset and an SD card reader are plugged in via a mini USB hub.  My display is connected to my MacBook Pro&#8217;s via a mini displayport/DVI adapter. My speakers are plugged into the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Life would be just a litle easier if Apple would make a sensible docking solution for its power users.</p>

RosettaStone’s software would make a great gift for anyone who wants to learn a language, but doesn’t want to sit through tortuous lectures. RosettaStone has it’s flaws, but I prefer it to learning languages in a classroom.</p>
<p>The lessons are very similar pattern to what you’d expect out of a textbook, but they are fully interactive and the software is fun to use. Each language has three levels that can be purchased separately or as a bundle. The Level 1 package is broken down into four units covering the basics of the language, greetings, work &amp; school and shopping.</p>
<p>Single levels of each language are available on CD-ROM for $259 or you can buy all three levels of a language for $549. There is a web-based version available that costs $199 for a six-month subscription. There is a Mac and PC version of the software included on each CD.</p>
<p>I used Spanish Level 1 for a couple of weeks and really enjoyed the experience compared to my high school and college language classes.  I took French for two years in high school and never did perfect my pronunciation of common phrases.</p>
<p>In college I switched to Spanish because I thought it’d be much more useful since I live in California. Spanish 101 went ok, but Spanish 102 was a different story. I got so frustrated with Spanish 102 that I dropped out of that class….twice. The third time was the charm and I passed with a C before finally nailing Spanish 103 on the first try with another C.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2442 aligncenter" title="rosettastone_review_grammar_spanish" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rosettastone_review_grammar_spanish-500x362.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="362" /></p>
<p>The two times I did manage to learn and use languages well enough to get around was when I studied abroad in Thailand and spent a summer in Germany.  I was by no means fluent in German or Thai, but I could grunt my way through a conversation and understand just enough to get the gist of natives’ conversations.  My primary challenge with learning languages is that it’s tough for me to pronounce foreign words.</p>
<p>RosettaStone is like having a language lab and a tutor in your notebook. comes with a USB headset with a microphone and a great pronunciation tool. When my pronunciation needed improvement RosettaStone showed me exactly what I was doing wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rosettastone_review_grammar_spanish_pronunciation.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2441 aligncenter" title="rosettastone_review_grammar_spanish_pronunciation" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rosettastone_review_grammar_spanish_pronunciation-499x410.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously I’m not the fastest language learner and one thing I really like about RosettaStone’s system is that it allows me to go at my own pace. There were no teachers getting frustrated when I don’t get something right.  RosettaStone allows you to adjust how perfect your pronunciation needs to be to pass a section. I like this because it let me zip through a lesson the fist time with so-so pronunciation, but fine tune my pronunciation on a second pass.</p>
<p>Completing Level 1 can take a looooonnnggg time.  While I definitely prefer RossettaStone to my lecture/lab experience from school, it is still geared for people who are looking to use Level 1 as a building block towards becoming fluent rather than getting a crash course before travelling overseas. This is a positive for students, but a negative for people like myself who travel overseas on a regular basis.  Level 1 covers phrases like “She has a dog” and “the new house is red” instead of phrases that are much more likely to be useful in real-world situations.</p>
<p>RosettaStone used to offer a travelers’ version of their software and I think it’s something they should bring back so users can quickly learn phrases like:<br />
“Where is the nearest ATM”<br />
“Where is the bathroom?”<br />
“Do you speak English?”<br />
“Can you please take my photo?”</p>
<p>RosettaStone should also include more relevant photos in its lessons. Spanish Level 1 had photos of an Indian snake charmer and a fruit stand in Italy.  This doesn’t distract from the learning process too much, but it would be nice if everything matched up a bit better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2443 aligncenter" title="rosettastone_review_adios_spanish_indian" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rosettastone_review_adios_spanish_indian-500x373.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong><br />
If you’re willing to put in the hours you can definitely use RosettaStone to teach yourself a foreign language and nail pronunciations. The software isn’t perfect and it’s not the right choice for people who want a quick dose of lessons before traveling for just a short trip. RosettaStone is much more enjoyable than using text books and listening to a teacher berate you as you butcher a language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">A lot of netbooks look and feel like toys, but HP’s blessed the Mini 1000 with design cues borrowed from its Pavilion notebooks, making it the best looking netbook to date. This Mini 1000 is an excellent choice for anyone that understands the limitations of a netbook, likes the idea of simplicity and favors style over having a couple of extra ports and plugs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My favorite feature on the Mini 1000 is its generously sized keyboard, which makes it usable for those of us with large hands. I think the HP Mini is going to become one of the hottest-selling netbooks in the coming months as HP is distributing it through its extensive retail network and once people get their hands on it they don&#8217;t want to put it down.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2393 aligncenter" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-4" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-4-500x137.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="137" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000 does everything a netbook’s supposed to do, but there are compromises. The Mini 1000 is a consumer netbook, which means it’s geared towards casual users, not business users who generally need more durable devices. Its plastic shell looks great, but is a fingerprint magnet and isn&#8217;t nearly as sturdy as the aluminum finish found on the business-oriented HP Mini Note 2133. I recommend business users avoid the netbook market entirely until more robust systems are introduced in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I first saw the Mini 1000 before it was released and posted the several videos. Since then I’ve had the chance to spend some more time with the HP Mini 1035nr, a pre-configured version that includes the optional 10.2-inch display, Bluetooth, 1GB of RAM, a 60GB hard drive and Windows XP. This configuration currently costs $464.99, while the base model starts at $369.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are plenty of good netbooks out there, but the average consumer knows and (mostly) trusts the HP brand more than ASUS, Acer and MSI.  Millions of EeePC and Acer One netbooks have been sold already, but I predict the Mini 1000 is going to dramitaclly increase the popularity of the netbook segment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">HP has the most shelf space of any PC manufacturer at key retail locations such as Best Buy.  This is a huge advantage and something that can’t be underestimated by HP’s competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once people touch the Mini 1000 they want one. Women I’ve talked to LOVE the Mini 1000. I was introduced to a lady at a dinner party last night and when I told her that I wrote for Notebooks.com she immediately told me she was interested in buying the super-cute HP notebook she saw at Costco. My mother wants one to write with and my wife is waiting for the Mini 1000 Vivienne Tam edition  to come down in price before getting one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, buying a netbook is a very personal decision and you may or may not agree with my findings, but I can assure you that the Mini 1000 has some &#8220;it&#8221; factor that will make most consumers forget about some of its shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For it’s smart design, mass appeal, Mobile Internet Experience and best-in-class keyboard, the HP Mini 1000 earns Notebooks.com <strong>Editor’s Choice Award</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #888888;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Appearance:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/vt-laptop-model-clutch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2428" title="vt-laptop-model-clutch" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/vt-laptop-model-clutch.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000 has a plastic shell with the HP Swirl design imprinted in the lid. The same technique and material are used on the Mini 1000 as the rest of the Pavilion line.<br />
There is a red special edition Mini 1000 that’s aimed directly at the fashionistas and has been carried down runways by models that weigh just a few ounces more than the netbook ;-) Some people call the Mini 1000 a “digital clutch” because of its fashion appeal and after spending any amount of time with it you’ll understand why.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2394" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-5" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-5-500x331.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" /></a><br />
The HP Mini 1000 I reviewed is the standard black version, which has the same external appearance as the Pavilion consumer notebook line. Several other manufacturers’ netbooks are like the redheaded stepchildren of their notebook families and don’t look like their bigger brethren at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-6-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2395" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-6-1" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-6-1-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a>The Mini 1000 ‘s “Infinity Display” has no bezel, giving it a nice premium look. There is a small HP logo on the lid of the notebook, another just below the screen and a small “HP Mini” monogram on the right side of the display. The markings are minimal and tasteful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2396" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-7" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-7-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a>Here&#8217;s a photo of the Mini 1000 compared to the HP Pavilion dv4. As you can see, the Mini 1000 has a similar appearance and obviously belongs to the same family.<br />
<strong> HP Mini 1000 Performance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The HP Mini 1000 I reviewed has pretty typical specifications as far as current netbooks go: 1.6GHz Intel Atom Processor, Intel GMA 950 and 1GB of RAM and Windows XP. As you can imagine, it performs very similarly. It’s relatively snappy when it comes to web browsing and writing/reading email, but sluggish when it comes to processor and graphics intensive tasks. I imported several dozen recent pictures from my Canon Powershot and edited them using Google Picasa. The Mini 1000 was up to the task and I could perform basic edits on my jpg photos.<br />
But when I installed Photoshop Elements 7 the Mini 1000 had met its match. I could some simple tasks I waited for the hourglass way too often and the application crashed repeatedly. Netbooks really aren’t meant from graphics applications and this is an example of when a full-sized notebook is a better choice than a netbook.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Graphics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I could watch high quality YouTube videos full screen. The best video quality was achieved with my SlingBox since the Slingbox player automatically adjusts video quality so it doesn’t stutter. The HP Mini 1000 comes with Intel’s Graphics Media Accelerator 950. This is a very basic graphics solution and at times it struggles with the most basic video playback, but this is par for the course with current generation netbooks. Don’t expect to play video games or high bit-rate video on the Mini or similarly configured netbooks. Watching Hulu.com HD video was like watching a stop-action animation.<br />
<strong>Keyboard and Touch Pad:</strong><br />
Typing on the Mini is not as comfortable as typing on a Pavilion notebook, but it’s luxurious compared to the S10 and other netbooks I’ve used. I have large hands so this is especially important to me. Children and those with petite hands may not appreciate this aspect of the Mini 1000 as much as I do.<br />
The HP Mini 1000 has the best keyboard of any netbook I’ve used. Its keys are 92% of the size of a standard notebook keyboard, which is is significantly larger than those found on the Lenovo IdeaPad S10 or the EeePC series.  Nothing compares to a full sized keyboard, but after getting adjusted to the keyboard I could easily touch-type at nearly full speed without thinking twice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_keyboard-21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2431" title="mini_1000_keyboard-21" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_keyboard-21-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ve learned to touch-type on the S10 (picture below), but it’s not nearly as comfortable and I accidentally hit the wrong buttons too frequently. As you can see the HP Mini 1000&#8217;s keys are much larger than the S10&#8217;s.<br />
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_keyboard-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2433 aligncenter" title="mini_1000_keyboard-11" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_keyboard-11-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a> The only quirk that continues to bug me on the Mini 1000&#8217;s keyboard is that the “1” key is smaller than the rest of the number keys. I sometimes hit the “~” key when typing.<br />
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2403" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-10" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-10-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a> While most netbooks have the click buttons beneath the touchpad, the HP Mini 1000’s buttons are to the left and right of the touch pad. This unusual button layout is borrowed from the Mini 2133’s design and while I learned to adapt to the layout after a couple of days, some people hate this layout with a passion. I wouldn’t let the touch pad issue layout hold you back from getting the Mini 1000. You can minimize the use of the buttons by tapping on the touch pad to click and there’s a scroll zone on its right side.<br />
There’s a button above the touch pad that disables it and the left/right click buttons so you don’t have to worry about accidentally hitting them, but I wish HP would kill this button in favor of a bigger touch pad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> HP Mini 1000 Dimensions and Portability<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Portability is one of the primary reasons why  you should consider adding a netbook to your digital lifestyle and the Mini 1000 is small enough to bring wherever you go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000 weighs 2.38 pounds and measures  10.3 inches wide, 6.56 inches deep and  .99 inch tall. It&#8217;s easy to carry around, stow in your book bag, shove in most purses or hide in your glove compartment.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video of the Vivienne Tam edition Mini 1000 slipping into a purse.<br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="309" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://blip.tv/play/_U_W7T0A" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="309" src="http://blip.tv/play/_U_W7T0A"></embed></object></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also found the Mini 1000 to be useful on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_glove_compartment.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2427" title="mini_1000_glove_compartment" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_glove_compartment-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_glove_compartment-1.jpg"><br />
</a><br />
Having a WWAN connection and a netbook in your glove compartment provides is really convenient. My car&#8217;s glove compartment is tiny, but just big enough for the Mini 1000, my 30GB iPod and Compass 597 wireless modem to coexist. My car has both an iPod integration kit and an auxiliary audio input, which means I can plug the Mini 1000&#8217;s headphone jack into my car&#8217;s audio system to listen to music and movies (while not driving of course).  I used this setup to access <a href="http://wwww.Pandora.com">Pandora</a> to have a nearly limitless audio library on the go and watch live TV via my Slingbox.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_glove_compartment-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2425" title="mini_1000_glove_compartment-1" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_glove_compartment-1-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">HP Mini 1000 Storage Capacity</span></strong></p>
<p>HP had to use the smaller drive so it could make the Mini 1000 thinner than many other netbooks on the market. Some notebooks, such as the Mini note 2133 and the IdeaPad S10 have full sized 2.5-inch hard drives that spin at 5400RPM or 7200RPM. It&#8217;s easy to find 2.5-inch drives in large capacities for cheap, but the Mini 1000 doesn’t have room for one and uses a more compact 1.8-inch 4200RPM drive.  Competing products can be configured with much larger drives and this can be a deal breaker for users that like to schlep around all their multimedia files. The HP Mini 1035nr comes with a 60GB hard drive, which is the only hard drive option for the time being.  The cheaper base model comes with 8GB or 16GB of flash memory. The 60GB drive is more than sufficient for most users that are using the Mini 1000 as a secondary computer, but things can quickly get tight if it’s your only computer. One way to remedy this is to buy a 16GB SDHC card and keep it in the card slot to house some of your multimedia files.<br />
<strong><br />
HP Mini 1000 Display:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The HP Mini 1000 I reviewed has a 10.2-inch glossy display with a 1024&#215;600 pixel resolution.  The 10.2-inch display is a $50 option and I highly recommend it over the base 8.9-inch display. The screen is very bright, but I wish it had the same resolution (1280x 768) as the Mini Note 2133.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The infinity display gives the Mini 1000 a nice poslished look that&#8217;s consistent with the premium options available on the Pavilion dv series notebooks. The picture is sharp, clear and perfomrs as good as you can expect while indoors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I generally prefer matte (non-glossy) displays because of their versatility and lack of reflections. In bright direct light or outdoors it can be extremely difficult to read the display. As you can see the screen can be hard see while using in a car on a sunny day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_dispaly_sun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2434" title="mini_1000_dispaly_sun" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_dispaly_sun-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a><br />
There’s a mediocre Web-cam built into the display that is “good enough” for basic web chats, but the image is grainy, especially in low-lighting conditions. If you want to be a YouTube star you’re going to want to use an external Web cam with the Mini 1000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lid is latchless, which means there’s nothing holding the display to the palm-rest area. The lid doesn’t shut as firmly as I’d like it to making it possible for objects in your bag work their way in. I found a pen wedged in the gap once and I’m worried this issue can lead to possible screen damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Software:<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000 I reviewed came with Microsoft Windows XP Home SP3. I’ve taken a look at the Mobile Internet Experience (MIE) version of the HP Mini 1000 and think it’s a great option for many users, but I prefer being able to install Windows applications as needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ve been one of the few lucky people outside of HP to spend any time with a Mini 1000 with MIE and really liked what I saw. The Ubuntu (Linux) interface looks slick and inviting. It’s simplistic, yet has tools for nearly everything typical netbook users need. There’s an email client, Web browser, media players and the ability to add Linux compatible applications such as OpenOffice. Hopefully HP will make MIE available to all Mini 1000 owners when it&#8217;s released in January</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Check out the video I shot of the Mini 1000 with Mobile Internet Experience:<br />
<embed src="http://blip.tv/play/_U_WrSUA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="309" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed>The Windows-based HP Mini 1000 comes with Micorosft Works, which is a basic productivity suite that’s more than sufficient for editing Office documents and spreadsheets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000 iss relatively crap-ware free compared to most notebooks, which means you aren’t bombarded with countless offers and trialware that you have to remove yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Ports and Plugs:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2404" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-11" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-11-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a><br />
On the front edge of the Mini 1000 are two switches and two LEDs. The switch on the left is for power and the switch on the right is for the wireless antennas. This switch is useful as it’s a quick way to preserve battery life assuming you aren’t using any Bluetooth devices and aren’t connected to a WiFi network.  The LEDs indicate hard drive activity and charging status.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the right side of the notebook is a SD Card /MultiMedia Card reader, a USB port and a lanyard slot. Many netbooks and full-sized notebooks have shallow SD Card slots, which means your memory cards hang out of the side of your computer.  But the Mini 1000’s card slot is deep enough to hold the SD card flush to the side of the netbook.  This means you can stow an SD card semi-permanently in the Mini 1000 without worrying about knocking it out of the slot or losing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One quirk on the Mini 1000 is that models with a flash drive have a third USB-ish port that is recessed and accepts a proprietary memory card. It’s hidden behind a plastic door, but the port is absent on hard drive models. Space is at a premium on any netbook and HP should have used an industry-standard memory slot such as microSD instead of its own format. I have a feeling that very few users will use this port.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-8.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2397 aligncenter" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-8" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-8-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the left side of the Mini 1000 is an Ethernet jack hidden behind a rubber stopper, a headphone/microphone combo port, an expansion port, another USB 2.0 port and power port. The expansion port can be used to connect to an external monitor via a VGA adapter. The expansion port can also be used to connect to docking station that will charge the battery, connect to peripherals and pump video through to an external monitor and peripherals.<br />
I wish there were dedicated microphone and headphone jacks instead of the combo one, but space is limited because of the slim design.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Battery:<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000’s battery is a flat slab that’s positioned in the bottom of the notebook almost smack-dab in the middle.  It uses flat battery cells, which enable the thin design, but the battery doesn’t have as large of a capacity as other netbooks.<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-5-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2400" title="mini_1000_hp_netbook-5-1" src="http://www.notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mini_1000_hp_netbook-5-1-500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The standard HP Mini 1000 battery has 3-cells and lasted a hair under two hours and fifty minutes while web browsing and writing this review.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">HP is planning to sell a 6-cell extended battery that will be wedge-shaped and tilt the notebook forward. If you want all-day computing or to use a Mini 1000 on a cross country flight I recommend getting  the extended battery when it becomes available or doubling up on 3-cell batteries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Wireless:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All Mini 1000 netbooks come with 802.11b/g WiFi so you can connect to your home network and hotspots. Bluetooth is a $25 option on customizable models and standard on some quick-ship models such as the 1035nr I reviewed.  If you’re going to be using the Mini 1000 while on the go Bluetooth is a must-have option. I paired my Jawbone 2 headset to it to make Skype calls.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had no problems setting the Mini 1000 up to work on my home network. I was able to view TV programs on the Mini 1000 via my SlingBox Pro from a distance of about 40 feet without issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can order an integrated WWAN modem, for use with either AT&amp;T or Verizon’s mobile broadband service, for $199. These services are very expensive (about $60 per month with a 2-year contract). The cost of the service will quickly outpace the cost of the HP Mini 1000 and an affordable netbook might not bet the best choice if you have the budget for the WWAN service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HP Mini 1000 Audio<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000’s speakers are located beneath a metallic mesh cylinder at the hinge of the display.  In a quiet room they are audible and sound decent for their small size, but they’re not loud enough to use in a moderately noisy environment.  I highly recommend using wired or Bluetooth headphones if you want to listen to music or chat with your friends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Mini 1000 Packaging</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you plan on giving the Mini 1000 as a holiday gift you can rest assured that the recepient will have a very pleasant out-of-box experience. The box is actually nicer than the Pavilion line&#8217;s plain boxes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion:<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Mini 1000 I reviewed is an excellent choice and value for someone that understands the limitations of a netbook. It’s highly portable and its keyboard makes it much more useful than netbooks with smaller keys.<br />
The configuration in this review has a retail price of $464.99 and will provide the vast majority of consumers a solid portable web, email and productivity experience.  Business professionals looking for an enterprise-class computer should avoid the Mini 1000, along with all current netbooks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Geeks and gadget tweakers may not like the Mini 1000 either as there’s not as the Mini 1000 doesn’t lend itself to tweaking the same way slightly larger netbooks do.It’s the best looking netbook I’ve used so far and its upcoming Mobile Internet Experience makes Ubuntu approachable to long-time Windows users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you like what you see on the shelf, then by all means buy the Mini 1000. The Mini 1000 is available directly from HP and brick-and-mortar retailers such as Costco and Best Buy.  If you’re new to the netbook concept I recommend buying your Mini 1000 from Costco as they have a generous 90-day return policy on computers so you can decide if it&#8217;s right for you.</p>

<p>Chris Pirillo&#8217;s asking people to enter the contest by writing a how-to article on anything. I wrote an entry suggesting<a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2008/12/09/five-geeky-ways-to-give-back-to-the-world-even-if-you%E2%80%99re-broke/"> Five Geeky Ways to Give Back to the World, Even if You’re Broke.</a> (no I&#8217;m not eligible to win), but all of you are. Head over to geeks.pirillo.com, write a how-to article and whoever gets the most comments wins the package. The contest ends tomorrow so hurry.<br />
<a href="http://techmamas.typepad.com/main/2008/12/hp-magic-giveaway-techmamas.html">Techmamas</a> is looking for a mom &#8220;Hero&#8221; that can put the prizes to good use. To enter all you need to do is leave a thoughtful comment and link to as many resources as possible to help tell your story. They&#8217;re asking that the package be shared with a school or charity.</p>
<p><a href="http://planetx64.com/">Planet64</a> is asking readers to build a slide show using Animoto. I haven&#8217;t tried that tool out yet, but I&#8217;m going to give it a shot since Carlos says it&#8217;s a good tool.</p>
<p>update: just created the below video using Animoto and liked what I saw. Super easy slideshow tool and there&#8217;s already some holiday music you can use to create your own videos.It will take some time for the videos to render though. There&#8217;s an export to YouTube option built into Animoto and the guys at Planet64 are great if you want to geek out about AMD processors or DSLRs.</p>
<p>If I had a bunch of free computers these are the folks I&#8217;d be sharing with:</p>
<p>[There is a video that cannot be displayed in this feed. <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2008/12/09/dont-forget-to-enter-the-hp-magic-giveaway-more-sites/">Visit the blog entry to see the video.]</a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one more day to enter the <a href="http://geekstogo.com/">Geeks to Go </a>contest. All you need to do is leave a comment so this is an easy one to enter.</p>
<p><a href="http://geek.com">Geek.com</a> is holding a survey about netbooks and what kind of computer you plan on buying. There&#8217;s only three pages of buttons you need to click and it&#8217;s pretty painless.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t read Spanish, but if you do you have an advantage to enter <a href="http://noticiastech.com/">Noricias Tech&#8217;s</a> give away.</p>
<p>TechieDiva wants to hear what you&#8217;d do with the prize if you won it and is holding a random drawing. You can be selfish, charitable or sell it on eBay. TechDiva won&#8217;t hold it against you, but they do want  to hear your real story.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP&#8217;s lowered its pricing on the Mini 1000 series of netbooks, which now have a starting price of $359 at the HP Home &amp; Home Ofice store. As early as last week the Mini 1000 had a starting price of $399.</p>
<p>For $409 you can now configure the HP Mini with a 10.2-inch display , 1GB of RAM and 8GB of flash memory.</p>
<p>For $464.99 you can get a similar configuration, but with the 60GB hard drive instead of the flash memory.</p>
<p>The $359 price point is something I wasn&#8217;t expecting to see until after the holidays, when HP plans to release the HP Mini 1000 with a Linux operating system. Assuming pricing holds steady, the HP Mini 1000 with Linux should be around $329.</p>

<p>Thanks to SwtDreamer16 for the tips and you might want to try a few of these things out if you&#8217;re a Gmail user. </p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/community/comments.php?DiscussionID=12&#038;page=1#Item_9 ">forums</a>:</p>
<p>1) You can label each of your messages with a corresponding label, and you can also have multiple labels if the message goes under more than one category, very useful for when you are looking for specific documents corresponding to certain labels.</p>
<p>2)You can create groups within gmail in order to send out emails to specific groups such as family or co workers. This can be done by clicking on the contacts tab</p>
<p>3) Gmail has google docs which is extremely useful when it comes to group work because you can send documents and spreadsheets easily and they can easily be retrieved. All you have to do is to click on the documents tab on the top of the screen</p>
<p>4) Gmail also has a tool near the top of the screen that says &#8220;Search Mail&#8221; and this allows you to input keywords in order to find specific messages that you have within your inbox</p>
<p>5) Gmail has a calendar in which you can write down your schedule to share with others, or you can create a calendar that can be shared so that others can make changes. I find that it&#8217;s quite useful in delegating tasks and deciding on meetings.</p>
