        <summary>Prudent forward-looking professionally paranoid marketers should get started and get smarter about mobile media and marketing now. During the ascent phase (especialloy during the recession) prices are low, content and merchant partners are flexible and open to experimentation. The trick is to get an oar in the water before anybody gets a lock on a killer app, rolls out a game-changing technology or corners critical markesegments. Here are 5 tips to get started in framing your own mobile marketing program. Focus on Core Apps. Lead with your long suit. Decide which of your core products or services are most useful while customers are on the go and start there. Don’t try everything at once. Try one thing. Start with the service most in-demand by customers or prospects, the items that is most closely identified with your brand identity or your unique selling proposition. Start Small. The first step puts you squarely in test-and-learn mode. Ask customers to do one thing. Ask them to choose, vote, get a coupon, set an alert, or take an exclusive offer. The idea is to validate the channel and test your ability to influence incremental changes in behavior. You want to get them to do one thing, easily and quickly so that they like it it, appreciate the effort and add to their warm and fuzzy feelings about your brand. Market Across Platforms. Prepare for a range of phones and systems. Also prepare to have responses to mobile creative on the web, in e-mail or even by phone. Mobile apps are critical for a few but the real value-add for customers or prospects is rounding out the brand experience. Use a mobile test to get customers to respond to an e-mail or to an ad, to view and vote or to offer opinions about something they see or hear in another media channel. The idea is to associate your brand with your customers’ lifestyles in a way that they can easily interact with you. Make an Time-Sensitive Offer. In return for taking a mobile action within a fixed time frame customers should get a reward. Rewards can take the form of contest entries, discounts, and exclusive access to people, places or things or things of value like freebies or coupons. Mobile media is a direct response platform. Many customers come to it with expectations set by DR marketers. Ask About It. Do a post-action customer satisfaction survey using e-mail and mobile media to gauge customer reactions and gather customer input and feedback. Mobile marketing is evolving and who better to help you plan step number two than the folks who responded to your initial foray?</summary>

        <summary>Layoffs are a daily occurrence in this recession. Too many of my friends and colleagues have found themselves involuntarily benched. If thousands in each industry are on the street finding a new job requires a personal Zen that’s comprised of patience, routine, sustained confidence, steady action and considered risk-taking. To effectively seek work – you have to think like a marketer and market yourself as a brand. Identify your unique selling proposition, carefully target your potential new employers, craft persuasive messages and determine ways to get the attention and consideration you deserve. But be realistic. The toughest part of job hunting is managing your nerves and marshaling your resources. The good news is that thousands of others are in the same boat. There’s no embarrassment to being out of work. But that’s also the bad news; thousands are competing for hundreds of jobs. It’s a buyers market where some employers are trading up. Here are ten must-do steps to keep you sane and on track toward your next job: Create a Routine. Job hunting isn’t a full-time job, especially when the jobs you want are few and far between. Set up a daily routine. Check email, surf job boards, then walk the dog, exercise, meet friends for lunch and watch Oprah. Structure your day so that you do what you need to and reduce the likelihood that you’ll obsess about your circumstances. Prepare Your Pitch. You’ll need a killer resume with several variations, cover letters summarizing your greatest hits, references and selling points to acquaint headhunters with your strengths. These are messages you can control and shape. Writing and rewriting them gives you a sense of control and comfort and is something you can actually work on while you are waiting for the right opportunity. Anticipate the questions an interviewer might ask and prepare the answers. Make a list of people you worked with and your role in each assignment so you can quickly cite an example of how you fit the job specification. Spend time wordsmithing, be introspective and write like a journalist -- don’t bury the headline. You’ll have 5-10 seconds to grab somebody’s attention so pick your words carefully and be sure you are accenting your strongest selling points. Don’t Pitch Every Job. You are anxious with one eye on bills and the other on your savings account. But restrain yourself. Many of the jobs posted aren’t real. Many aren’t right for you no matter how much you’re worried about cash flow. Pick your shots. Take the time to craft a short, punchy cover letter that translates and matches your experience to the job requirements. Doing this math for an HR person will dramatically improve your chances of making a short list. Stutter Step Your Submission. The vast majority of online applications come in during the first 24 hours after a job is posted. Huge numbers of people are applying automatically to all kinds of jobs that they aren’t remotely qualified for. Many employers can’t handle the numbers so they dump the first response wave because nobody is willing to wade through 500 or 1000 resumes. So pick your shot, wait a day and then apply. There is a reasonable chance that patience and timing will earn you more consideration. Set Alerts. Let jobs find you. Do a search using the keywords that fit your ideal position or your dominant skill set. Save the search as an alert. You can do this in 45 seconds on Craig’s List or at www.indeed.com, www.simplyhired.com, www.trovix.com, or www.jobster.com. Each day the jobs most interesting to you will end up in your Inbox. If you like, set more than one using keywords for different titles or different industry sectors. All you have to do is sort out the duplicates and decide where to click to apply. Surf Social Networks. Let you r Facebook and MySpace friends know you are looking and sign up for professional groups or forums on Ning, Naymz and LinkedIn where many jobs are posted and many recruiters are lurking. Also check trade association and trade publication sites and industry newsletters many of which either have job listings or report on openings, new positions and employer’s plans. Don’t Be Bashful. You can’t win if you don’t play. Tell people you are looking and what you are looking for. Most people assume that friends and family know their situation and will do the math for them. This is usually NOT true. And, while it might make you blush, you...</summary>

So while you’ve got the time share your expertise by publishing a blog or positing thoughts, comments, opinions or advice on blogs, portals, professional communities, media sites or job boards.

This will require you to dig, ping your network, ask around and to push the recruiters; who often don’t know this stuff themselves. But be persistent. These critical elements vary widely within industries and even under corporate or holding company umbrellas. Understanding how and when you intersect with the on-going search is the most important piece of intelligence you can get because it will shape the way you position yourself and cue you about how to persuade them to hire you. </font></p>

        <summary>Millions of people have started using social media in the last year. 49 million visited MySpace or Facebook in October 2008. But more than half (55%) of 180 Chief Marketing Officers from medium to giant brands aren’t interested. What’s up with that? Could it really be that the marketing leaders of top consumer and B2B brands really don’t care that Facebook and MySpace have aggregated huge audiences which are can be targeted using a range of psycho-demographic criteria or are these the guys who are so out of touch they can’t hold the job for more than a year and a half? My hunch is neither. I suspect that the survey, done by GfK Roper Public Affairs on behalf of Epsilon, a leading direct marketing services company, reflects more caution and uncertainty than outright stupidity. It’s not a stretch to guess that CMOs are skeptical about these large looming communities. Here’s why: They’re Too New. There’s no track record, only anecdotal results. There are no proven strategies, no best practices, no brands claiming victory, no clear buying tools or metrics and the weenies who typically become CMOs won’t do anything that somebody hadn’t already pre-chewed and pre-digested for them. There isn&#39;t any agreement on what marketers should use social networks for. Are the awareness, preference or sales building vehicles? Remember these are the same guys who are just beginning to recognize and cautiously test the Internet as a viable media channel. And their doubts are probably nurtured by the sites themselves who are immature at packaging, selling and merchandizing the audiences they’ve attracted. Nobody Wants Ads. The primal attraction of these sites is the absence of advertising and the joy of connection, sharing and communication between friends. Marketers don’t know how to join the party and have few organic connections with which to “friend” customers and prospects. Gaining entrée, framing the message, devising creative executions and knowing how and when to communicate are all open questions. And while a brand like the New York Times can collect 183,000 Facebook fans and send 400,000 virtual gifts, most CMOs don’t know what to make of it. Is this a good, so-so or bad result? The social networks haven’t sufficiently answered the “so what” challenge. Not Sure Whose There. CMOs are asking the question Butch repeatedly asked Sundance, “Who are those guys?” The preliminary answers aren’t encouraging despite the fact that 57% of users log in daily and spend more than 30 minutes per session, according to IDC. Steve Cone, Epsilon’s CMOsays “the sites narrowly appeal to high school and college students.” But he’s a year behind the power curve and has a vested interest in selling CMOs other digital assets. A P&amp;G executive was quoted as asking “who wants to put our message on a site where somebody is breaking up with their girlfriend?” And Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff really pooped on MySpace users saying they are “poor cretins” none of whom “has beyond an 8th grade education.” CMOs used to relying on and hiding behind refined demographic and psychographic data won’t buy a pig in a poke. No Control. Social networks are party lines. Anyone can edit, review or comment on almost anything. It’s the antithesis of advertising which has for decades carefully placed well-crafted and well-researched messages in precise pages and in precise time slots to meet well defined audiences. You can’t interrupt programming with an ad or push a message to people on social networks. This is the exact opposite of 60 years of advertising practice and experience. Few CMOs have a risk appetite to take a flyer or to potentially associate their brand (by design or default) with an uncontrolled range of ideas, associations, images or messages. Don’t expect mainstream marketers to break with tradition or inertia easily. Limited Metrics. Cookies don’t work on social networks. Measuring anything is a leap of faith. Whole Foods distributes coupons. BlendTec circulates wacky product demonstration videos, and Reebok encourages runners. But we can’t calculate the ROI, measure media efficiency or gauge relative effectiveness using the media metrics we’ve come to know and love. Absent numbers, few media buys get made. The really message in the survey results is that we are clearly in the early adopter phase where mainstream marketers watch the early experimenters and try to gauge value and effectiveness. Advocates of social media need to develop a different marketing paradigm to either translate or replace the lens used by marketers to assess and buy media channels.

        <summary>The prudent forward-looking professionally paranoid marketer will get started and get smarter about mobile media and marketing now, during the ascent phase while prices are low, content and merchant partners are flexible and open to experimentation and before anybody gets a lock on a killer app, game-changing technology or critical market segments. The holiday appeal and uptake of smartphones should be enough to convince you to try a mobile marketing test Here are 5 tips to get started in framing your own mobile marketing program. Focus on Core Apps. Lead with your long suit. Decide which of your core products or services are most useful while customers are on the go and start there. Don’t try everything at once. Try one thing; the service most in-demand by customers or prospects, the items that is most closely identified with your brand identity or your unique selling proposition. Start Small. The first step puts you squarely in test- and-learn mode. Ask customers to do one thing. Ask them to choose, vote, get a coupon, set an alert, or take an exclusive offer. The idea is to validate the channel and test your ability to influence incremental changes in behavior. You want to get them to do one thing, easily and quickly so that they like it it, appreciate the effort and add to their warm and fuzzy feelings about your brand. Market Across Platforms. Mobile apps are critical for a few but the real value-add for customers and prospects is in rounding out the brand experience. Use a mobile test to get customers to respond to an e-mail or to an ad, to view and vote or to offer opinions about something they see or hear in another media channel. Make an Offer. In return for taking a mobile action within a fixed time frame customers should get a reward. Rewards can take the form of contest entries, discounts, and exclusive access to people, places or things or things of value like freebies or coupons. Mobile media is a direct response platform. Many customers come to it with expectations set by DR marketers. Ask About It. Do a post-action customer satisfaction survey using e-mail and mobile media to gauge customer reactions and gather customer input and feedback. Mobile marketing is evolving and who better to help you plan step number two than the folks who responded to your initial foray?</summary>

        <title>Web 3.0: Brand Strategy Must Drive Integrated Interactive Marketing</title>

        <summary>Web 2.0 was about finding, developing and embracing interactive technologies to engage customers, prospects and other constituencies. Web 3.0, says Clark Kokich of Razorfish, is about integrating these cool new toys to work together to achieve business results. While Michael Leis jokes about the nomenclature, Clark’s underlying thought is spot on; the holy grail of integrated digital marketing is to frame a vision of a fully realized multi-dimensional interactive relationship between a brand and its customer base and then implement that vision using the latest and greatest tools we can find to achieve predictable business results. It’s a grand and very difficult to achieve grail. Why? Four reasons. 1. Because it forces us to get past the “amazing” features of each new tool and focus on end-user benefits rather than first user bragging rights. 2. Because the tools are constantly evolving and we are unlikely to settle on a few at the risk of missing the next big thing. 3. Because it requires both agencies and clients to overcome organizational and attitudinal silos with their attendant politics of self-interest in service to a greater goal. 4. Because it requires marketers to balance measurable business effectiveness against probable marketing efficiencies which demand a combination of proven tactics and carefully considered experiments; risks that both agencies and clients are generally afraid of. But there is a way forward, if marketers would adopt these four tactics: Follow a Boss. Altitude is the only predictor of successful marketing integration. Somebody at the top of the organization (possibly a CMO) has to be the boss, make decisions, broker arguments, set the direction and establish the party line. It’s a stick-your-neck-out posture that requires vision, guts and political savvy. Too many post-modern, post-industrialist MBA-trained managers publicly shrink from the very notion of a boss, but without it, the natural politics of bureaucracies will overwhelm and undermine any effort. Build Consensus Goals. The most effective marketers have a vision that sets a goal which then determines a logical series of priorities that drive creative, channel and spending decisions. This is that big strategy piece that everyone talks about and aspires to but few actually accomplish. A broad but quantifiable goal gives context to all the varied tactics and lays out hypotheses for finding synergy within an organization and its marketing partners which can be mapped out as tactics and executed in a coordinated and thoughtful way through a set of channels. The game is won on the choice of strategy not on the choice of channels. Harness the Mule Team. Nothing great ever gets done unless everyone is in-harness and pulling in the same direction. This requires the greatest application of energy and force and is most affected by staffing choices and vendor selection. Nobody sets out to create a dysfunctional operation, but too many of us end up with one because we don’t have the discipline or the appetite to harness, direct and motivate our team in a single direction. Picture &amp; Measure an End State. Too many marketing efforts attack immediate pain points or address immediate problem areas. Not enough start with an understanding of what the brand needs and wants in terms of its relationship with clients and their identification with the brand that drives adoption and purchase of its products or services. Brands need to set awareness, preference, attitudinal, purchase, loyalty and interactive goals, and then deploy marketing programs to engage customers to achieve the stated objectives. Then measurements of business effectiveness and internal efficiencies can be used to genuinely steer the ship.</summary>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">CMO</span></p></st1:stockticker><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">) has to be the boss, make decisions, broker arguments, set the direction and establish the party line. It’s a stick-your-neck-out posture that requires vision, guts and political savvy. Too many post-modern, post-industrialist MBA-trained managers publicly shrink from the very notion of a boss, but without it, the natural politics of bureaucracies will overwhelm and undermine any effort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Build Consensus Goals</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">. The most effective marketers have a vision that sets a goal which then determines a logical series of priorities that drive creative, channel and spending decisions. This is that big strategy piece that everyone talks about and aspires to but few actually accomplish. A broad but quantifiable goal gives context to all the varied tactics and lays out hypotheses for finding synergy within an organization and its marketing partners which can be mapped out as tactics and executed in a coordinated and thoughtful way through a set of channels. The game is won on the choice of strategy not on the choice of channels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Harness the Mule Team</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">. Nothing great ever gets done unless everyone is in-harness and pulling in the same direction. This requires the greatest application of energy and force and is most affected by staffing choices and vendor selection. Nobody sets out to create a dysfunctional operation, but too many of us end up with one because we don’t have the discipline or the appetite to harness, direct and motivate our team in a single direction. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Not enough start with an understanding of what the brand needs and wants in terms of its relationship with clients and their identification with the brand that drives adoption and purchase of its products or services. Brands need to set awareness, preference, attitudinal, purchase, loyalty and interactive goals, and then deploy marketing programs to engage customers to achieve the stated objectives.

        <summary>Mobile marketing is on the cusp of moving markets and deserves consideration as part of the marketing mix for a wide variety of products and services. No longer the province of teenagersor a parlor trick prepetrated by a nerdy early adopter, mobile media is gaining widespread use as new phones and new software make the Internet accessible everywhere. In no time we&#39;ll all be tethered to the digital grid; connected by a single multi-functional device. Consider several recent developments: Almost two-thirds (63%) of cellphone users have received e-mail, used text messaging or obtained news and sports information on their phones. More than one-third (38%) of mobile phone users access the Internet from their phone. There are 40 million smart phones in use, closing in on 20 percent of the cell phones in use and the market is growing; driven by iPhones and Blackberry Pearls and Curves. 130 million phones have &quot;highly capable Internet browsers&quot; and the IBM Institute for Business Value survey recently found that 40% of those surveyed had Internet data plans in-use and that a third of those had already watched a video on their phones. Once you start watching video on your phone, 45% begin to do it regularly which according to Black Arrow cumes up to 800 million hours of mobile video viewing, still a tiny slice of the 389 billion hours of broadcast TV watched, but a bell weather nonetheless. Evidently we have begun to solve the technical issues of compression, design and compatibility that bring the Internet off the desktop and out of the laptop and into our on-the-go daily lives. You can bet this trend will continue. Continuous improvements in speed, signal clarity and software integration will lead to a single compact, personalized device that becomes an indispensable tool for managing communication, interaction, commerce and most practical aspects of our lives. Dick Tracy&#39;s wrist watch video phone and the Star Trek communicator already exist. Soon we&#39;ll all be using their progeny. Think about the mobile applications that people we know have already rely on. Many people use their phones to search, get news alerts or sports scores, interact with TV shows, vote or take surveys, play games, send or view photos,get directions or actually talk or text with other humans. Facebook access from mobile devices has grown 3X in the last year to 15 million users and who knows how many other social networks are making similar claims as we get used to the idea of telling everybody what we&#39;re doing in real time and sharing everything we find, like or do with a gang of unseen others. The NFL streams video of games to mobile phones, Sears2Go.com allows you to buy Craftsman tools using a phone and a Disney-Verizon alliance will use cell phones to interact with kids and families while they&#39;re in the parks as early as next year. Progress in m-commerce is making the interfaces and downloads between websites and phones easier, smoother and less kluge-y day by day. Soon mobile wallet applications will allow us to use our phones to fill up parking meters, buy from vending machines, purchase movie tickets, check out quickly at retail stores and complete complex financial transactions from a phone keypad. And while there are a few indications that consumers expect and will tolerate advertising surrounding these nifty new tricks, its not really clear how much and what kind of messaging will resonate.Therefore the prudent forward-looking professionally paranoid marketer will get started and get smarter about mobile media and marketing now, during the ascent phase while prices are low, content and merchant partners are flexible and open to experimentation and before anybody develops a killer app, gets a lock on game-changing technology or establishes a beachhead in critical market segments.</summary>

        <summary>Bad times are perfect opportunities to test media and try the wacky ideas that have been percolating within your organization. The economy is in free fall. The shift to digital media has begun but hasn&#39;t been fully realized even as print and other traditional media are suffering mightily. Enter the former high priestess of the dot-com bubble, Morgan Stanley&#39;s Mary Meeker, with her insights into Internet Trends. Social networks, Voice over IP (VoIP) and web video are the rage attracting large audiences and provoking considerable pass-along. Think YouTube, Facebook, Skype and PalPal.But these drivers of user growth are not necessarily ad friendly either from the perspective of site functionality or from the perspective of audience sensibility. In banker&#39;s terms they are under-monetized because nobody has yet figured out how to get commercial messages embedded in ways that last longer than 15 seconds and that are engaging enough to overcome a hair-trigger sensibility about SPAM and unwanted online ads. Because users think of these sites and others as personal utilities which encorage customization and opt-ins, they expect them to be free of anything they haven&#39;t asked for or specifically chosen. As a result the costs to experiment with these media are relatively cheap and the low CPMs make them atrtractive to brands looking to stick their toes in the online pond. What Mary doesn&#39;t say is that we have both a credibility and a creative problem. On one hand netziens are rebelling against the gross commercialization of the sites they like the best. They aren&#39;t watching pre-rolls and they want their web video free of intrusive ads. For the most part TV ads translated to the web and the web-centric video ads have the usual track record for advertising -- most are misses and few are hits in terms of popular resonance and pass-along buzz. When you get past the sites driving usage and interaction and go back to the thousands of sites now represented by the hundreds of ad networks, we have an inventory glut of legendary proportions where low CPMs are matched by even lower credibility and lower creative expectations, From a branding or a direct response perspective banners in most shapes and sizes, with and without rich media applications, suck. Add to this general belief serious doubts about click fraud, parity among networks and large numbers of advertisers who have spent big money for little return and you have a buyers market with huge opportunities to pick up and test affordable campaigns, assuming you can create messages that are compelling. Its also time to test re-marketing and behavioral targeting, both use nominally sophisticated techniques to follow people and serve them up messages based on directly expressed or inferred interests.. The trick is to negotiate low prices and to guess right in terms of the messages and offers served up. For many of my clients these experiments have had the most interesting runs and have returned the greatest ROI in the shortest time periods. For some unexplainable reason many new start-ups and services expect advertisers to make good on their business plans, even in a global recession. There will be all kinds of mobile Internet, 3G devices and place-based media joining the fray for the shrinking pot of ad dollars. Many of these will be interesting, but unproven ideas, and if money remains tight you&#39;ll have a chance to play with them on the cheap. Though look to prove conceptual validity rather than strong branding results or significant leads and direct sales. Miss Mary says &quot;value&quot; is the key to growth and survival. Offer advertisers much more for their money and offer consumers and web surfers deals when and where they want them. Bad times spell opportunity to break out of existing patterns, test-and-learn new tactics and gain awareness or market share by leveraging low negotiable prices. Its a time to go for it not to run away from it.</summary>

        <published>2008-11-05T17:58:39-05:00</published>
        <updated>2008-11-05T17:58:40-05:00</updated>
        <summary>The practice of public relations, especially media relations, is making a transition from semi-traditional press agentry to the digital age. In working with both PR agencies and clients, it is clear that the recession will further complicate the process of getting attention and visibility for brands. Here are 11 things to do to help smooth the transition. Integrate Channels. A publicity campaign is a multi-media event. Be sure that your website, your customer service representatives, your front line customer-facing employees and your printed materials are aligned and on-message. Think about what you are going to say and anticipate how, when and to whom your customers, prospects, investors, employees or competitors might react. Coordinate your announcements with other sales, marketing and out reach activities including e-mail, blogs, circulars, position papers, speeches, appearances and trade shows so that your brand speaks with a single, clear and consistent voice. Don’t Rely on Releases. The press release is the classic vehicle for communicating with journalists because they mirror the style and content found in the media. Many marketers think that the creation and transmission of a press release constitutes communication and persuasion. Nothing could be further from the truth. Press releases are a dime a dozen. They vary widely in quality and content and are frequently ignored by the intended recipients. As you compose your message consider a broad array of vehicles to transmit information. In many cases a short e-mail or voice mail message with punchy pitch points will work better. In other cases Op-Eds or letters to the editor or comments and feedback to blogs or published pieces are far better vehicles to get your message on the record. Leverage News Cycles. Each day has a news cycle and on an annual basis there are predictable sand evergreen stories that our 24/7 media cover. You can increase the likelihood of coverage by understanding and tracking these cycles and connecting your news to these patterns. Do the Math. You have an affirmative burden to link your news to ideas in the media, topics on the national agenda or subjects in widespread conversation. A new announcement without context and missing links to broader themes dies quickly of loneliness. You must also explain clearly and persuasively why your news matters, who it matters to and why anyone should care. Too often things that matter to you have little or no significance to broader audiences. The media serves as a gatekeeper to local, national, professional or global audiences. Think Like an Editor. News has to be new, different and significant in both absolute and relative terms. Reporters, producers and bloggers covering your industry or business can assess these elements in a nanosecond and grant you a hearing or close you down instantly. In framing any news release, announcement or pitch these elements have to be clear and up front. Make a Target Press List. Every business, industry and sector is covered by dedicated journalists. In some cases, its a challenge to figure out who naturally covers you because the number of journalists is shrinking and the amount of interconnection and overlap between topics is increasing. Err on the side of adding more names to your list because while the number of writers and reporters is shrinking the number of distribution outlets is increasing. So as you figure out who follows your business, each voice is likely to carry farther. Then figure out which media your most likely customers and prospects watch, read and follow and make a list of these outlets. Everybody really pays attention to a couple of sources and many of these sources can be predicted based on the age and business tenure of your customer base. Nobody can follow everything so don’t sweat the big picture. Zero-in on what the people you care about most do. The combination of these lists should be your primary media targets. Call and e-mail these people and keep the list as up-to-date as possible. Savor Search. Nine in ten journalists search the Web for story ideas, news sources and to check out people and companies they are covering or considering. Being found on Google, Yahoo and other search engines must to be a part of every PR program. This requires an understanding of natural search tactics, demands coordination between online and offline media channels and can be expedited by using the web for press release distribution. Optimize Keywords. We live on a word filtered, sorted and governed by key words. As you conceptualize your news or information...</summary>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The practice of public relations, especially media relations, is making a transition from semi-traditional press agentry to the digital age. In working with both PR agencies and clients, it is clear that the recession will further complicate the process of getting attention and visibility for brands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Here are 11 things to do to help smooth the transition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Integrate Channels</strong>. A publicity campaign is a multi-media event. Be sure that your website, your customer service representatives, your front line customer-facing employees and your printed materials are aligned and on-message. Think about what you are going to say and anticipate how, when and to whom your customers, prospects, investors, employees or competitors might react. Coordinate your announcements with other sales, marketing and out reach activities including e-mail, blogs, circulars, position papers, speeches, appearances and trade shows so that your brand speaks with a single, clear and consistent voice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Don’t Rely on Releases</strong>. The press release is the classic vehicle for communicating with journalists because they mirror the style and content found in the media. Many marketers think that the creation and transmission of a press release constitutes communication and persuasion. Nothing could be further from the truth. Press releases are a dime a dozen. They vary widely in quality and content and are frequently ignored by the intended recipients. As you compose your message consider a broad array of vehicles to transmit information. In many cases a short e-mail or voice mail message with punchy pitch points will work better. In other cases Op-Eds or letters to the editor or comments and feedback to blogs or published pieces are far better vehicles to get your message on the record. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Leverage News Cycles</strong>. Each day has a news cycle and on an annual basis there are predictable sand evergreen stories that our 24/7 media cover. You can increase the likelihood of coverage by understanding and tracking these cycles and connecting your news to these patterns. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Do the Math.</strong> You have an affirmative burden to link your news to ideas in the media, topics on the national agenda or subjects in widespread conversation. A new announcement without context and missing links to broader themes dies quickly of loneliness. You must also explain clearly and persuasively why your news matters, who it matters to and why anyone should care. Too often things that matter to you have little or no significance to broader audiences. The media serves as a gatekeeper to local, national, professional or global audiences. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Think Like an Editor.</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160; </span>News has to be new, different and significant in both absolute and relative terms. Reporters, producers and bloggers covering your industry or business can assess these elements in a nanosecond and grant you a hearing or close you down instantly. In framing any news release, announcement or pitch these elements have to be clear and up front.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Make a Target Press List.</strong> Every business, industry and sector is covered by dedicated journalists. In some cases, its a challenge to figure out who naturally covers you because the number of journalists is shrinking and the amount of interconnection and overlap between topics is increasing. Err on the side of adding more names to your list because while the number of writers and reporters is shrinking the number of distribution outlets is increasing. So as you figure out who follows your business, each voice is likely to carry farther. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then figure out which media your most likely customers and prospects watch, read and follow and make a list of these outlets. Everybody really pays attention to a couple of sources and many of these sources can be predicted based on the age and business tenure of your customer base. Nobody can follow everything so don’t sweat the big picture. Zero-in on what the people you care about most do. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The combination of these lists should be your primary media targets. Call and e-mail these people and keep the list as up-to-date as possible.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Savor Search</strong>. Nine in ten journalists search the Web for story ideas, news sources and to check out people and companies they are covering or considering. Being found on Google, Yahoo and other search engines must to be a part of every PR program. This requires an understanding of natural search tactics, demands coordination between online and offline media channels and can be expedited by using the web for press release distribution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Optimize Keywords.</strong> We live on a word filtered, sorted and governed by key words. As you conceptualize your news or information you have think about which terms, phrases, and jargon will be used to quickly communicate meaning. These same words and terms must be used frequently in your documents as keywords which can be searched efficiently in cyberspace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Act Like a Telemarketer.</strong> The disparity between the number of journalists and the huge demand for attention makes most media people hide. They have unlisted phone numbers, send all calls immediately to voicemail, publish e-mail addresses for mailboxes they never look at, don’t respond to e-mail and get really annoyed if you try to pitch them using IM or social media. They appear to be friendly, open and accessible but vigorously screen themselves from unwanted or unsolicited pitches. Reaching working journalists is like telemarketing. You have to be canny, call frequently and be satisfied with a very low response rate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Be Social</strong>. Social networks are becoming American’s preferred platforms for ideas and conversation. You can not afford to ignore these big and growing communities. A PR campaign should create specific messages and tools to leverage the interactivity and viral potential of online communities because they give you an opportunity to marshal and direct brand advocates and evangelists, enlist new customers and prospects to your cause and reach people who may have great interest but little awareness of your brand and its offerings. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Monitor the Conversation</strong>. Set Google Alerts to track themes and competitive messages. Become familiar with Digg, Technorati and Twitter which allow you to gauge the frequency and intensity of topics in-motion and concepts in-flux. Register and participate in Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, LinkedIn and any other social network that has relevance to and participation from your employees, customers, competitors or prospects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;&#0160; </span></span></p>

Or maybe I missed it because the Times hasn&#39;t really opened my eyes to this digital world because its marketers are trapped in a print cirrculation paradigm and haven&#39;t reached me with either direct or digital marketing. Now that I&#39;m learning to use social networks and helping clients get their arms around the digital world, I guess I have to re-imagine the daily newspaper and see it as a hub of information and interaction rather than just the great gray lady that arrives on my doorstep every morning.</summary>

        <summary>When your 80-year old mother forwards a video to you each day and your mother-in-law writes a blog, you can’t help but pay attention to the growth, acceptance and utility of social media. According to Forrester’s 2008 Social Technographic Profile, three out of four US adults use web technologies and tools to connect with other people and to share information. Adoption has grown from 56 percent just a year ago. We have always been a very social culture. Lacking an overt class structure and the conventions of the old countries where social mobility was severely limited, we have long traditions of sharing information, open commentary and feedback, collective opinion polling and creative expression. We are a nation of voters, critics, reviewers and satirists. Mark Zuckerberg showed up millions of people were participating in discussion boards, user-groups, chat rooms and professional online forums of many stripes. Blogs, photo and video-sharing like Flickr, RSS feeds, Twitter, del.icio.us and Digg are the latest evolution of our need to say what we think and tell others. Social networks are the digital extension and expression of our love of clubs and fraternal organizations, an update on Aunt Blabby’s annual newsy Christmas letter and an outlet to empower and unleash our inner yentas. The early adopters have jumped into social networks to the tune of $920 million according to eMarketer, three-quarters of which was spent on MySpace (51%) and Facebook (19%). Like most early adapters the attention gets focused on the means rather than the marketing strategy. Every marketer you meet fantasizes about creating a low-cost viral video that skyrockets them to fame and ROI-heaven with millions of free page views and mentions or replays in the mainstream media. This fantasy is validated by a Feed Company survey in which 71% of creative executives believe that viral video will become a standard marketing practice in one to three years. Forty-one percent of clients told Jupiter they intend to upload video to social network sites in the next twelve months. The hold-up, according to the Jupiter Research’s 2008 Advertiser Executive Survey, is cost, anxiety about adapting existing TV creative and doubts about targeting. The critical questions for marketers are: How do we insert ourselves credibly into these networks and conversations? What’s the optimal use of this two-way communication and distribution channel? The answer begins with an appreciation of how these new networks are evolving and how people are electing to participate. Social media is evolving like cable TV did, from the broad initial pioneers who prove the concept and attract mass audiences to niche channels that hyper-serve specific market segments or aggregate content into broader sub-categories like dating, health or careers. If MySpace is the pioneer then LinkedIn is the B2B play and the contenders for other spots along the spectrum are beginning to line up. Josh Bernoff talks about a Social Technographics Ladder, a pretentious sounding 6-step construct, to illustrate how people actually use and participate in social media. This idea suggests that some people are online but “Inactive.” They basically don’t care about any of this. “Spectators” read blogs, watch videos and are passive voyeurs. “Joiners” sign up for things, create profiles and visit sites regularly. “Collectors” are one notch up; using RSS feeds, recommending and voting for content and adding tags to web pages. “Critics” are active participants posting their own content, commenting on blogs, or adding to and editing wikis. And “Creators” sit atop the social media food chain publishing blogs, posting images, making videos, creating mash-ups and downloading music. It’s a fair bet that the ladders map to a bell curve with “Inactives” at the right and “Creators” at the left. The hump is moving to the left as more people do more things. Breakout Solutions, a Fort Lauderdale software provider, called this state of affairs a “social media revolution” and advised its clients, “Whenever a new discipline is introduced that changes the entire dynamics of what influences consumer buying decisions and how you deliver your marketing message, you simply cannot afford to remain unresponsive and stagnant in formulating new strategies to meet business objectives.” And while I wouldn’t put it quite that way, I agree. So here are five things to do to seed social media into your marketing strategy. Find Your Peeps. It’s all about targeting. The goal is to comfortably intersect with your customers and prospects. In some cases you can add social media elements to your web site and to your marketing campaigns. In other cases it makes...</summary>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The critical questions for marketers are: How do we insert ourselves credibly into these networks and conversations? What’s the optimal use of this two-way communication and distribution channel?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></span>&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The answer begins with an appreciation of how these new networks are evolving and how people are electing to participate. Social media is evolving like cable TV did, from the broad initial pioneers who prove the concept and attract mass audiences to niche channels that hyper-serve specific market segments or aggregate content into broader sub-categories like dating, health or careers. If MySpace is the pioneer then LinkedIn is the B2B play and the contenders for other spots along the spectrum are beginning to line up.</font></p>

This idea suggests that some people are online but “Inactive.” They basically don’t care about any of this. “Spectators” read blogs, watch videos and are passive voyeurs. “Joiners” sign up for things, create profiles and visit sites regularly. “Collectors” are one notch up; using RSS feeds, recommending and voting for content and adding tags to web pages. “Critics” are active participants posting their own content, commenting on blogs, or adding to and editing wikis. And “Creators” sit atop the social media food chain publishing blogs, posting images, making videos, creating mash-ups and downloading music. It’s a fair bet that the ladders map to a bell curve with “Inactives” at the right and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“Creators” at the left. The hump is moving to the left as more people do more things.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a href="http://www.breakoutsolutions.com ">Breakout Solutions</a>, a Fort Lauderdale software provider, called this state of affairs a “social media revolution” and advised its clients, “Whenever a new discipline is introduced that changes the entire dynamics of what influences consumer buying decisions and how you deliver your marketing message, you simply cannot afford to remain unresponsive and stagnant in formulating new strategies to meet business objectives.” And while I wouldn’t put it quite that way, I agree. So here are five things to do to seed social media into your marketing strategy. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Find Your Peeps.</strong> It’s all about targeting. The goal is to comfortably intersect with your customers and prospects. In some cases you can add social media elements to your web site and to your marketing campaigns. In other cases it makes more sense to go where they are already going. Think like an anthropologist. Find your people. Watch what they say and do. Look for patterns. Ask them what they like and what they want. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Dare to Be Embarrassed</strong>. Social media shifts control from brands to customers. It’s about what they think and what they want; not what you’re pushing. Some think you suck. But you knew that and it’s okay. To embrace social networks is to risk being next to content that you don’t control, to receive and respond to reviews and criticism you’re not used to and possibly to take your brand not so seriously.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Lead with Your Long Suit</strong>. Social networks give brands the opportunity to expose things they know, showcase expertise, present ideas or designs, float trial balloons and introduce personalities. It’s an unparalleled chance to invite customers and prospect into your world. Don’t underestimate how into your brand your best customers are. Don’t be bashful. Put your people and your best stuff out there. Don’t let the lawyers tell you otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#0160;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Play Around.</strong> We’re in the early stages. There are no proven formulas and no real best practices. It’s a real chance to play around by asking users to send in things, participate in contests, answer survey questions, sample products or services, download coupons, upload photos and who knows what else? Test and learn your way to greatness. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Play to the Cheap Seats.</strong> Social media is like talk radio or old fashioned telephone party lines. A tiny percent call but everybody is listening. The beauty of having friends and linkages is seeing what they are doing and watching them experiment from the sidelines. The numbers of passive and occasional users far outnumber the hardcore players, even among the younger demographic groups. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span>But don’t ignore them because they’re getting off and getting their own ideas watching what goes on.</span></p></div>
