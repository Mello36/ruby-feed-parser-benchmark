Well, it's a 45-minute online conversation that &lt;em&gt;features industry news and interview with industry executives, analysts, practitioners, consultants, and really anybody who has an interest and stake in the puzzling world of HR Technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Lafata, Vice President of Sales &amp;amp; Marketing for HRchitect, is the host of the WebMingle and interviewer.  The first show with Mark was an invaluable journey into the steel-trap mind of a marketing/PR maestro.  I ain't kidding.  It was really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://hrchitect.wordpress.com/2008/12/08/first-hrchitect-happy-hour-webmingle-a-huge-success/"&gt;Matt's blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As somebody who has been involved in marketing for many years, I was particularly interested to hear Mark's position on many different areas and he provided a great deal of insight. He was certainly preaching to the choir with me in regards to many of the topics he touched on and I hope people enjoyed hearing what he had to say. One particular piece of information that I have also been a huge proponent of was when Mark re-iterated that a slow or bad economy is no time to cut marketing efforts. These efforts should stay the same or increase as others are going to panic and cut budgets and those that stay the course are more likely to weather the storm. In any event, lots of great information and I encourage you to listen to the interview at your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/mattlafata"&gt;You can listen to the WebMingle archive here on blogtalkradio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up next, this Friday, December 12, at 11:00 a.m. PT, Adam Feigenbaum from iCIMS, the winner of &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-hrchitect-beauty-pageant.html"&gt;HRchitect's Talent Acquisition Systems Beauty Pageant Webinar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Kevin Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/7463996236991369354/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=7463996236991369354' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/7463996236991369354?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7463996236991369354'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/12/mingle-bells-mingle-bells-mingle-all.html' title='Mingle Bells, Mingle Bells, Mingle All The Way'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-9171675711964225160</id><published>2008-12-08T14:52:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-08T15:00:04.992-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-12-08T15:00:04.992-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='401k participation rates'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Best Buy'/><title type='text'>Social Media Can Improve 401k Participation Rates</title><content type='html'>&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week one of our team members attended a Webinar about the power of Web 2.0 in talent management.  One of the highlights was how &lt;a href="http://www.bestbuy-jobs.com/careers/"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; increased their 401k participation by 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30%?  How the heck did they do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a contest.  A video contest.  They asked employees throughout the retail chain to submit motivating videos that would help increase overall 401k participation.  They did just that and the winner is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, creative employee engagement does motivate and help with retention (well the hopefully solid 401k is helping retention in this economic mudslide we're in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of creative "social media" initiatives, coupled with employer financial education programs and auto-enrollment and online plan management tools, can help retain an already incredibly unsteady workforce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/newsviewer.php?ppa=6prjo%60%5CmrlgimtYSgew11rbfen_"&gt;recent press release by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans&lt;/a&gt; (also an HRmarketer member), 43% of U.S. respondents offer financial education/literacy programs for their workers.  And this number will only increase next year as the &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;amp;sid=ao_8cZPMC0cE&amp;amp;refer=home"&gt;economy is predicted to become bleaker before it improves&lt;/a&gt;.  And Julie Stich, Senior Information/Research Specialist with the IFEBP stated that "with the economy affecting retirement plans, employees are taking a greater interest in their retirement future."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course we are.  No more &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;amp;story_id=12274112"&gt;weapons of financial mass destruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, check out the winning video...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VqpKgTmkHIk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VqpKgTmkHIk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Kevin Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/9171675711964225160/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=9171675711964225160' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/9171675711964225160?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/9171675711964225160'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/12/social-media-can-improve-401k.html' title='Social Media Can Improve 401k Participation Rates'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-2762913414980358177</id><published>2008-12-03T09:39:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-03T09:40:53.706-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-12-03T09:40:53.706-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing budget'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='measuring marketing and PR'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing and PR activities'/><title type='text'>Calling all HR suppliers – the latest Trends in HR Marketing survey is ready for your valued input</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/STbEkJDbpBI/AAAAAAAAAlk/YpzKLoSdmAw/s1600-h/hrm_jan2007_thumbs.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 96px; height: 121px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/STbEkJDbpBI/AAAAAAAAAlk/YpzKLoSdmAw/s320/hrm_jan2007_thumbs.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5275620138695762962" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's that time of year again and we need your help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.qualtrics.com/SE?SID=SV_4PaxtYNUrgXDTHm&amp;amp;SVID=Prod"&gt;Trends in HR Marketing survey for suppliers&lt;/a&gt; is live and ready for your input (you may have already received an email from us).

I'm not sure if he was trying to humble us or put us at ease by suggesting that in the big scheme of life, the game wasn't a big deal. Maybe both. But whatever his motive, I don't think it made a difference, especially when he'd follow up this statement with "It's a good day to die!" (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;He was excitable&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought of my coach's statements recently in the context of the human resource marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to BLS, there are approximately 253,000 HR "managers" in the US, 49,000 HR "assistants" and 181,000 payroll and timekeeping clerks. But one has to assume that this total (483,000) under-reports the actual number of people in HR because many who are in the field and/or influence purchases of HR related products may not necessarily consider themselves HR "managers", "assistants" or "payroll" specialists (e.g., CEOs, IT, Finance, department heads, PEOs, benefit brokers, etc.). Not to mention these numbers don't fully account for public sector employment at the state and federal level.  But for arguments sake, let's assume the BLS number of 483,000 accurately reflects the total number of people in HR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the profession's largest trade association, attracts about 11,000 HR professionals to their annual event each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's about 2% of all HR people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with me - there is a point to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At HRmarketer.com, we talk to a lot of HR vendors (hundreds each quarter) and it never ceases to amaze me how many have never attended a major HR tradeshow or heard of so-called industry thought leaders/ analysts. It's even more astonishing when you travel the country and speak with HR professionals. Many have never heard of any of the major talent management vendors and a significant number couldn't name an HR analyst if their life depended on it. And believe it or not, a lot don't even belong to SHRM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does all this mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;To industry thought leaders&lt;/span&gt;, it means humility (there are a billion people in China....). The HR "establishment" consists of the same few people going to the same few events speaking to the same few people/vendors and reading the same few trades, blogs and web sites. Too many of these experts (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;they really are experts and very smart and much more knowledgeable about the space than I am&lt;/span&gt;) make broad statements and predictions that are not really representative of the HR marketplace. More often than not, their statements, predictions and viewpoints are based on what is happening in the Fortune 500 or amongst leading publicly held HR vendors - after all, this is where they get much of their revenue from. But the Fortune 500 is not always representative of what's going on in HR. In fact, many HR suppliers with revenues between 2 and 10 million in sales are well established, profitable, debt free and growing. And unheard of by much of the HR establishment. I'm really not being critical or trying to demean these experts but I do believe many suffer from the Ivory Tower Syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;To vendors&lt;/span&gt;, it means opportunity and the importance of maintaining diverse marketing programs (especially those tactics that build your online visibility) to reach what is essentially an untapped market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/consolidation-myth-in-hr-marketplace.html"&gt;Untapped&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2005, there were approximately 13 million "businesses" (non government) in the US with payroll (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;e.g., employees - there were over 30 million self-employed businesses with no employees but they don't really buy HR stuff)&lt;/span&gt;. The top 50 employers (excluding the public sector) in the US employ about 11 million people, or about 9% of all employees. The entire Fortune 500 employs about 24 million people or about 20% of all employees. The mid-market (between 500 and 2,500 employees) represents about 15% of all US employees and is growing faster than employment in the Fortune 500. If you broaden your definition of the mid market to include companies between 500 and 5,000 employees, you'll find they employ about 20% of all employees - about the same as Fortune 500 employment. In my experience, when companies get to about 100 employees, they dedicate someone to oversee human resources. And there are about 120,000 companies who employ 100 or more employees. So if you further broaden your definition of the mid market to include companies with between 100 and 5,000 employees you get about 36 million employees. And this does not even include governmental employment. Add another 5 million state employees and 2 million federal employees (they need HR products and services to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mid-market is where the growth of the HR marketplace will come from in the future.  It's &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;untapped&lt;/span&gt; and for the most part &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;unconnected to the HR establishment&lt;/span&gt;. These are the HR professionals who answer "no" to the question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Have you heard of [insert your favorite thought leader, analyst, trade show, talent management firm, etc.]?" &lt;/blockquote&gt;And the consolidation we see amongst major HR suppliers servicing the Fortune 500, is for the most part non-existent in the mid market. In the mid market, opportunities abound - for all HR suppliers, regardless of size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But reaching these companies is not always easy or cost effective because there is no single event, web site, trade magazine or mail list that gets you access to them. But I'm willing to wager that most if not all use the Internet. And this is why having a strong online visibility and executing a variety of both traditional and non traditional marketing campaigns is so critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to think about when planning your 2009 marketing and PR budgets.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/3840655984346129715/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=3840655984346129715' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/3840655984346129715?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3840655984346129715'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/billion-people-in-china-never-heard-of.html' title='A Billion People in China Never Heard of [insert your favorite Talent Management vendor or thought leader]'/><author><name>Mark Willaman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06450702741047605271</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_W8ZORKoAgcI/SSwvU4iP1DI/AAAAAAAAADQ/wmeezQewjZ4/s72-c/tapped.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-110172772402758885</id><published>2008-11-24T06:48:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-24T06:51:10.796-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-24T06:51:10.796-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='phone interviews'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='candidate screening'/><title type='text'>Pre-recorded phone interviews the easy way with VoiceScreener</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SSq_Am0ZLDI/AAAAAAAAAlU/WYSLpTCBXFI/s1600-h/voicescreener.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 59px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SSq_Am0ZLDI/AAAAAAAAAlU/WYSLpTCBXFI/s200/voicescreener.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272236330931792946" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We've worked with hundreds of HR suppliers over the years, many of whom are fortunately still in business, or were acquired, or have retooled and are coming back.  We've seen some pretty cool stuff and some not so cool stuff.  We've talked with and/or interviewed some amazing people in the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We like to be in the know – you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I was contacted by the folks at &lt;a href="http://www.harqen.com/"&gt;harQen&lt;/a&gt;, a holding company billed as "a web-telephony company" that's recently developed two new products:  &lt;a href="http://www.comicwonder.com/"&gt;Comic Wonder&lt;/a&gt; – competitive joke-telling online (love it), and &lt;a href="http://www.voicescreener.com/"&gt;VoiceScreener&lt;/a&gt;, Web-based recorded phone interviews online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strange bedfellows indeed, but of course let's talk about VoiceScreener.  I had the opportunity to experiment with the tool and have to admit it's pretty cool (unintentional rhyme).  The use of IVR technology has declined recently per my talks with ATS vendors, but we'll see how VoiceScreener holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the flood of resumes for sought after seasonal/hourly jobs in today's crappy holiday market place (and beyond).  Small employers just don't have the staff to phone screen all those candidates, much less schedule any of them.  An employer can easily set up a VoiceScreener account and create as many job campaigns as it wants.  Then you record your greeting, your screening questions and invite applicants via automated email to respond to your prerecorded phone interviews.  The management dashboard is very intuitive and I had no questions on how to set up a campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates enter their phone numbers and wallah – the VoiceScreener magic online assistant calls them to conduct the interviews and the employer can easily screen the results.  Of course it's not designed to take the place of final live interviews, but like many other types of pre-screening tools available online today, it does help you get to the short list more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't experience any hiccups when I tested it with my staff.  It's still in beta and has room to grow, but I recommend employers, hiring managers and recruiters check it out.  They even claim to be able to import applicants from any ATS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VoiceScreener is offering up to 50 HRmarketer Blog readers complimentary beta trials by going to the &lt;a href="http://www.voicescreener.com/"&gt;VoiceScreener&lt;/a&gt; site and signing up with the code HRMARKETER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a go and tell us what you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Kevin Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/110172772402758885/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=110172772402758885' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/110172772402758885?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/110172772402758885'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/pre-recorded-phone-interviews-easy-way.html' title='Pre-recorded phone interviews the easy way with VoiceScreener'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SSq_Am0ZLDI/AAAAAAAAAlU/WYSLpTCBXFI/s72-c/voicescreener.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-2104985937188553566</id><published>2008-11-23T15:18:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-23T16:16:14.675-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-23T16:16:14.675-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='jargon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing and PR'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='talent management systems'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HR Tech'/><title type='text'>The Talent Management HRchitect Beauty Pageant – Smartify that Software!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SSnyN5HZauI/AAAAAAAAAlM/n1ppUwuh8xw/s1600-h/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 151px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SSnyN5HZauI/AAAAAAAAAlM/n1ppUwuh8xw/s200/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272011159297944290" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The second &lt;a href="http://hrchitect.wordpress.com/2008/11/06/an-hrchitect-beauty-pageant/"&gt;HRchitect Beauty Pageant&lt;/a&gt; was last Friday and it was again a pleasure to attend.  &lt;a href="http://www.hrchitect.com/"&gt;HRchitect&lt;/a&gt; has a great gig going on with these pageants, giving top HR suppliers the opportunity to pitch their wares in 7-8 minutes to a crowed of potential buyers, competitors, investors, movers, shakers and other industry folk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest pageant was all about talent management, a nice segue from &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-hrchitect-beauty-pageant.html"&gt;last week's talent acquisition pageant&lt;/a&gt;.  The players were &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/profile.php?pid=477"&gt;Halogen&lt;/a&gt;, Plateau Systems, Salary.com, &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/profile.php?pid=1321"&gt;Cornerstone OnDemand&lt;/a&gt; and Workscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like last week, I listened to each presentation with primarily a marketing ear, but also as a potential buyer.  Overall the presentations were better than the TA crowd – but still enough &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/06/lost-in-translation.html"&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll come back to that.  The takeaway themes for me were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How TM vendors are really trying to develop integrated end-to-end solutions sans the recruitment module.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging the current economic situation and the workplace realities/pressures of their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Off-the-shelve/on-premise vs. SaaS solutions – SaaS is the winner (sorry, &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/09/end-of-saas-yes-says-lawsons-ceo.html"&gt;Lawson&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longevity.  Will they be around in 5-10 years?  Most of them have already been around for around 10 years and weathered the 2001-2003 bust, but this is a different story.  (More on that when I blog about my recent interview with &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/profile.php?pid=899"&gt;nowHIRE&lt;/a&gt; president, Joseph Impastato.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smartifying the software.  Really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there's the money shot – smartify.  Love it.  Now stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that the presentations static and dry sometimes, like they were presenting to an internal team.  Only Authoria last week incorporated a live demo.  Nobody did this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner for me – and the rest of the crowd – was Cornerstone OnDemand.  Nice work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their product marketing theme of "Connect, Develop, Perform" was dynamic and really hit the pain points of potential buyers.  The presentation was very conversational, but the big score for me, and what differentiated them the most, was their emphasis on workplace social networking for talent management – onboarding, shared training/learning, performance support, internal recruiting, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refreshing and well done.  Time for turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Thanksgiving everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Kevin Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/2104985937188553566/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=2104985937188553566' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/2104985937188553566?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2104985937188553566'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/talent-management-hrchitect-beauty.html' title='The Talent Management HRchitect Beauty Pageant – Smartify that Software!'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SSnyN5HZauI/AAAAAAAAAlM/n1ppUwuh8xw/s72-c/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-4406898568269468018</id><published>2008-11-19T21:23:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-19T22:04:55.209-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-19T22:04:55.209-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='employeescreenIQ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='candidate screening'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ERE Expo'/><title type='text'>Podcast: Nick Fishman of employeescreenIQ</title><content type='html'>While at the recent &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/ere-expo-fall-2008-will-get-through.html"&gt;Fall  ERE Expo&lt;/a&gt; I sat down with Nick Fishman, Chief Marketing Officer of &lt;a href="http://www.employeescreen.com/"&gt;employeescreenIQ&lt;/a&gt;, a global background screening company, for a quick interview recorded live on the exhibition hall floor.

And the Importance of Marketing.</title><content type='html'>Bill Kutik wrote a very good article in HRE Online this week titled &lt;a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=146634320"&gt;Recruiting Software Goes Berserk -- Again!&lt;/a&gt; Bill  says "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;After seeming to settle down and consolidate for a while, recruiting software has once again become the most competitive, contentious and confused sector in all of HR technology. Why? Because they still haven't gotten it right!&lt;/span&gt;".  (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" &gt;Please read the entire article - it's a good read)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with Bill that the recruiting software space is highly competitive - but so is just about every other product category in HR, from employee benefits to training &amp;amp; development. But on a macro level, I have never seen the consolidation that many experts predicted in the HR technology space. As far back as 2005 we blogged about what we felt was the consolidation myth in the HR space and how the number of HR vendors would continue to grow, not decline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did we know this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the owners of &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/index.htm"&gt;HRmarketer.com&lt;/a&gt;, we have the opportunity to speak with hundreds of HR vendors each quarter and a lot of these businesses are start-ups who purchase HRmarketer.com memberships months before they launch their product(s) to help familiarize themselves with the space and prepare their marketing plans.   And &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;for every HR vendor that was acquired or closed their doors, we were seeing at least two companies open their doors&lt;/span&gt; as new entrants in the HR marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say the reason is because "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;we still haven't gotten it right&lt;/span&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree. There is a lot more to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In competitive markets, one never gets it right because of a concept called innovation. There is always some young mind (or veteran mind like Dave Duffield) working on a new and better way of doing something. It never stops.  The technologies did not exist five years ago that make it possible for many of today's offerings. And we'll say the same thing ten years from now.  But innovation does go in cycles and the last 7 years have presented the perfect storm of opportunity for HR start-ups including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Easier access to technology&lt;/span&gt; (a.k.a. decreased entry barriers). What would have cost millions to build ten years ago can be built today for a fraction of that - and be a better application. (&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Incidentally, this is why legacy providers like &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/09/end-of-saas-yes-says-lawsons-ceo.html"&gt;Lawson are going to have a tough time competing the next ten years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Growing need for quality HR services&lt;/span&gt; and recognition of HR as a strategic component of the business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) (at least up until a few months ago) &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Easy and low cost of capital&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is why in just about every industry and profession, we were seeing more, not less. Innovation combined with the right market conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Calacanis had an excellent post that touched upon some of these reasons titled &lt;a href="http://calacanis.com/2008/11/06/the-future-of-startups/"&gt;The Future of Startups&lt;/a&gt; (long but EXCELLENT).  I especially like his thoughts on The Zero Cost Start Up, The Try Everything Era and Longevity is Innovative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does all this mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Competition in the HR marketplace will only get more intense in the coming years. On a macro level, there will be no consolidation for quite some time because as &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/07/taleo-and-vurv-some-thoughts-as-more.html"&gt;I wrote back in July&lt;/a&gt;, this is still a young industry in historical terms - the profitable and vast "mid market" is untapped and smaller talent management firms are on more equal footing when competing in this space. In fact, one could argue they are on better footing because they don't have the cost structure and legacy platforms to contend with like their larger competitors do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will differentiate many of the HR vendors is ------------------ &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;marketing&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"....marketing is the foundation for success. Companies who use marketing as the basis for strategy are likely to acquire leadership faster and with less risk".  &lt;/blockquote&gt;By the way, those aren't my words, they belong to Peter Drucker :-)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/2791364375234878403/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=2791364375234878403' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/2791364375234878403?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2791364375234878403'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/consolidation-myth-in-hr-marketplace.html' title='The Consolidation Myth in the HR Marketplace.

Companies like Wal-Mart and Dell become industry titans in part by tackling the false choice between offering products of low-cost and products of high-quality. Companies such Ikea and Target dispel the notion that the best product designers can't produce for the masses. The notion that a beer can't both taste great and be less filling... well, you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.qualtrics.com/#"&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/a&gt;, a company which describes itself as "a market leader in Internet-based, electronic survey creation, analysis and distribution" has developed a survey tool sophisticated enough for a Ph.D and simple enough to use for an intern. Great research capability is now accessible to anyone who wants to reach out and get it (and buy it of course!).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lowering the barriers of entry to create great research is one of the many promises of the Qualtrics research suite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I interviewed Ryan Smith, Director at Qualtrics several weeks ago about their research suite, his view of the survey tools marketplace, and the use of data in organizational decision-making. Here's an edited summary of our discussion:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s your view of the survey tool market?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan&lt;/em&gt;: There are two sides of the spectrum. The get-in and get-out low-cost solutions and then the high-end tools. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Qualtrics addresses the high-end, supporting the most demanding customers. Low-end tools limit research capability and data-collection. Sophisticated users in academic and research institutions will not use a tool that has limitations. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Though Qualtrics can address both ends of the market by serving those who require depth of functionality and those who need something easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We aim to lower the barriers to entry to great research with the ability to scale-up to meet the needs of the most demanding researchers. For example, one research university has 1,500 users and has required no training.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many have jumped off the low-end solutions to Qualtrics and won’t go back to the lower end tools. They've discovered that there is tremendous value in research done well and the decision making it supports. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Describe your market and your customer base.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan&lt;/em&gt;: While we work with most of the leading universities in the US, the majority of Qualtrics customers are corporate, comprising 15-20% of the Fortune 500. Qualtrics has about 30,000 active users. Within the corporate segment, internal functions using the research suite are Human Resources, Marketing, and all the way through the organization up to the Boards of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To what degree can you help with survey and content development?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan&lt;/em&gt;: The number one problem people have with survey development is the answer portion. Most people don’t have an issue coming up with logical questions. It’s offering the answers that causes hesitation. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Qualtrics provides a library of questions complete with different types of responses. For those who license Qualtrics for their organization, you can even build an internal knowledge-base, so that when people transition into new roles or move around the organization the history and knowledge-base stays intact and ready to build upon. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Professional services is available to help develop the survey, it’s metrics, flow, and overall design.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest impacts that Qualtrics has is to improve survey response rates: from the way the survey is presented, the way it flows, and is supported by the software itself and through the consultative support Qualtrics provides.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s your view of decision making capability within organizations today?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan&lt;/em&gt;: You need to use data to make decisions, if not you’re using opinions. As one CEO says, “If you’ve got data, we’ll use data, if you’ve opinions, we’ll use mine!”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Leading companies such as Google and Microsoft use data, not just stats, to help make every decision.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Qualtrics helps companies bridge the all-important gap, to understand not only “what” but “why” something happens. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;One example: an NBA team surveyed game attendees to determine how they experienced noise levels in the arena. By using Qualtrics, they were able to tie responses to where the fans sat in the arena. They discovered not only that the arena is too loud but alos &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; it's too loud. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Overall, huge opportunity exists as the research use within organizations is still sporadic. Qualtrics has a vision where data capture is embedded in processes and across Web sites and always available, and all management sees is the data.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you see research developing as a core capability and essential skill for all organizations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan&lt;/em&gt;: Yes, in order to compete, you've got to do research. Otherwise, you're just throwing mud at the wall. In areas of product development and innovation, people think they know, but their too close to their own products. At Qualtrics, we use our own tool to test new ideas with existing customers. We learn every time we send a survey something new and valuable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ryan let me know that they've got plans to further support Human Resources professionals with new modules and resources, joining dedicated measurement tools in the HR space such as &lt;a href="http://www.improvedexperience.com/"&gt;Improved Experience&lt;/a&gt; and other leading feedback management tools like &lt;a href="http://www.beelinersurveys.com/"&gt;Beeliner Surveys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/1420017872111500852/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=1420017872111500852' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/1420017872111500852?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1420017872111500852'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/qualtrics-lowering-barriers-to-great.html' title='Qualtrics: Lowering the Barriers to Great Research'/><author><name>Jonathan Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15113478704220157813</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TpOhLB7IsgI/SSJBlELscPI/AAAAAAAABBs/ecWUMTTlcbc/s72-c/Qualtrics-(stacked-red).png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-489654374944016151</id><published>2008-11-14T15:42:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-14T15:45:11.513-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-14T15:45:11.513-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='jargon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing and PR'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='talent acquisition systems'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HR Tech'/><title type='text'>The First HRchitect Beauty Pageant – globalability what?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SR4NLynI7iI/AAAAAAAAAlE/YKyWVue6OYc/s1600-h/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 151px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SR4NLynI7iI/AAAAAAAAAlE/YKyWVue6OYc/s200/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268663110285717026" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I attended the first &lt;a href="http://hrchitect.wordpress.com/2008/11/06/an-hrchitect-beauty-pageant/"&gt;HRchitect Beauty Pageant&lt;/a&gt; today that was all about talent acquisition systems.  &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/showing-some-skin-at-first-hr.html"&gt;We blogged about it last week&lt;/a&gt; and received some interesting commentary as well (see comments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudos to HRchitect for making it happen!  There were only a few minor technical bumps and otherwise was a fine event with brief but comprehensive presentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you keeping score at home, these pageants are a series of 90-minute webinars where up to six vendors will compete for the votes from an estimated 200 HR professionals in attendance.  They're hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.hrchitect.com/"&gt;HRchitect&lt;/a&gt;, an HR technology consulting firm that helps companies select the right technology for their HR and talent management needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participating vendor has about 7 minutes to show their stuff:  Evening Gown, Swimsuit, Talent, and Interview sections.  In this first one today – Authoria, Silkroad, ADP VirtualEdge, MrTed and iCIMS – all competed in the talent acquisition system pageant.  I was expecting some cool creative things today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to each presentation with primarily a marketing ear, but also as a potential buyer.  I'm sure all the vendors in the pageant have quality TA solutions for their respective markets, but man, what's with the &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/06/lost-in-translation.html"&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egads.  I won't call anybody out in particular, but overall I thought the sales pitches just weren't very good.  Before I tell you who I thought won though, and who really did win, let's discuss the word globalability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell is that?  Do HR and executive management use terms like that?  This and many others were pervasive in the presentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even though each vendor made their own case for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User collaboration (HR, recruiters and hiring managers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streamlining workflow processes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suites of compatible and/or stand-alone modules&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving the applicant experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Globalability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of them lacked clarity and marketing creativity.  The workflow productivity improvement solutions were confusing; I'd sooner stick with mailroom couriers for HR, recruiters and hiring managers (think &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093936/"&gt;Secret of My Success&lt;/a&gt;), and spreadsheets for tracking applicants and employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Authoria was strong with their live product demonstration and iCIMS (who won) gave a clear albeit not very creative presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my money, Silkroad had the strongest pitch based on clear messaging, scope of solutions/modules, little jargon and a very creative, engaging presentation.  I'd give them a test drive if I was in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to more HRchitect Beauty Pageants.  This is good for a noisy, ever-increasingly commoditized and competitive (and somewhat anemic) talent management marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now step it up, folks, 'cause I'll be watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q7FFjUpVLg"&gt;Bump, bump – oh yeah – chick-a-chick-ahhhhhhhhhh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Kevin Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/489654374944016151/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=489654374944016151' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/489654374944016151?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/489654374944016151'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-hrchitect-beauty-pageant.html' title='The First HRchitect Beauty Pageant – globalability what?'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SR4NLynI7iI/AAAAAAAAAlE/YKyWVue6OYc/s72-c/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-1249119182917163429</id><published>2008-11-13T14:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-13T15:04:39.732-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-13T15:04:39.732-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='hrmarketer'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='seo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='direct marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='economic downturn'/><title type='text'>HRmarketer Offering a Marketing Bailout Plan for HR Vendors</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W8ZORKoAgcI/SRyxzMrz2eI/AAAAAAAAADI/7JPrSkWhALE/s1600-h/HangInThere.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 224px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W8ZORKoAgcI/SRyxzMrz2eI/AAAAAAAAADI/7JPrSkWhALE/s320/HangInThere.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268281157253061090" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I just don't have the cash flow at the moment but I need sales leads. Can you work with me?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tough economy. Worse than the dot com collapse in the late 1990s. Much worse. I know because I launched a new business (Fisher Vista, LLC) in 2000 and while business was bad here in Silicon Valley, it was still going well in other parts of the Country. This business slowdown is not only coast-to-coast, it's global. But hang in there. It will get better. It always does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, maybe HRmarketer can help so that you don’t &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;do something foolish like suspend your marketing&lt;/span&gt;. In tough economic times, the gut instinct is to slash the marketing budget but it's a huge mistake.  Marketing cannot be stopped and started because there is a lag time between campaigns and sales. Suspending marketing creates serious gaps in your prospect pipeline – something you can't just kick-start when good times return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we've announced a “reverse lay-away” program of sorts that will help HR suppliers continue their critical (as in lead generating) marketing activities during these challenging times. We're allowing qualified vendors to pay interest-free monthly installments over a 12-month period for many of our most effective lead-generating services, including direct e-mail list rental campaigns, web site and SEO work, white paper development and HRmarketer.com memberships. This is not the dreaded "credit" word as there is no interest. We're simply giving HR vendors flexible payment options. As an example, a supplier who invests in a &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_whatwedo.htm"&gt;direct marketing campaign&lt;/a&gt; can pay for the campaign over a one-year period with small monthly payments while they realize revenue from the campaign’s leads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've enjoyed nearly ten years of growing revenue and are fortunate to be in a healthy cash position, enabling us to assist our valued customers (the ones who have supported us over the years) in maintaining their most critical marketing activities during this tough economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the right thing to do and it makes good business sense for both parties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in learning more just give us a call at 831-685-9700 or send us an email at sales (at) hrmarketer.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as always, we thank our customers. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;You're the best&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Willaman&lt;br /&gt;Founder and President&lt;br /&gt;Fisher Vista, LLC&lt;br /&gt;mwillaman (at) hrmarketer.com</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/1249119182917163429/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=1249119182917163429' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/1249119182917163429?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1249119182917163429'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/hrmarketer-offering-marketing-bailout.html' title='HRmarketer Offering a Marketing Bailout Plan for HR Vendors'/><author><name>Mark Willaman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06450702741047605271</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W8ZORKoAgcI/SRyxzMrz2eI/AAAAAAAAADI/7JPrSkWhALE/s72-c/HangInThere.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-426993600638778481</id><published>2008-11-11T19:14:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-11T19:22:14.243-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-11T19:22:14.243-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='jargon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HR suppliers'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='search-optimized release'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='public relations'/><title type='text'>Getting Your PR Program Off the Ground</title><content type='html'>&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRmarketer's public relations team recently emerged from its bunker to host a webinar titled &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/webinars09252008.htm"&gt;PR 101: Get Your PR Program off the Ground&lt;/a&gt;. It's now available at HRmarketer.com for both attendees and the public, via the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/webinars09252008.htm"&gt;http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/webinars09252008.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yours truly, along with fellow PR professional Gail DeLano, talked over the basic components of planning and executing a solid PR program. Highlights included determining your key audiences, targeting the proper media outlets, the importance of reading trade publications, and the benefits of a concise and newsworthy press release (no, they're not dead).  Other topics featured analyst relations, editorial calendars, pitching stories, and search-optimized press releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five years of working with HRmarketer clients, I've assisted those who either: A) wore many hats and didn't have the time to do PR properly; B) had no training, yet drew "the short straw;" or C) simply didn't know where to begin. Our advance audience poll validated that most HR / benefits suppliers find themselves in one of these scenarios, with lack of time the biggest cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a bit scary to read that Gail and I have 40-plus years of combined PR experience—we must have been 15 when we started our careers! Attendees seemed eager for the insight, because after a 50-minute presentation the webinar shifted into Q&amp;amp;A mode and continued another 30 minutes. Questions ranged from whether press releases really matter to getting more mileage out of bylined articles, and from pitching broadcast media to starting a blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With such a crowded marketplace, there's only so much coverage that the HR media can offer. Being creative and building relationships are the keys to getting noticed. If attendees walked away with only three messages from the webinar, I'd hope they were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read those trade publications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know what makes your business unique among competitors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate jargon—be a storyteller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full webinar, visit &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/webinars09252008.htm"&gt;http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/webinars09252008.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final note: logistics caused me to present from my home office in Salinas, California, one day before the city's annual air show. So when you play the webinar, be sure to listen for the earth-shaking arrival of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds. Given our program title, we couldn't have asked for a better soundtrack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Elrond Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/426993600638778481/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=426993600638778481' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/426993600638778481?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/426993600638778481'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/getting-your-pr-program-off-ground.html' title='Getting Your PR Program Off the Ground'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-5775919188158698394</id><published>2008-11-10T16:17:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-10T16:32:17.767-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-10T16:32:17.767-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='content development'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing and PR'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media relations'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media coverage'/><title type='text'>JobApp Network Earns Great Media Coverage by Leading with Original Content</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.jobappnetwork.com/diversity3/"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; width: 200px; cursor: pointer; height: 200px;" alt="" src="http://www.prweb.com/prfiles/2008/11/05/1577964/gI_0_0_.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anyone who reads this blog, or talks to any member of the team here at HRmarketer, will hear over and over that “Content is King”. HR professionals love tools that will help them do their jobs better, save the company money, help make the case for why they should implement “X” program, software, etc.   &lt;p&gt;As an HR supplier, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; know your business, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have insight that others may not have even considered, and &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; know cost savings companies experience when they use your product or service. The simple idea is to use that expertise, thought leadership, data and analysis to promote your company as an industry leader and as a company HR professionals should consider doing business with. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A perfect example of such content is a research report put out by &lt;a href="http://www.jobappnetwork.com/"&gt;JobApp Network&lt;/a&gt;, provider of phone and web-based hiring management solutions. This report was featured in &lt;a href="http://www.diversity-executive.com/article.php?article=131"&gt;Diversity Executive&lt;/a&gt; magazine and on the popular New York Times blog &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/the-adverse-impact-of-web-based-hiring-on-minorities/"&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;. These are two great earned media placements, one industry-specific and one general business/interest. JobApp Network also recently &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/11/prweb1577964.htm"&gt;announced via the availability of the report via a press release&lt;/a&gt; (sent via HRmarketer.com). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What was so interesting about this research? For the report “&lt;a href="http://www.jobappnetwork.com/diversity3"&gt;Automated Hiring Solutions and Diversity&lt;/a&gt;”, JobApp Network analyzed data from their clients hiring hourly employees and discovered that providing web-based only hiring management systems may exclude certain applicant populations. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The study suggests that companies who offer both web and phone based hiring solutions experience a more diverse pool of applicants. In analyzing the data they discovered that there are many people out there who do not have regular Internet access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This conclusion may come as a surprise to those who have email coming into their phones day and night, who read blogs, connect with friends online and basically use the web and email every day for both work and personal use. For companies hiring hourly employees this is without a doubt enlightening information and something for them to consider as they evaluate their hiring process and how they go about finding, sourcing and screening the best candidates. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, what expertise or insight do you have to offer your clients and potential clients? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are you using it to help educate and draw in potential new customers? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If not, you’re missing out on a powerful way to promote your business, increase traffic to your site and generate sales leads!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Post by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/profile.php?pid=952"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Jocelyn Goodman Cook&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/5775919188158698394/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=5775919188158698394' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/5775919188158698394?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5775919188158698394'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/jopapp-network-earns-great-media.html' title='JobApp Network Earns Great Media Coverage by Leading with Original Content'/><author><name>Jonathan Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15113478704220157813</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-291791224270485353</id><published>2008-11-08T08:52:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-08T08:54:34.500-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-08T08:54:34.500-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SHRM'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HR technology'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='human resources'/><title type='text'>HR Tech and the New Administration:  Let’s Keep Hope Alive</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SRXD-IidwWI/AAAAAAAAAb4/r4VpJqTcc-M/s1600-h/obama.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 193px; height: 143px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kVBP7On28Fs/SRXD-IidwWI/AAAAAAAAAb4/r4VpJqTcc-M/s200/obama.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5266330811491008866" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_10917600"&gt;According to Washington lawyers&lt;/a&gt;, Silicon Valley needs to push the tech agenda with the yet-to-be-inaugurated Obama administration.  Because the first battle will be over the next stimulus package, "the valley needs to persuade the Obama administration that 'technology means stimulus' — that investing in energy and other initiatives will help restore the economy to health."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's with the lawyers?  Expect more regulation to be reconstituted in Washington; the market won't be given carte blanche anymore.  I was telling one of our staff the other day that I have this juxtaposed split-screen video running in my head:  on one side there's Alan Greenspan saying "I really thought the market could manage itself" and then the other side shows a roomful of kids viciously attacking a cross-bred elephant/donkey piñata full of delicious candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new wave of regulation will spill over to HR as well.  &lt;a href="http://www.shrm.org/government/update/110708_1.asp"&gt;According to SHRM&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new administration and democratic-led congress could advance the most active workplace policy agenda in the last 30 years. Within the first nine months of the new session, Democrats are likely to push legislative initiatives on such issues as a mandated card check process, paid sick leave, and enhanced gender non-discrimination in pay decisions.  In addition, with the new administration and enlarged Democratic majorities, we anticipate increased regulatory enforcement activity on issues vital to HR. For instance, an Obama administration is likely to increase rulemaking in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in order to address perceived deficiencies in workplace safety regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR technology needs to be a part of this agenda and "the other initiatives" in order to help fix the economy.  No matter how deep the recession and how high the unemployment rate gets, private and public institutions alike need to manage, regulate and improve their workforces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's keep hope alive.

But I can't. Kudos to &lt;a href="http://www.hrchitect.com/_mgxroot/page_hrchitect_overview_leadership_team_tiffany_appleby__director_of_marketing.html"&gt;Tiffany Appleby &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.hrchitect.com/_mgxroot/page_hrchitect_overview_leadership_team_matt_lafata__vicepresident_sales__marketing.html"&gt;Matt Lafata&lt;/a&gt; at HRchitect' for coming up and executing this idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HRchitect, an HR technology consulting firm that helps companies select the right technology for their HR and talent management needs, is hosting a series of 90-minute webinars where six vendors will compete for the votes from an estimated 200 HR professionals in attendance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What are the HR people voting on? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who has the best &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/hrsuppliers.php?sqlSEARCH=%20and%20%28users.description%20like%20%27%25Technology%25%27%20or%20users.tags%20like%20%27%25Technology%25%27%20or%20users.activity_description%20like%20%27%25Technology%25%27%20or%20users.company%20like%20%27%25Technology%25%27%20or%20users.name%20like%20%27%25Technology%25%27%29"&gt;HR technology&lt;/a&gt; solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What is the schedule of Webinars?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(all times are 11am CST)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 14: Talent Acquisition Systems&lt;br /&gt;November 21: Talent Management Systems&lt;br /&gt;December 12: Human Resource Information Systems&lt;br /&gt;December 19: Learning Management Systems&lt;br /&gt;January 9: Mid-market ATS&lt;br /&gt;January 16: Onboarding&lt;br /&gt;January 23: Employee Performance Management&lt;br /&gt;February 6: Mid-market HRIS&lt;br /&gt;February 13: Time &amp;amp; Attendance Systems&lt;br /&gt;February 20: Workforce Planning&lt;br /&gt;March 13: Compensation Management&lt;br /&gt;March 20: Succession Planning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What HR Technology vendors will compete?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HRchitect publishes many reports on what they believe to be the top HR technology vendors. They reached out to the top vendors in each category above to participate in these Beauty Pageants. Some declined. Ultimately, about 6 vendors were selected per category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Why Beauty Pageants?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the theme for these 90 minute webcasts where each of the 6 vendors (contestants) have 7 minutes to strut their stuff. Here is the agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opening Ceremonies: Intro by HRchitect and overview of the marketplace. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evening Gown: The formalities. Contestants give their corporate overview, list of marque clients, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swimsuit: The Wow factor. Contestants discuss their technology, usability and show some skin (screenshots).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talent:  Contestants discuss their technology's functionality, integration, features, etc. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interview: The audience (HR professionals) asks questions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vote: HR people vote and the winner is crowned. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I bet HRchitect had a lot of fun working on this project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good "content". Good marketing.  Good visibility. Good leads. Good fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hrchitect.wordpress.com/2008/11/06/an-hrchitect-beauty-pageant/"&gt;More details here&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/1742692738153736358/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=1742692738153736358' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/1742692738153736358?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1742692738153736358'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/showing-some-skin-at-first-hr.html' title='Showing Some Skin at the First HR Technology Beauty Pageant'/><author><name>Mark Willaman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06450702741047605271</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W8ZORKoAgcI/SRNnvvraqKI/AAAAAAAAADA/-YmkI7zup4M/s72-c/beauty-queen-for-promo-small.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-4961212874835850391</id><published>2008-11-05T07:04:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-05T07:10:26.031-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-05T07:10:26.031-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HRmarketer.com'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='seniorcaremarketer.com'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='account management'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sales'/><title type='text'>Rita Jackson joins HRmarketer.com</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TpOhLB7IsgI/SRG2gvOg0FI/AAAAAAAAAx0/L-d_NqCoQQo/s1600-h/Rita+Jackson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 125px; height: 125px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TpOhLB7IsgI/SRG2gvOg0FI/AAAAAAAAAx0/L-d_NqCoQQo/s320/Rita+Jackson.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265190112922226770" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita Jackson joined the HRmarketer sales and account management team this week as our new sales director. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to have Rita on our team!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of you know Rita from her five years with HR.com, the HRmarketer.com partner, Web site and online community serving HR professionals and executives where she both led a sales team and managed major and enterprise-level accounts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She's widely regarded as a superb relationship-builder and has a record of great customer service and demonstrable industry expertise.

They gave survival advice to start-ups — tactics for cutting costs and raising money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/"&gt;Mahalo&lt;/a&gt;'s Jason Calacanis was quoted as saying, "This is no ordinary business cycle. This is a crisis. My prediction is that Google will lay off people. And that's when we'll know we've hit the bottom."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crap.  So we haven't hit bottom yet according to these guys.  And yet, there are still many bright spots across industries, including the &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/10/hr-tech-expo-hall-day-2-t-rex-rocked.html"&gt;HR marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.  You've heard us say &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/09/dont-think-content-matters-one-example.html"&gt;content is king&lt;/a&gt;, and it is when it comes to marketing and PR, but right now cash is king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment folk at "RecessionBeat" shared some helpful survival tips for companies – all of which are applicable to HR suppliers that aren't profitable and/or seeking investment whether you're a start-up or not:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash is king.&lt;/strong&gt; Companies that don't have at least a year to 18 months of operating cash should cut staff and/or seek a bridge loan from original investors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act now.&lt;/strong&gt; VC John Doerr and others urged entrepreneurs to move swiftly, whether seeking a loan or cutting staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect the vital core.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a scalpel, not an ax, on the business, Doerr advised, and cut deeply, but just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is negotiable.&lt;/strong&gt; Angel investor Ron Conway recalled renegotiating rents for start-ups during the dot-com bust. Offer equity as a form of payment to preserve cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsource and open source.&lt;/strong&gt; Move some engineering functions overseas. Some office functions can be handled cheaply on Web-based services like Google Docs.  (And if you're cutting marketing and PR budgets, look to outsource to firms like &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_whatwedo.htm"&gt;HRmarketer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make more money.&lt;/strong&gt; The focus must shift to growing revenue from growing market share.  (Develop new revenue channels and sell, sell, sell.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-communicate.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep employees, investors, partners and customers informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be open to M&amp;amp;A. &lt;/strong&gt;Being bought may be the best option for a start-up with good technology and talent that has a struggling business model.

The unusually cool weather that overtook South Florida on Tuesday this week served to underscore the "chill" in the markets and its effect on the recruitment industry. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, the few days of professional development, networking, and deal-making became part pep-rally, group therapy session, reality-check, and opportunity spotting for the mix of professional and corporate recruiters, recruiting thought-leaders, service provides, technology vendors, and industry media.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jan Hopkins, former CNN anchor, in offering a political, economic, and cultural sweep of America summed up the sentiment underscoring the entire conference: "We will get through this." She's referring of course to the myriad of problems that have beset households, businesses, governments, and our financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ethan Bloomfield, vp of sales operations at &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ereexpo"&gt;JobTarget&lt;/a&gt; (a show sponsor and exhibitor) offered a compelling argument for increasing or at least maintaining business investment: "Either it's going to get better or the world's going to end." I personally like that strategy for conquering the fear associated with the downside risk of doubling down in a down economy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the general perception was that attendance numbers this fall were down from previous expos, ERE deserves to be commended for producing a high-quality event. I'm quite certain that the ERE Expo will continue to be among the top-tier events in this industry, and placed atop the very short list of "must attend" events for recruiters who can get a hold of the budget dollars to attend a professional development conference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here are a few bullet points from my conference session notes:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Jason Warner, Head of Staffing, Online Sales and Operations at Google:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The importance of talent is even greater in tough economic times&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Talent is available now and demand is still strong. That's good news for recruiters.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Quoting Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, "Scarcity brings clarity." Every business, business-function, and individual must understand and focus on their essential value-add in the marketplace and organization.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from Jan Hopkins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Quoting a high profile business executive, the US needs "more civil engineers, less financial engineers."&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;As a country, we've been living beyond our means and as a country we're going to relearn the values past generations had mastered, in particular those of thrift and saving.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;HR professionals and Recruiters are on the front-lines; they have an opportunity to gain leverage through this great sorting out by finding creative ways to boost morale, keep the most valuable employees, and help develop creative compensation solutions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the participants, demonstrating the "wisdom of crowds:"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Overcoming common relocation challenges associated with a down real estate market, one recruiter told how her company, in order to relocate a candidate, networked with other companies in their area found a candidate heading in the opposite direction. They found an opportunity for a "home swap."&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One company partnered with a local university to do statistical research to identify top engineering candidates who have a profile matching those most willing to relocate: post-graduate, married, non-home owners. The window of such a profile match is short so this organization works hard to find candidates while still in that sweet spot.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Those who used to lose out on MBA talent to the financial industry are now able to compete. Real industry such has the opportunity to load up on talent while Wall Street is in its downward spiral. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading of ERE Expo coverage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ere.net/2008/10/29/ere-keynoter-says-economy-offers-recruiters-seat-at-the-table/"&gt;ERE Keynoter Says Economy Offers Recruiters "Seat At The Table"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ere.net/2008/10/29/vendors-reach-recruiters-with-coffee-mugs-rockets-and-information/"&gt;Vendors Reach Recruiters With Coffee Mugs, Rockets, and Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ereexpo"&gt;The #ereexpo Twitter feed, a lively virtual exchange, complimenting the on premise action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/1488851742202398392/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=1488851742202398392' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/1488851742202398392?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1488851742202398392'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/11/ere-expo-fall-2008-will-get-through.html' title='ERE Expo Fall 2008: &amp;quot;We will get through this.&amp;quot;'/><author><name>Jonathan Goodman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15113478704220157813</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-8374736688759840619</id><published>2008-10-31T12:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-31T12:45:34.845-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-31T12:45:34.845-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='differentiation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='niche marketing'/><title type='text'>Talent Management in Family Owned Businesses. Be Different!</title><content type='html'>Talk about a Niche. We've had the wonderful pleasure of welcoming as an HRmarketer.com member a company called &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/profile.php?pid=1012"&gt;Strategic Designs for Learning (SDL)&lt;/a&gt;.  Strategic Designs For Learning assists organizations in assessing, aligning and developing talent. Specific capabilities include leadership development, executive coaching, team development, and succession - with particular expertise in working with family-owned businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's right - &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;family-owned businesses&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me naive or uninformed but until &lt;a href="http://www.strategicdesigns.net/leadership.html#frag01"&gt;Renée Montoya Lado&lt;/a&gt;,  the very impressive founder of SDL educated me, I just assumed that most family owned businesses were small and local. I could not have been more wrong. Check out these statistics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, approximately 90% of American businesses are family-owned or controlled and 60% of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. retain some level of family control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The greatest part of America's wealth lies with family-owned businesses.  Ranging in size from two-person partnerships to Fortune 500 firms, these businesses account for half of the nation's employment and half of the GNP.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;According to Renee, the family business model is unique because it incorporates three distinct and overlapping elements – the family, the ownership structure, and the business. And SDL has established a wonderful business helping family owned businesses with their talent management needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By definition, a business that focuses on a niche market is addressing a need for a product or service that is not being addressed by mainstream providers. A niche market may be thought of as a narrowly defined group of potential customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I love about SDL's niche market of  family owned businesses is it is quite large (atypical of most niche markets) and it is cross-industry.  Family-owned businesses  are equally large in just about every market segment from mining to software. This makes it relatively easy and cost-effective to target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I really love about the niche is it has some pretty big entry barriers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very niche like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you can't just re-package your TM services for family-owned businesses and expect to be taken seriously. Serving this market is about experience, credibility, trust, relationships and expertise in understanding the very unique and challenging dynamics of a family owned business - something SDL is very, very good at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many leading talent management software firms do target various industry "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;niches&lt;/span&gt;" like food services, hospitality, retail, financial services, etc.  But I would argue that the niche market (and I use the term loosely here) in these cases is the hourly worker and not so much a specific industry.   True, this "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;niche&lt;/span&gt;" is also quite large and spans across many industries but the entry barriers are not that big so competition is ferocious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very niche like.  And not that unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great niche markets are small enough for you to dominate, but big enough to be highly profitable. Or, like in the case of SDL, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;different&lt;/span&gt; enough for you to dominate and big enough to be highly profitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson here is summed up by Jack Trout, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Differentiate-Die-Survival-Killer-Competition/dp/0471028924"&gt;Differentiate or Die&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why should a customer buy your company's product instead of the 10 or so other competitive choices?

The alleged discrimination claims that women and employees over 40 years of age were treated unfairly. The plaintiffs are seeking $500 Million from Dell.  That's one big chunk of change.  According to the article, the total number of employees and former employees involved in the class action suit could number in the thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things about this lawsuit is that a Human Resources Director was one of the driving forces behind this lawsuit.  My advice:  Don't mess with your own human resources employees – they know the law, and they aren't afraid to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting tidbit: One of the plaintiffs involved has provided her own performance review to support her claims.  It seems her supervisor wrote this boneheaded comment: "You are…breaking into arguable one of the toughest old boy networks in Dell."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!  How did that one slip by the Human Resources Department?  (Hmmm, maybe it didn't…)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings to mind an ominous, but predictable outcome when the economy goes bad: an increase in employee lawsuits!   I ran across the following article describing a survey of 350 Law Firms the 2008 Litigation Trends Survey just published by international law firm Fulbright &amp;amp; Jaworski L.L.P.  Read this article &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_Oct_14/ai_n30891638/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1"&gt;A Bear Market Turns Bullish on Litigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article states: "This year's (2008) survey appears to mark an inflection point for American business, between the end of a prolonged period of prosperity and the start of a period of economic challenge that is likely to fuel litigation over who is to blame and who should pay for the consequences," said Stephen C. Dillard, who chairs Fulbright's global litigation practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked in HR for two companies that hired me AFTER a law suit hit.  (Both were discrimination lawsuits.)  One company was out of business within one year, and one lost major market share, because of the fear and recrimination as a result of the lawsuits.  Best practices in HR – now more than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Dawn Passaro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/8866236951136086107/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=8866236951136086107' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/8866236951136086107?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8866236951136086107'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/10/note-to-self-and-management-dont-cross.html' title='Note to self and management: don’t cross HR'/><author><name>Fisher Vista, LLC</name><email>info@hrmarketer.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6845367.post-1834259999788747296</id><published>2008-10-30T06:46:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-30T06:49:02.743-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-30T06:49:02.743-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='recession'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='customers come first'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='customer service'/><title type='text'>Soothe your new customer when he wails.

My wife has been reading tons of baby books, and I'm just trying to keep up with a few.  She bookmarked a little ditty for me in our latest Parenting magazine the other day and I finally read it (thank goodness she does this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span xmlns=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's titled &lt;a href="http://www.parenting.com/gear-article/Gear/-/The-Spoiled-Baby-Myth"&gt;The Spoiled Baby Myth&lt;/a&gt;.  The main theme is this:  Soothe your new baby when she wails.  Don't ignore her thinking she'll self-soothe and be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with marketing and PR and running a business?  No, I'm not sleep deprived or diaper crazy.  There is a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of you at one or another have landed a new customer who wailed every step of the way – from the closing the sale to implementation to renewal.  Nothing you do appeases them and you question why their organization signed up in the first place.  The global financial meltdowns will drive even more customers to wailing as well, wanting a lot more for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you're smart business people and you acknowledge their complaints and do everything you can to transform them into happy campers, however futile it sometimes feels.  Smaller, nimble firms are usually more adept at responding to customers who wail.  Larger companies are not and many buy into the myth that loyal (non-wailing) customers are the most valuable (&lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/10/im-avid-reader-of-marketing-books.html"&gt;mistake number two&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at what happens &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/08/but-were-not-everybody-make-all-your.html"&gt;when large companies screw up with legitimately wailing customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to say that there are illegitimate wailing customers (children, maybe – don't look at me), because every customer should be treated with respect and be acknowledged and you should always work it out for them – whatever it takes.  Don't ignore them and hope they'll go away, because they will and take their business elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark wrote earlier this year on &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/03/customer-service-and-recessions.html"&gt;Customer Service and Recessions&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. When something goes wrong, acknowledge it. If it is a result of a mistake you made, admit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Apologize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Explain what happened, how you are going to fix it, and if applicable how you will contact the customer when it is fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Leave the customer feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, number 4 is hard to do when you're dealing with wailing customers.  But from my experiences there's always someone in your organization who can appease, no matter how far up and/or across you have to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as we've said in another post about customer service, &lt;a href="http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2006/06/sorry-i-cant-help-you-with-that.html"&gt;handling customer's questions or concerns in a timely and friendly manner is vital to the long-term success of your company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aren't a nuisance; they're your business – no matter how much they wail.  And I've got super soft blankies for all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post by &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_management.htm"&gt;Kevin Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/1834259999788747296/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=1834259999788747296' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/1834259999788747296?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1834259999788747296'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/10/soothe-your-new-customer-when-he-wails.html' title='Soothe your new customer when he wails.

The reason is because &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2008/10/28/johnson__johnson_buys_provider_of_online_health_advice/"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson announced this week that it bought HealthMedia, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of online health coaching services and software to help employers reduce healthcare costs. (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" &gt;BTW, this was a very interesting purchase considering J&amp;amp;J got out of a similar business in 2003 when they sold their subsidiary Health &amp;amp; Fitness Services for about $5 million.&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ted Dacko, &lt;a href="http://www.healthmedia.com/"&gt;HealthMedia’s CEO&lt;/a&gt; and president, recently said his company, which had $23 million in revenue last year, has the potential to reach $500 million in sales and that during the last few years he has received one or two telephone calls per week from people interested in buying his company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like Ted chose a great buyer with J&amp;amp;J. Congratulations Mr. Dacko.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HealthMedia sells their online coaching services direct to employers (eBay, J&amp;amp;J, etc.) and insurance companies (BCBS plans, Aetna, etc.) who in turn either offer the program to their employer clients or direct to health plan participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Ceridian made a similar purchase when they acquired the online health coaching (and long time HRmarketer.com member) &lt;a href="http://www.ceridian.com/corp/article/1,2868,13464-63258,00.html"&gt;Leade Health&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this month, &lt;a href="http://www.gordian-health.com/"&gt;Gordian Health&lt;/a&gt; Solutions announced they had selected &lt;a href="http://www.hummingbirdcoaching.com/"&gt;Hummingbird Coaching&lt;/a&gt; (a provider of online health coaching services and another long time &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/home/about_features.htm"&gt;HRmarketer.com member&lt;/a&gt;) to be the online health coaching partner for the iCoaching program it rolled out earlier this year.  Hummingbird Coaching Services also works with Google, Motorola and United Healthcare, among others. And just this week, &lt;a href="http://www.wellsource.com/page.php"&gt;Wellsource&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of online health coaching services, announced a partnership with Health Solutions Ltd to expand it's health coaching services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like the competition in the health coaching and wellness industry is heating up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their press release, J&amp;amp;J stated that HealthMedia is the&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; base&lt;/span&gt; for their “Wellness &amp;amp; Prevention Platform.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "base"?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If history is any indication, my hunch is J&amp;amp;J is not done acquiring wellness companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a vendor in the health coaching or employee wellness space such as an &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/hrsuppliers.php?sqlSEARCH=%20and%20%28users.description%20like%20%27%25EAP%25%27%20or%20users.tags%20like%20%27%25EAP%25%27%20or%20users.activity_description%20like%20%27%25EAP%25%27%20or%20users.company%20like%20%27%25EAP%25%27%20or%20users.name%20like%20%27%25EAP%25%27%29"&gt;EAP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/hrsuppliers.php?sqlSEARCH=%20and%20%28users.description%20like%20%27%25Work%20Life%25%27%20or%20users.tags%20like%20%27%25Work%20Life%25%27%20or%20users.activity_description%20like%20%27%25Work%20Life%25%27%20or%20users.company%20like%20%27%25Work%20Life%25%27%20or%20users.name%20like%20%27%25Work%20Life%25%27%29"&gt;Work-Life&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.hrmarketer.com/site/home/community/hrsuppliers.php?sqlSEARCH=%20and%20%28users.description%20like%20%27%25wellness%25%27%20or%20users.tags%20like%20%27%25wellness%25%27%20or%20users.activity_description%20like%20%27%25wellness%25%27%20or%20users.company%20like%20%27%25wellness%25%27%20or%20users.name%20like%20%27%25wellness%25%27%29"&gt;Wellness&lt;/a&gt; company then now is the time to step up your marketing and PR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because with a big name like J&amp;amp;J getting into this space a lot of companies (e.g., JNJ competitors) and investors will be taking a fresh look at the space and this gives you the opportunity to get some good visibility with a minimal investment.  If you are easily found online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, after this announcement I went to Google and did a search for "online health coaching" and I bet a lot of other people did the same. Who shows up? Hummingbird does as a result of their regular search-optimized press releases via HRmarketer.com and the fact that their site is search-optimized. So does Gordian. But not many others do. And I counted just four sponsored links (AdWords).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see opportunity.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/4707304071797300275/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6845367&amp;postID=4707304071797300275' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6845367/posts/default/4707304071797300275?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4707304071797300275'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://hrmarketer.blogspot.com/2008/10/johnson-johnson-becomes-hr-vendor-with.html' title='Johnson &amp; Johnson Becomes an HR Vendor With Latest Acquisition'/><author><name>Mark Willaman</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06450702741047605271</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W8ZORKoAgcI/SQiPuW8YO3I/AAAAAAAAAC4/1Q_rTwkel98/s72-c/iStock_000005787803XSmall.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry></feed>
