			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Box It for Now or Later</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not big on hype, so the title of this post should mean something to you. <a href="http://www.ryankuder.com/" target="_blank">Ryan Kuder</a>, an online and off friend, pointed me to <a href="http://simplybox.com/?in=1" target="_blank">SimplyBox</a> a few days ago, and I&#8217;ve been in love in with the application ever since. This is probably the first site/product I&#8217;ve blogged about in recent memory that actually makes my life easier.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-446" title="SimplyBox plug-in" src="http://www.jennifervangrove.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/jennifer-van-grove-e280ba-create-new-post-e28094-wordpress.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="29" /></p>
<p>SimplyBox is a service that lets you capture, share, and organize anything online. Think of it as a cross between social bookmarking (a la <a href="https://secure.delicious.com/login?v=5&amp;jump=http%3A%2F%2Fdelicious.com%2Fsave%3Ftitle%3D%26notes%3D%26tags%3D%26noui%3Dno%26share%3Dyes%26jump%3Dyes%26time%3D1228875288" target="_blank">delicious</a>) and social screen capture (à la <a href="http://plasq.com/skitch" target="_blank">Skitch</a>). The beauty of SimplyBox is the browser plug-in that lets you capture and store everything while you stumble across the web.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-447" title="simplybox-think-inside-the-box" src="http://www.jennifervangrove.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/simplybox-think-inside-the-box.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="415" /></p>
<p>This is a problem-solving app for me because I&#8217;m a tab-aholic—I hate closing out tabs—I&#8217;m constantly researching various sites for blog posts, so I end up with way too many windows and way too many tabs. Yes, I could bookmark each site, but that process has never worked for me because it&#8217;s too distracting. With SimplyBox, I click &#8220;Box and Save,&#8221; create a box around content (images, text, etc) I want to remember, and then drag that saved screen grab to one of the boxes I&#8217;ve already created.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" title="SimplyBox comment" src="http://www.jennifervangrove.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/21251228862429.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="184" /></p>
<p>Once I return to view my boxed content, I can change the view of each individual box to either free form (drag and drop functionality), list view, or grid view depending on my preferences. I can also select previously saved content to either return to the source, share and comment on the individual items with friends or co-workers, print it, or save it to my computer.</p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;m quickly falling for SimplyBox, Skitch will still be the standby app I use for screen graps, simply because I can resize images on the fly. Once SimplyBox adds new functionality, and they will, I see this becoming the only thing I use for managing my manic web navigation craziness. Seriously it&#8217;s definitely worth a look.</p>
<h2>According to the CEO</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m such a huge fan of the product that I asked CEO Mario Cavagnari to answer a few questions via email. Here&#8217;s what he had to say.</p>
<h3>Q. Where did the idea come from? What was the inspiration?</h3>
<p>A. Around 05/06 we were thinking of starting a web paper that would have a very international flavor and the content would come from knowledgeable experts throughout the world, not from journalists. In early 07 we thought of a feature that would be cool for our readers - a &#8220;coffee table&#8221;, a place where the reader would be able to put the parts of our content that he/she liked. That&#8217;s when we had the &#8220;aha moment&#8221;: let&#8217;s give people a &#8220;coffee table&#8221; or a BOX where they can keep and share content from any site. I&#8217;ve always liked SimplyRed, so the name was set. From the get go we wanted the solution to be visual and easy. We felt, and feel, that is the only way to engage the masses.</p>
<h3>Q. Is there an easy way to resize images?</h3>
<p>A. Good observation. It is part of our road map and it should be done by the end of Feb.09.</p>
<h3>Q. Who do you see as SimplyBox&#8217;s primary direct competitor?</h3>
<p>A. Clipmarks. They were actually bought by Forbes in late 07. We think our user experience is much cleaner and easier. <em>(Jenn says, &#8220;I completely agree.&#8221;)</em></p>
<h3>Q. Are there any additional features you plan to roll out in the near future?</h3>
<p>A. By early 09 we will release an iPhone version that will allow the user to capture, organize, and share from the iPhone <em>(Jenn says, &#8220;I want this right now&#8221;)</em>. We are also working on a lot of enhancements for Sharing, particularly with the notion of Public Boxes (boxes that can be shared with non-SimplyBox users). We will also be integrating with Facebook and Twitter. Search, Open APIs, and more &#8230;</p>
<h3>Q. Do you have any metrics you can share? Total registered members?</h3>
<p>A. One of the metrics we were particularly interested in keeping an eye on was related to stickyness. About 1/3 of the users that sign up become regular frequent users. We have been live for approx 2 months, and out of every 100 people that visit the site 15 people sign up. Which is good news. But we need to continue to make noise and expose the solution to more people. The current conversion rates are not bad at all, but we do want to improve them. That is why part of our commercial game plan is to bring our user experience to sites that have large user bases - basically making them better. We are actually in the design/building phase of a licensing deal with a very large international portal.</p>
<h3>Q. How many people do you have your team?</h3>
<p>A. Four full time, and two contractors.</p>
<h3>Q. Is SimplyBox funded?</h3>
<p>A. Yes, by an angel. Luckly we raised money before the crisis. We are actually in a good funding position.</p>

<p>Ever wanted to look like an Elf and dance around in your own little elf music video? You could buy an elf costume and recruit your friends to film you dancing around town like a fool, or you could just <a href="http://elfyourself.jibjab.com/" target="_blank">ElfYourself</a> in a holiday-themed OfficeMax social media marketing campaign. The end result is certainly hilarious—I laughed for an eternity —but what&#8217;s the payoff for OfficeMax?</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Point?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440" title="elfyourself-by-officemax-powered-by-jibjab" src="http://www.jennifervangrove.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/elfyourself-by-officemax-powered-by-jibjab.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="409" /></p>
<p>Why did OfficeMax go to all the trouble of creating ElfYourself when the campaign itself doesn&#8217;t seem to be selling anything related to office supplies or targeting the enterprise office supply gatekeepers? Yes, you can buy and/or download the custom movie for $4.99 or buy mugs and other memorabilia with your elf-self, but I doubt that&#8217;s going to result in big holiday business for OfficeMax.</p>
<p>With all the social options made available to ElfYourself creators, is OfficeMax simply trying to increase brand awareness and make us laugh, combining positive brand associations with the viral nature of the web? That could be it, it&#8217;s certainly a lower cost, more personalized alternative than an ad buy on a large television network. It&#8217;s also positioned to be seen by a larger audience if the gimmicky social media marketing initiative wins the hearts and minds of the web savvy and attention-loving <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/09/30/the_new_me_generation/" target="_blank">Me Generation</a>.</p>
<p>As a participant in online memes, I love it. As a consumer and holiday shopper, I&#8217;m not sure what to think of the whole thing. It certainly seems to be the wrong type of word-of-mouth marketing for a company like OfficeMax. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m telling all my friends and readers that OfficeMax is the place to satisfy the office supply whore in you.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m puzzled.</p>
<p>Maybe at the end of the day they just want want my email address so they can market to me later? What do you think? What does OfficeMax get out of this equation?</p>
<p>I do make one fine little dancing elf though. <img src='http://www.jennifervangrove.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first learned about <strong>Augumented Reality</strong> (AR) when a friend of mine gave me a sneak peak at his AR startup VC-ready presentation. I was, at first, totally overwhelmed by the entire concept of AR, but once it was broken down for me, I started to realize that AR will truly shape the future of how we see the world. Wikipedia has a pretty simplistic, albeit rather bland,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">definition of AR</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Augmented reality (AR) is a field of computer research which deals with the combination of real-world and computer-generated data (virtual reality), where computer graphics objects are blended into real footage in real time.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A First Glimpse at What is to Come</h2>
<p>In a recent piece I wrote for <a href="http://www.mashable.com" target="_blank">Mashable</a>, I blogged about <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/12/04/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-google-maps/" target="_blank">how to make the most out of Google Maps</a>. In doing research for mobile tools, I found the first application that actually has me jealous of Android phones—<a href="http://mobilizy.com/wikitude.php" target="_blank">Wikitude AR Travel Guide</a>, an AR mobile app for Android.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s dead simple and yet oh so powerful. Phones with the Android OS can use their camera as a lens to see beyond the surface of the real-wold view. When you point your camera in any direction, you&#8217;ll see the actual view with a layer of Wikipedia location-based content specific to your view of the world. The video below demonstrates just how cool (and powerful) the app really is.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8EA8xlicmT8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8EA8xlicmT8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<h2>This is Going to be Huge</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning for AR. As more AR-ready devices are released to the public, you&#8217;ll begin to see a whole new view of the world—<strong>virtual data in actual life</strong>. Just image having your camera, camera phone, video device, or AR enabled sunglasses (that would be kinda neat) combine the actual world with a custom view of your already established online presence. You could be walking around seeing your social graph as an added visual layer to the phsyical world you already know and love. At the very least, AR could solve the relativley new problem of never being able to remember someone&#8217;s Twitter name. Think SecondLife, but substitute your real physical world—a true merging of your online and offline identities. Exciting&#8230;and a tad scary.</p>

I wasn&#8217;t impressed at first glance, but when I started to think about the purpose of the site—<strong>self-promotion</strong>—I thought it was at least an interesting enough idea to put out there for your feedback. Read the email (there&#8217;s a lot of unnecessary marketing jargon to sift through), check out the site, and let me and/or Dan know what you think.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p><em>Jennifer,</em></p>
<p><em>I have been reading your blog and I really enjoy your articles, and that is why I am writing you. We have recently launched a self marketing webesite that is free for users in the sales and service industry.</em></p>
<p><em>Have you ever needed that perfect some one for a certain job and didn’t know where to start looking for them? You may ask around, but if no one can refer you to someone then you usually end up opening up the phonebook or going online, you end up just looking at lists and lists of businesses. How do you choose that Insurance guy or that Realtor? Throw darts at your computer? Choose a cool sounding name? This is where MyCityFaces.com comes in!</em></p>
<p><em>MyCityFaces.com is a service industry networking and advertising site allowing people to post profiles for free, offering products they sell or a service they perform by including photos, videos, contact info and an about me section. It also allows consumers to go to their local city, choose a category, and peruse the profiles and find someone that is qualified and understands their wants and desires.</em></p>
<p><em>MyCityFaces.com was started out of the need for everyday people to advertise themselves in a personable and professional manner, and for others to find the right person for everyday needs. To help, we&#8217;ve built the premier Web service for bringing people together&#8230;Face to Face!</em></p>
<p><em>This fresh approach has not been over done, chewed up and spit out!. We are not another business networking site or a traditional directory site, we are the must &#8220;have a profile&#8221; self advertising site on the Internet today! Think of us as LinkedIn meets Myspace. We feel the service industry is often ignored and people resort to advertising themselves on social networking sites, which is not the most professional medium, and often obscures that line between business and personal. On MyCityFaces.com people can in a respectable and classy adult way, have a profile, tell about what they do, recommend others on the site and post photos, coupons, and videos. Think of it as an Internet billboard and an electronic business card. MyCityFaces.com will replace the &#8220;other&#8221; sites as the premier service industry advertising site!</em></p>
<p><em>Today there are tens of thousands of people in any city in any given occupation, we bring a personable side to finding that Handy Man, or that new Hairstylists. Finally a way to test drive before you call!</em></p>
<p><em>MyCityFaces.com is for the individual people to advertise themselves, we focus on the people that make up a business first! You can go to the site and find a hairstylists that fits your needs and you can learn a little about them before you schedule that appt. You can see what there qualifications are or just find out if you are going to see eye to eye with them. What if you are the conservative type or want a funky style you would get a lot of info from their profile. Also how many times have you found that perfect stylists only to find out they left the salon and you have no way of contacting them, and since the salon they were just at wont tell you where they went you can now return to their updated profile. They can keep a profile on mycityfaces.com and just update it with the new salons name. The same goes with any service.</em></p>
<p><em>By creating a profile with photos of you, your product, your place of business, and offering coupons, discounts, an about me section and even video, you become a real person to someone looking for your service. It&#8217;s more than just a name on an ever growing list.</em></p>
