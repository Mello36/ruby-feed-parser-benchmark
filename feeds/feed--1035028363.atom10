When deploying an in-depth technology protocol, such as WiAMX and LTE, many firms will own the intellectual property needed to create a network, from the silicon to the handsets.

A group of handset makers has <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/04/14/lte-patent-framework-planned/">banded together to create a patent framework for LTE</a>, but other key players, notably the silicon vendors are absent. ADC adds another player to that mix. Because ADC doesn't make hardware such as handsets, it doesn't have an incentive to trade its patents for the use of other patents needed for an LTE device to work. It also isn't a member of a standards organization, which WOULD limit the royalties ADC could charge. We'll see if the industry players attempt to deal with ADC or move straight to litigation. The results could mean pricier LTE handsets or even the halt of LTE- and WiMAX-enabled devices, should litigation go poorly.]]></description>

So in December 2006, in order to closely track and monitor the growth of online video, we<a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/12/04/newteevee/"> launched NewTeeVee</a>. There we have chronicled the massive influx of venture capital investment into literally hundreds of startups -- some of whom dream of being the next YouTube, others that hope to come up with the magic potion for video advertising.

In the process, Liz Gannes and Chris Albrecht have developed deep insights into the online video industry. And they have done a great job of separating the noise from the signal. Today the two of them will get on stage for our <a href="http://events.newteevee.com/live/08/">second NewTeeVee Live conference</a>, where they will talk to dozens of industry experts, insiders, movers and shakers to help guide the conversation around the future of online video. The world of video finds itself in a pretty awkward place – watching videos on the web has become as natural as sending email.

When recovering from my heart attack, I turned to Hulu to provide on-demand fun. Today, I don’t think twice about spending $20 a month on TV shows from Apple’s iTunes store or $10 for a couple of movies from Jaman. My video-watching habits, while extreme, are precisely what is scaring cable companies into taking <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/09/30/gigaom-white-paper-the-facts-fiction-of-bandwidth-caps/">the self-destructive and short-sighted approach</a> of imposing metered broadband on their customers. Phone companies are following suit.

Meanwhile, the broader economic downturn and subsequent advertising slowdown is threatening the vibrancy of this business I love so much. Layoffs have started to mar the online studios producing eclectic independent content, and a lack of advertising dollars is poised to plunder the meager treasuries of startups that are finding that the VC spigot has run dry.

But just as when you think the (online video) world is coming to an end, you have companies like Netflix, Blockbuster and others introducing devices that marry the web video to the living room experience, and in the process, inventing a whole new dynamic.

Today we will hear from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who is going to share his vision of the future, while <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/06/learn-about-the-future-of-your-living-room-at-newteevee-live/">Sling CEO Blake Krikorian is going to talk about the future of our living room</a> in a fireside chat with yours truly.

The success of Hulu has awakened the Hollywood studio system to the possibilities of online video, among them the riches that don’t need to be taxed by cable companies and other gatekeepers. With that in mind, Jason Killar, CEO of Hulu, is going to be sharing his story.

CSI creator and executive producer of the CSI franchise, Anthony Zuiker, seems to have figured out the magic formula for cross-platform storytelling and he is one of our <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/06/learn-about-the-future-of-your-living-room-at-newteevee-live/">keynote speakers</a>.

The online video industry is transitioning from being a gangly teenager to a grown-up; what remains unclear is exactly how it will evolve. I'm confident that by the end of the day we will have a better sense of what that will involve, allowing Liz, Chris and I to bring you the stories that will help all of us prepare us for this new future. <a href="http://newteeveelive-hribbon.eventbrite.com/">We hope to see you there.</a>

And if you can’t be present in person, we will be streaming the conference, thanks to the efforts of our partners, Ustream. We will also be posting to <a href="http://twitter.com/newteeveelive">NewTeeVee Live’s Twitter stream</a>, and will be live-blogging the conference <a href="http://newteevee.com">over on NewTeeVee</a>.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[President-elect Obama promised during his campaign to create a "<a href="http://obama.senate.gov/press/060727-coburn_obama_mc/">Google for government.</a>" Now that he's on his way to the White House, let's imagine what this might look like, and how such a tool could change the way people relate to those tasked with running our country. The first image this phrase brings to mind is some sort of search engine that would allow citizens to see what the government is doing, especially how it's spending money. While useful, it's not enough, as it lacks a key element: a personalized front end for government services. Think "Amazon for government," where a vast array of products and data is personalized and displayed in simplified form. <span id="more-28959"></span>Many people view the government, the federal government specifically, as a remote entity that imposes taxes and provides little tangible benefit in return. There is an opportunity here to fundamentally alter the relationship between government and citizen to be more like that of a customer and vendor.

What I would like to see is my.gov, where I can go to get a snapshot view of government services I use or for which I am eligible. By way of comparison, consider banks, most of which now offer sophisticated web services that aggregate financial data from many sources (deposit accounts, credit cards, investments, mortgage, etc.) and display them on a financial dashboard.

What would a dashboard for government look like? It could include, among, other things:
<ul>
	<li>A summary of your current social security account, projected benefits, etc. (you get one of these in the mail each year, no reason the same data can't be delivered via web)</li>
	<li>Your IRS account, including a summary of what's been paid in, contact information for your account rep, links to online filing forms, etc.</li>
	<li>Stats about recent projects funded in your vicinity, so you can see how federal funds are being spent in your area.</li>
	<li>Stats such as treasury bond yields and a current balance sheet for the government as a whole.</li>
	<li>Votes by your elected officials in Congress, compared against other districts, averages, etc.</li>
	<li>White House decisions or court rulings</li>
	<li>Support for RSS and other push/alert mechanisms</li>
</ul>
The point is that given the right tools, you could build a portal that provides you with personalized information about government services you are enrolled in and mandates and rulings that affect you by pulling in data from various systems behind the scenes. It might start out with just a few pieces of info, but could be expanded over time. The key is personalization, with an emphasis on customer service, so users visit frequently.

In the long run, the goal should be to build something that is a cross between Amazon (for viewing and managing government services) and Google (for finding and managing information, such as funded projects in your district). Whether they be average citizens or those whose job it is to track the government, the idea is to build an interface that makes government more transparent and more like a vendor or service provider, rather than a faceless abyss for taxpayer dollars

This practice of aggregating information from many sources and providing tools for personalizing a site to meet individual needs is old hat for those of us in the web industry. The Obama administration would do well to commission people from companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and others to draw up wireframes of what my.gov could be, as well as a strategy for building a first-generation version of it. My guess is that, if allowed to experiment, a skunkworks team could build an impressive site in not much time. After all, Silicon Valley's leading companies and sites were built using paltry amounts of money and on far more limited timeframes compared to federal projects (the Dept. of Homeland Security, for example).

The most important benefit of such a system, apart from improving accessibility and customer service, would be to recast the relationship between taxpayer and government. If the user can see direct relationships between taxes paid in, and services provided or benefits delivered to his or her community, it will become clear that government is not as wasteful as it may first seem, and that it does many things that most people are unaware of.

I think we're entering a period of great change, one comparable to that of FDR. It would be a great thing if we could apply what we've learned from the past decade in web commerce to build similar interfaces for government services and statistics. The result for us as taxpayers -- more transparency and better service -- would be a win for everyone involved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the years we have seen the gradual separation of phone numbers from geographical location. To date, Skype's SkypeIn service has been the best demonstration of this trend; even though I live and work just outside Toronto, Canada, I have a Palo Alto, Calif., SkypeIn number for historical family reasons, and I recently acquired a San Francisco number for Truphone. The same separation can apply to most VoIP-based voice services.

Over the past couple of years <a title="Voxbone" href="http://www.voxbone.com/" target="_blank">Belgian-based Voxbone</a> has also developed an international numbering service which offers its clients a "local" phone numbers in any of 5,000 cities in 45 countries. <a title="OnState Website" href="http://www.on-state.com/" target="_blank">OnState</a> has used Voxbone's "local" numbers as access points to its <a title="OnState Call Center" href="http://www.on-state.com/call-center.html" target="_blank">virtual call center service</a>; its clients' businesses can offer customer service and support centers with worldwide "local" access. However, it would be even more convenient for businesses selling into multiple countries if they could simply offer one universal number worldwide. Now, they can. <span id="more-28885"></span>

Yesterday, three months after the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) made available the +883 "global" country code, <a title="Voxbone iNum Press Release" href="http://www.voxbone.com/press_release.jsf;jsessionid=163BFA8441DF4149A159A82843AFEC06.bebr1web21?newsID=207" target="_blank">Voxbone announced the launch of its country-agnostic iNum service</a>. I first learned of Voxbone at <a title="Voxbone eComm 2008" href="http://ecommconf.com/2008/inum-new-numbers.php" target="_blank">last spring's eComm 2008</a> where Voxbone CEO Rod Ullens first mentioned the iNum concept. This announcement starts to realize his vision of enabling low cost conversations with worldwide access by taking advantage of the technology around IP-based communications:
<blockquote>“iNum is a new kind of phone number for a new kind of world — a world with a new geography that’s about local presence and global relationships, not about distance or national borders,” said Rodrigue Ullens, CEO and co-founder of Voxbone. “We believe the new geography is defined by the markets, customers and vendors that businesses need to connect with most. We need ‘local’ communication with these people — whether calls originate on public-switched or VoIP networks, whether they are truly local or ‘virtually’ local.”</blockquote>
In practice, that means a Voxbone <a title="Voxbone SP Partners" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">iNum Service Provider Partner</a> will supply a customer, whether an individual or a business, with a number that has an 883 country code. Once the service is fully rolled out to Voxbone's 5,000 local points of presence worldwide, that iNum number will be accessible for, at most, the cost of a "local" phone call from any PSTN or VoIP service.

"At most," because fundamental to Voxbone's services is that they are IP-based and therefore calls amongst iNum Partners' services are free. Currently Voxbone has <a title="iNum Service Provider Partners" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">10 iNum Service Provider Partners</a>, including <a title="Truphone Anywhere" href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/05/28/voxbone-powers-truphone-anywhere/" target="_blank">Truphone</a>, <a title="Mobivox Overview" href="http://skypejournal.com/2008/08/catching-up-mobivox-launching-voice.html" target="_blank">Mobivox</a> and <a title="Voxeo Overview" href="http://skypejournal.com/2008/08/voxeo-textbook-case-for-voice-20-and.html" target="_blank">Voxeo</a>, who either <a title="Voxeo's iNum Services" href="http://blogs.voxeo.com/voxeotalks/2008/11/11/how-to-get-an-inum-a-global-phone-number/" target="_blank">have made iNum numbers available today</a> or will do so in the next few weeks. (For those callers who don't use an iNum partner's service, iNum numbers can be called through 55 <a title="iNum Local Access Points" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">"local" access points in 45 countries</a> for the cost of a call to these access points.) Ullens, <a title="iNum SquawkBox Conference Call" href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/11/12/squawk-box-november-11-inum/" target="_blank">in a SquawkBox conference call yesterday</a>, said that Voxbone will be negotiating with carriers and service providers worldwide to build out their service to become universally available.

Voxeo has set up a demonstration iNum service example; call +883 510 001 800 <em>028 </em><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">024</span>, give their virtual operator a U.S. postal code and you will get local weather reports. This call can be made via the iNum Partners' services today; it will become available via the local access points as they are set up over the next week. Another example: iotum's <a title="Calliflower WWD Post Nov. 12, 2008" href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/11/12/calliflower-a-complete-conference-calling-service/" target="_blank">Callflower Conference Call service will be using iNum numbers</a> in a few days.

<p>Yesterday, three months after the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) made available the +883 &#8220;global&#8221; country code, <a title="Voxbone iNum Press Release" href="http://www.voxbone.com/press_release.jsf;jsessionid=163BFA8441DF4149A159A82843AFEC06.bebr1web21?newsID=207" target="_blank">Voxbone announced the launch of its country-agnostic iNum service</a>. I first learned of Voxbone at <a title="Voxbone eComm 2008" href="http://ecommconf.com/2008/inum-new-numbers.php" target="_blank">last spring&#8217;s eComm 2008</a> where Voxbone CEO Rod Ullens first mentioned the iNum concept. This announcement starts to realize his vision of enabling low cost conversations with worldwide access by taking advantage of the technology around IP-based communications:</p>
<blockquote><p>“iNum is a new kind of phone number for a new kind of world — a world with a new geography that’s about local presence and global relationships, not about distance or national borders,” said Rodrigue Ullens, CEO and co-founder of Voxbone. “We believe the new geography is defined by the markets, customers and vendors that businesses need to connect with most. We need ‘local’ communication with these people — whether calls originate on public-switched or VoIP networks, whether they are truly local or ‘virtually’ local.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In practice, that means a Voxbone <a title="Voxbone SP Partners" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">iNum Service Provider Partner</a> will supply a customer, whether an individual or a business, with a number that has an 883 country code. Once the service is fully rolled out to Voxbone&#8217;s 5,000 local points of presence worldwide, that iNum number will be accessible for, at most, the cost of a &#8220;local&#8221; phone call from any PSTN or VoIP service.</p>
<p>&#8220;At most,&#8221; because fundamental to Voxbone&#8217;s services is that they are IP-based and therefore calls amongst iNum Partners&#8217; services are free. Currently Voxbone has <a title="iNum Service Provider Partners" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">10 iNum Service Provider Partners</a>, including <a title="Truphone Anywhere" href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/05/28/voxbone-powers-truphone-anywhere/" target="_blank">Truphone</a>, <a title="Mobivox Overview" href="http://skypejournal.com/2008/08/catching-up-mobivox-launching-voice.html" target="_blank">Mobivox</a> and <a title="Voxeo Overview" href="http://skypejournal.com/2008/08/voxeo-textbook-case-for-voice-20-and.html" target="_blank">Voxeo</a>, who either <a title="Voxeo's iNum Services" href="http://blogs.voxeo.com/voxeotalks/2008/11/11/how-to-get-an-inum-a-global-phone-number/" target="_blank">have made iNum numbers available today</a> or will do so in the next few weeks. (For those callers who don&#8217;t use an iNum partner&#8217;s service, iNum numbers can be called through 55 <a title="iNum Local Access Points" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">&#8220;local&#8221; access points in 45 countries</a> for the cost of a call to these access points.) Ullens, <a title="iNum SquawkBox Conference Call" href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/11/12/squawk-box-november-11-inum/" target="_blank">in a SquawkBox conference call yesterday</a>, said that Voxbone will be negotiating with carriers and service providers worldwide to build out their service to become universally available.</p>
<p>Voxeo has set up a demonstration iNum service example; call +883 510 001 800 <em>028 </em><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">024</span>, give their virtual operator a U.S. postal code and you will get local weather reports. This call can be made via the iNum Partners&#8217; services today; it will become available via the local access points as they are set up over the next week. Another example: iotum&#8217;s <a title="Calliflower WWD Post Nov. 12, 2008" href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/11/12/calliflower-a-complete-conference-calling-service/" target="_blank">Callflower Conference Call service will be using iNum numbers</a> in a few days.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[[qi:114] So much for the Obama bump. The markets have resumed their downward spiral, making clear that our economic conditions aren't going to improve anytime soon. The impact of this sustained selling is even being felt by companies that were, until recently, deemed bulletproof -- among them, Google. Shares of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company have dropped below $300 for the <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Google-stock-below-300-mark/story.aspx?guid={FE050758-FAA9-414D-AFC0-5E6C1FA44800}">first time since 2005</a>, indicating that the company might not be immune to the downturn in consumer spending (and thus advertising) after all. Nick Denton, publisher of Gawker Media, makes a very compelling case as to <a href="http://nickdenton.org/5083616/a-2009-plan-for-internet-media">why online advertising is in for some stormy weather</a>.

Citibank Internet analyst Mark Mahaney earlier today cut his fourth-quarter profit and net revenue estimates on Google, saying he's picking up all sorts of negative data points. "We have conducted two dozen+ checks with SEMs (Search Engine Marketers), Online Ad Agencies, large brand retailers, high ASP retailers, travel companies, etc...Conclusions aren't uniform, but Search marketers almost universally expect Q4 to be the weakest they have ever experienced," he writes in his morning note. While these might be transitory issues for Google -- the company continues to increase market share in search and has a monopolistic control of online advertising -- as Mahaney points out, even it has nowhere to hide as the planet gets hit by this economic comet.

This downturn poses another challenge for Google as well: To date, it has been able to spending liberally on attracting talented folks to its team. But many of those options are now under water, leaving those employees to resent some of their predecessors. Maintaining its talent -- and attracting new blood -- is going to be that much harder going forward. And that will leave the company even less time to play with its new toys, such as its <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5068208/googles-very-own-fighter-jet-taking-to-the-california-skies">newly acquired fighter jet</a>.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft" src="http://gigaomnimedia.com/galleries/2008/07/iphone3g/thumbs/iphone3gunboxed5.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="99" />I was playing <a href="http://www.theiphoneblog.com/2008/07/18/lightning-review-texas-hold-em-by-apple-inc/">Texas Hold'em on the iPhone</a> the other day when it struck me: If Apple allowed one-touch financial transactions <em>inside</em> apps -- in the case of Texas Hold'em, for example, to buy $1,000 of poker chips for $1 -- the consequences could be huge. Social networks like Facebook and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/11/07/taking-on-facebook-myspace-is-working-on-its-own-virtual-gift-and-payment-systems/">MySpace</a>, games, location-based services and pure-play commerce apps could see instant windfalls with the right functionality.

Apple is in the catbird seat to dominate micropayments.  Their "batch and bill" implementation in iTunes, which boasts perhaps the smoothest online purchasing UI ever, now serves as a foundation for the App Store, creating a whole new genre of software that I call "impulseware" -- cheap enough and easy enough to buy on a whim.  I've already spent a total of $22.99 on apps for the iPhone -- some useful, some not -- since the App Store launched in the summer. Just getting people to spend on software is a feat; I, for one, haven't spent money on software anywhere else.

I would be spending a lot more if Apple extended the API to allow for the ability to transact within apps. It would give real viability to virtual gifts, currencies and goods across the myriad of apps out there by allowing pennies and dollars to change hands in a frictionless way. As both a developer and a consumer, that is exciting.

There is potentially a lot at stake here.  As we shift toward the mobile web, we are seeing a repudiation of the browser as the single, über app.  Apple has already re-inspired (and <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/08/01/iphone-app-store-numbers-reveal-large-revenue-opportunities/">perhaps revitalized</a>) the vibrant shareware industry; it now has a chance to legitimize new online business models.  Such a move would allow those of us in the tech industry to move away from our uncomfortable dependence on the "media model" that has informed web development for the last 15 years or so.  And by offering new options for generating revenue, Apple would get a leg up on Android in the battle for developer mindshare.

The carriers have had ample opportunity to spread their own payment platform, but instead their various handsets and typically unfriendly strategies toward developers have opened the door for Apple.

Social networks like Facebook and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/11/07/taking-on-facebook-myspace-is-working-on-its-own-virtual-gift-and-payment-systems/">MySpace</a>, games, location-based services and pure-play commerce apps could see instant windfalls with the right functionality.</p>
<p>Apple is in the catbird seat to dominate micropayments.  Their &#8220;batch and bill&#8221; implementation in iTunes, which boasts perhaps the smoothest online purchasing UI ever, now serves as a foundation for the App Store, creating a whole new genre of software that I call &#8220;impulseware&#8221; &#8212; cheap enough and easy enough to buy on a whim.  I&#8217;ve already spent a total of $22.99 on apps for the iPhone &#8212; some useful, some not &#8212; since the App Store launched in the summer. Just getting people to spend on software is a feat; I, for one, haven&#8217;t spent money on software anywhere else.</p>
<p>I would be spending a lot more if Apple extended the API to allow for the ability to transact within apps. It would give real viability to virtual gifts, currencies and goods across the myriad of apps out there by allowing pennies and dollars to change hands in a frictionless way. As both a developer and a consumer, that is exciting.</p>
<p>There is potentially a lot at stake here.  As we shift toward the mobile web, we are seeing a repudiation of the browser as the single, über app.  Apple has already re-inspired (and <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/08/01/iphone-app-store-numbers-reveal-large-revenue-opportunities/">perhaps revitalized</a>) the vibrant shareware industry; it now has a chance to legitimize new online business models.  Such a move would allow those of us in the tech industry to move away from our uncomfortable dependence on the &#8220;media model&#8221; that has informed web development for the last 15 years or so.  And by offering new options for generating revenue, Apple would get a leg up on Android in the battle for developer mindshare.</p>
<p>The carriers have had ample opportunity to spread their own payment platform, but instead their various handsets and typically unfriendly strategies toward developers have opened the door for Apple. The company, after upstaging the music industry titans, stands poised to extend their revolution of content delivery to that of application delivery &#8212; and in the process, to sell even more devices.</p>

That certainly is true of the new INQ Social Mobile phone from INQ, a subsidiary of Hutchinson Whampoa, a global wireless company that runs 3G networks in eight countries around the world, including the UK and Australia. INQ's new triband-with-3G phone is diminutive -- 110 g (3.9 oz) -- but it packs a powerful punch. It is smaller than a bar of Baby Ruth chocolate and is likely to cost about $50 a pop. INQ's new phone will make a debut on the <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/personal/index.omp">3 network </a>in the UK later this week, and it should raise some eyebrows and impress many.

Hutchinson's 3 network caused a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/10/24/skype-branded-mobile-phone-to-launch-on-oct-29/">sensation last year</a> when it released a phone that was designed around Skype and Skype's communication abilities. The phone proved to be a commercial and critical success. Encouraged by its success, Hutchinson decided to spin out its handset operations into a standalone company to sell phones to carriers other than 3.

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28891" title="address_book" src="http://gigaom.wordpress.com/files/2008/11/address_book.jpg?w=168" alt="address_book" width="168" height="222" />

The result is a new phone -- the first of many -- that is chasing what is going to be the biggest trend in the mobile industry: application-specific mobile phones. Frank Meehan, CEO of INQ, last month said that while "iPhone and BlackBerry Storm are sensational devices," the fact remains that carriers need more lower cost devices with great UI. "INQ isn't meant to compete with those top end devices, but instead is designed to get the core Internet comms services easy to use for the mass market," Meehan said. I agree, and after using the phone for less than a day on a slower EDGE network, I can only imagine how good a device it will be on faster networks. And its sole purpose is to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/09/18/the-carrier-panel-strategies-to-keep-mobile-data-growing/">keep the data usage growing</a> on the mobile networks so that carriers can recoup the money they spent building their 3G networks.

The phone is based on Qualcomm's 6260 chipset and uses the Brew OS. The device's whole experience is optimized for a few web applications -- Skype (obviously), Facebook, Google, instant messaging and other apps like Last.fm. All the apps show up at the bottom of screen, reminiscent of Apple's App Dock, which makes it easy to navigate through many apps. (I wonder when Nokia will buy some clues and make navigating through apps easy.)

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-28892" title="facebook_home" src="http://gigaom.wordpress.com/files/2008/11/facebook_home.jpg" alt="facebook_home" width="180" height="239" />The apps themselves have been optimized for the tiny screen experience, and worked flawlessly over a T-Mobile 2.5G EDGE connection. The Facebook app, for instance, was easy to use: I could snap pictures with the 3.2 megapixel camera and post them to Facebook with relative ease. I was suitably impressed with the way INQ has integrated Skype, Facebook and IM into the phone's address book and developed a next generation communication experience. The phone has a decent browser (Netfront 3.4) that can handle Flash, and the screen, while tiny at 2.2 inches, is good enough to use the web applications effectively.

I wish I could have tested the phone on a 3G network and not been limited by the slower EDGE connection.   Being on a slow connection, I couldn't really use Skype effectively, and I find doing messaging (IM) or replying to emails using a 12-key dialpad impossible. But I am sure there are folks who are not challenged by big thumbs and advancing years.

Now, this device isn't going to work in the U.S. -- which is a shame because I really love this tiny-yet-simple device. It is like the Toyota Scion of the mobile world -- well designed, cool, functional and inexpensive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[qi:032] Telephone companies pushing television services will gain customers by offering lower prices than cable or satellite providers, according to a <a href="http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=167808">survey being presented today by Heavy Reading</a>. The survey, which consisted of about 200 consumer interviews, found that price, more than special interactive features, will dictate which provider consumers turn to. That's grim news for the telcos, which have been spending heavily to lay fiber and upgrade their networks so they can offer the triple play of voice, video and data in order to better  compete with cable companies. <span id="more-28964"></span>

The pitch on the part of telcos is that consumers tired of boring TV delivered by their cable company could switch to a more <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/02/19/waiting-for-u-verse-in-austin/">interactive experience through</a>, such as those offered by AT&#38;T's  U-verse service or FiOS TV or Verizon. And for the privilege of such an experience, they would pay more. Of course many of those features, such as alternate camera angles and personalized channels, haven't yet been rolled out. In the meantime, cable companies are offering digital video recorders and <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1192749,00.html">interactive services such as Start Over</a> as part of their digital cable packages.

In fact, a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/09/30/survey-sayscable-sucks/">survey in September</a> found that consumers weren't even happy with the current pricing or service being provided by their cable companies -- suggesting that undercutting cable companies while providing better service is the key to gaining their business. That being said, many of the consumers in the September survey said they'd be happy to switch to telco TV if the price was right. It looks like that for all the technical innovation, the promise of the triple-play bundle isn't about service, but about the bargain. Carriers will have to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/07/your-future-broadband-will-cost-more-for-less/">find other ways to boost</a> their <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/09/04/while-nebuad-retreats-phorm-and-bt-plow-ahead/">bottom lines for the time being</a>.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/12/sony-ericsson-xperia-x1-best-winmobile-phone/"><img src="http://gigaom.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/x1_slider_black_1.jpg?w=126&#038;h=117" width="126" height="117" /></a> For the last couple of days I have been playing around with what could arguably be the best Windows Mobile phone in business –<a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/x1/index.aspx?en-us"> Sony Ericsson’s Xperia X1</a>. From the packaging to the diminutive USB charger to the sleek finish of the device itself, the whole X1 experience is flawless. It is a well-designed smartphone that is very well-engineered. It is no different than Sony VAIO laptops or Bravia TVs, and as such it's no surprise that it's expensive: $799. The device is going to be available in the U.S. starting Nov. 28 on Sony's web site, <a href="http://sonystyle.com">Sony Style.</a>

It comes with a very comfortable slider keyboard, great connectivity options <em>(WiFi, 3G, Quad-band GSM etc.)</em> and is a multimedia powerhouse. The phone comes with a 3-inch WVGA display with resolution of up to 800 X 480 pixels screen, which means it can play back videos in almost DVD quality and makes it easy to play 3D mobile games. I love the photos taken by the 3.2 megapixel camera and the music playback is solid and clear. X1 has a pretty decent battery life -- and yes, it beats the pants off the iPhone 3G battery. It got about 8 hours on AT&#38;T's 3G network -- ahead of my iPhone -- but lagged the Android G1. However, it had better GSM standby and talk times. But again, battery usage differs from person to person. One thing I hate about the device is that it lacks built-in memory, but the good news is that it can take up to 32 GB in a memory card.

What will surprise you the most is that this phone is powered by Windows Mobile 6.1. Despite the torturous Windows Mobile interface, I found myself liking this device, which shows that with some creativity and lots of imagination, even Windows Mobile can stand up to assaults from Apple's iPhone, RIM's ( s rimm) Blackberry and Google's Android. Of course Windows Mobile means that the phone syncs with Microsoft Exchange over the air. It can read documents, spreadsheets and presentations natively.

I was surprised by how nimble the phone feels -- I have yet to use another Windows Mobile phone that comes close to X1. The device gives you many ways to interact with the contact touch, full QWERTY keyboard, 4-way key and optical joystick navigation and panels. It is the panels which are awesome and function almost like how the applications are accessed on the iPhone.

<strong>Bottomline</strong>: If your company insists that you need a Windows Mobile phone, then Xperia X1 is an obvious (and perhaps the only) choice.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/briansolis/3006038315/sizes/s/"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3009/3006038315_6aefb394c4_m.jpg" alt="John Doerr at Web 2.0 Summit" width="240" height="160" /></a>At last week's Web 2.0 Summit -- the annual convention that has come to represent the new web boom –- a leading web industry journalist asked me if green technology was here to stay, or if it is just another fad that would die at the hands of dropping gas prices and a recession. <span id="more-28707"></span>"I think it’s one of the world’s biggest opportunities," I responded, and what I wish I’d have added is this: It’s also trumping the web in terms of excitement, innovation and inspiration for the next generation of entrepreneurs.

That cleantech is, at the very least, what people are excited about was obvious at last week's Summit. Green startups -- even those that had little to do with the web -- took over large parts of the show. Former Vice President, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Kleiner Perkins cleantech investor <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/07/al-gore-calls-for-web-20-to-fight-climate-change/">Al Gore received a standing ovation for his keynote</a>. The CEO and Chairman of high-profile electric vehicle startup <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/09/tesla-ceo-to-pump-more-money-into-electric-car-startup/">Tesla Motors, Elon Musk</a>, and the CEO of electric vehicle infrastructure startup Better Place, Shai Agassi, both had long fireside chats with the conference-organizers. And half of the startups in the launchpad section of the show were green companies -- <a href="http://carbonetworks.com/">Carbonetworks</a>, <a href="http://www.goodguide.com/">GoodGuide</a> and <a href="http://www.sungevity.com/">Sungevity</a>.
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Perhaps the biggest indicator at the show, though, was when John Doerr, partner at <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/05/john-doerr-green-is-whats-growing-in-the-valley/">Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, declared</a> green technology to be “the growing thing in Silicon Valley” and said kick-starting energy research will be President-elect Barack Obama’s most important task. Kleiner was responsible for Internet investments like Google (GOOG) and has now allocated a third of its fund to green investments -- equal to the amount it’s pumping into digital media/web plays. Doerr even told the audience that Kleiner partner Bill Joy would be a good choice for Obama’s Chief Technology Officer; Joy has stated for the past year that <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2007/10/16/bill-joy-green-tech-investing-trumps-internet/">he is staying away from most Internet investments</a> and focusing entirely on innovations to fight climate change.</p>

So far, the overall venture dollars have started to follow this path, too. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers and National Venture Capital Association, while venture funding for the third quarter of 2008 was down 7 percent from the second quarter to $7.1 billion, cleantech’s portion of that investment grew 14 percent over the second quarter to $1 billion. Internet companies accounted for $1.1 billion of those venture dollars, a 36 percent drop from the second quarter. <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&#38;newsId=20060810005309&#38;newsLang=en">Back in 2006, cleantech became</a> the third largest venture category, under biotech and software, and remained the third largest in the latest quarter.

That’s not to say that cleantech investing won’t be affected by the current financial crisis. Analysts with the Cleantech Group are expecting that in the next quarter later-stage green firms that need to raise a lot of capital –- e.g., to fund biofuel plants, solar thermal farms or green car factories -- could find trouble. Tesla Motors already <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/09/tesla-ceo-to-pump-more-money-into-electric-car-startup/">couldn’t raise</a> a planned $100 million financing round on the terms it wanted and turned to an internal round of $40 million, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk carrying half the load. Large clean power projects <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/10/29/t-boone-may-scale-back-wind-project/">like T. Boone Pickens' wind farm</a> are also getting cut back.

But the overall cleantech industry will survive a downturn. The opportunity for entrepreneurs and innovation is large — and just starting to be realized. Energy alone is a $6 trillion market, compared to $100 billion for the Internet. And the industries that cleantech entrepreneurs are trying to tackle -- power generation, the power grid, the water system -- have been largely neglected in terms of technology innovation. As Thomas Friedman points out in "Hot, Flat, and Crowded," paraphrasing GE's CEO Jeffrey Immelt: Over three decades GE has sold eight or nine generations of medical devices, but only one generation of energy technology.

There's also the fact that the underlying problems that have lead to the ascendancy of cleantech are still persistent. The price of gas might fluctuate wildly, but the planet is still growing increasingly warm, and the population is still expected to boom to more than 9 billion people in the next three decades — largely in developing countries like India and China. Cleantech is about figuring out smart, sustainable ways to allocate resources like energy, water, and raw materials; the need for which won't disappear in the face of temporarily cheap fuel.

The recession could also turn federal legislators green in the coming months. President-elect Obama is calling for the creation of 5 million green jobs in a decade and has pledged to provide more support for renewable energy than any other previous administration. <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/05/what-obamas-victory-means-for-cleantech/">Josh Green, managing partner at MDV</a> thinks that Obama's cleantech plan will make up part of the economic recovery package, <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/10/al-gores-5-steps-to-deliver-100-clean-power-in-a-decade/">as does Al Gore</a>. If green jobs really can help ease the pain of the recession, the cleantech industry would find even more government and private sector support when we eventually get to better financial times.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/briansolis/3006038315/sizes/s/"><span class="iw"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3009/3006038315_6aefb394c4_m.jpg" alt="John Doerr at Web 2.0 Summit" width="240" height="160" /><span class="iw1"></span><span class="iw2"></span><span class="iw3"></span><span class="iw4"></span></span></a>At last week&#8217;s Web 2.0 Summit &#8212; the annual convention that has come to represent the new web boom –- a leading web industry journalist asked me if green technology was here to stay, or if it is just another fad that would die at the hands of dropping gas prices and a recession. &#8220;I think it’s one of the world’s biggest opportunities,&#8221; I responded, and what I wish I’d have added is this: It’s also trumping the web in terms of excitement, innovation and inspiration for the next generation of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>That cleantech is, at the very least, what people are excited about was obvious at last week&#8217;s Summit. Green startups &#8212; even those that had little to do with the web &#8212; took over large parts of the show. Former Vice President, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Kleiner Perkins cleantech investor <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/07/al-gore-calls-for-web-20-to-fight-climate-change/">Al Gore received a standing ovation for his keynote</a>. The CEO and Chairman of high-profile electric vehicle startup <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/09/tesla-ceo-to-pump-more-money-into-electric-car-startup/">Tesla Motors, Elon Musk</a>, and the CEO of electric vehicle infrastructure startup Better Place, Shai Agassi, both had long fireside chats with the conference-organizers. And half of the startups in the launchpad section of the show were green companies &#8212; <a href="http://carbonetworks.com/">Carbonetworks</a>, <a href="http://www.goodguide.com/">GoodGuide</a> and <a href="http://www.sungevity.com/">Sungevity</a>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Perhaps the biggest indicator at the show, though, was when John Doerr, partner at <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/05/john-doerr-green-is-whats-growing-in-the-valley/">Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, declared</a> green technology to be “the growing thing in Silicon Valley” and said kick-starting energy research will be President-elect Barack Obama’s most important task. Kleiner was responsible for Internet investments like Google (GOOG) and has now allocated a third of its fund to green investments &#8212; equal to the amount it’s pumping into digital media/web plays. Doerr even told the audience that Kleiner partner Bill Joy would be a good choice for Obama’s Chief Technology Officer; Joy has stated for the past year that <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2007/10/16/bill-joy-green-tech-investing-trumps-internet/">he is staying away from most Internet investments</a> and focusing entirely on innovations to fight climate change.</p>
<p>So far, the overall venture dollars have started to follow this path, too. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers and National Venture Capital Association, while venture funding for the third quarter of 2008 was down 7 percent from the second quarter to $7.1 billion, cleantech’s portion of that investment grew 14 percent over the second quarter to $1 billion. Internet companies accounted for $1.1 billion of those venture dollars, a 36 percent drop from the second quarter. <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20060810005309&amp;newsLang=en">Back in 2006, cleantech became</a> the third largest venture category, under biotech and software, and remained the third largest in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that cleantech investing won’t be affected by the current financial crisis. Analysts with the Cleantech Group are expecting that in the next quarter later-stage green firms that need to raise a lot of capital –- e.g., to fund biofuel plants, solar thermal farms or green car factories &#8212; could find trouble. Tesla Motors already <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/09/tesla-ceo-to-pump-more-money-into-electric-car-startup/">couldn’t raise</a> a planned $100 million financing round on the terms it wanted and turned to an internal round of $40 million, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk carrying half the load. Large clean power projects <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/10/29/t-boone-may-scale-back-wind-project/">like T. Boone Pickens&#8217; wind farm</a> are also getting cut back.</p>
<p>But the overall cleantech industry will survive a downturn. The opportunity for entrepreneurs and innovation is large — and just starting to be realized. Energy alone is a $6 trillion market, compared to $100 billion for the Internet. And the industries that cleantech entrepreneurs are trying to tackle &#8212; power generation, the power grid, the water system &#8212; have been largely neglected in terms of technology innovation. As Thomas Friedman points out in &#8220;Hot, Flat, and Crowded,&#8221; paraphrasing GE&#8217;s CEO Jeffrey Immelt: Over three decades GE has sold eight or nine generations of medical devices, but only one generation of energy technology.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the fact that the underlying problems that have lead to the ascendancy of cleantech are still persistent. The price of gas might fluctuate wildly, but the planet is still growing increasingly warm, and the population is still expected to boom to more than 9 billion people in the next three decades — largely in developing countries like India and China. Cleantech is about figuring out smart, sustainable ways to allocate resources like energy, water, and raw materials; the need for which won&#8217;t disappear in the face of temporarily cheap fuel.</p>
<p>The recession could also turn federal legislators green in the coming months. President-elect Obama is calling for the creation of 5 million green jobs in a decade and has pledged to provide more support for renewable energy than any other previous administration. <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/05/what-obamas-victory-means-for-cleantech/">Josh Green, managing partner at MDV</a> thinks that Obama&#8217;s cleantech plan will make up part of the economic recovery package, <a href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/10/al-gores-5-steps-to-deliver-100-clean-power-in-a-decade/">as does Al Gore</a>. If green jobs really can help ease the pain of the recession, the cleantech industry would find even more government and private sector support when we eventually get to better financial times.</p>

Because when you have a <a href="http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=2558">laughably small number of mobile television viewers</a>, you may as well try a different standard in <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/03/24/do-we-really-need-more-mobile-tv/">hopes that it will succeed</a> where others have failed. The standard, created by the <a href="http://www.atsc.org/">Advanced Television Systems Committee,</a> has succeeded in trials at <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/rss/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212001367&#38;cid=RSSfeed_eetimes_semiRSS">easily delivering broadcast television to mobile phones, using existing spectrum</a>. However, the content won't be linked back to the Internet -- this version of mobile TV turns your phone or other portable devices into a mini-TV.

The ATSC standard will compete with Qualcomm's MediaFLO technology that AT&#38;T and Verizon use to deliver mobile television to subscribers, but unlike MediaFLO, it doesn't require a separate network to broadcast the shows. A group of broadcast networks, LG Electronics and Samsung are part of a coalition called the <a href="http://www.omvc.org/">Open Mobile Video Coalition</a> working with the ATSC to create a single standard for delivering mobile television to cell phones and other devices by 2009, when the switch to digital television is complete.

The ATSC plans to formally approve its mobile TV standard later this month. Chips and systems will be available before the end of 2009. Initial offerings are likely to appear in the automotive space. I have tons of questions about this service that I'm trying to get answered and will update y'all if any of the parties gets back to me.<a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/11/broadcasters-boost-mobile-tv-with-new-standard/"><img src="http://gigaom.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/chart_dtv101.jpg?w=126&#038;h=59" width="126" height="59" /></a>]]></description>
