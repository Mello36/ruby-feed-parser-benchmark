      <title>HardwareGeeks Holiday Gift Guide</title>
      <link>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/hardwaregeeks_holiday_gift_guide/</link>
      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/hardwaregeeks_holiday_gift_guide/#When:04:00:00Z</guid>
      <description>Can you believe it? It&#8217;s the holiday season again and it feels as if no time has passed since we last put together this gift guide for you all. Times may be rough, the economy is not as great as it should be and there really isn&#8217;t a lot of money going around, but on the bright side, this all can be a great thing for you. Why?? Well because retailers are having outrageous sales so there&#8217;s a chance you may find a bunch of the things that we&#8217;ve included in this guide for dirt cheap (or maybe not). I guess it&#8217;ll depend on what your Geek wants. We&#8217;ll guarantee you&#8217;ll find some great stuff in this years guide though!


We wanted to limit the list to just 10 items, but there are so many cool things available we just had to make room for them all, and unlike previous years two people have joined forces to put this list together. Me (Michael) and Radiris, the two of us looked over every product we reviewed this year and have narrowed it down to the 12 best on this list.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>Relink outlook to MAILTO:</title>
      <link>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/relink_outlook_to_mailto/</link>
      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/relink_outlook_to_mailto/#When:19:35:00Z</guid>
      <description>So lately I&#8217;ve been getting reports of a recent update making it so outlook no longer handles MAILTO: links causing all sorts of confusion in other office programs so I cooked up a little registry file that seems to fix it. This registry file is for office 2003 but changing OFFICE11 to OFFICE12 should make it work for office 2007 as well.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>HP Notebooks to get Better Battery Option</title>
      <link>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/hp_notebooks_to_get_better_battery_option/</link>
      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/hp_notebooks_to_get_better_battery_option/#When:18:17:00Z</guid>
      <description>I was reading on News.com today about how HP will have better batteries as an option on their consumer notebooks and thought I would share the news with you all. 


According to the article on average users change their notebook battery 5 times at a cost of 150 &#45; 180 dollars. Notebook batteries on average begin to go bad after 150 odd charges. With the new batteries that HP will have available sometime next year, you will be able to get 1000 or more charges before the battery begins to go bad. 


HP will only be selling these batteries as an option so your system will note default to these batteries, mainly because of the added cost of 20 to 30 dollars that comes with these batteries. However you can get them as an option for 20 to 30 dollars which is well worth it in the long run.


So next year when you are buying your brand new HP notebook, look out for the new SONATA longer lasting batteries.&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <description>Logitech today unveild the G13 Advanced Gameboard, a hybrid gaming keyboard designed to make it easier and more comfortable to control the game you are playing on your Mac or PC, especially if you have the G15 keyboard and G9 laser mouse.


&#8220;If you&#8217;re into serious gaming, there&#8217;s no better feeling than playing with the G13 gameboard by your side,&#8221; said Ruben Mookerjee, Logitech&#8217;s director of product marketing for gaming. &#8220;Unlike other gameboards that focus only on programmability, the G13 advanced gameboard incorporates the principles of our award&#45;winning Comfort Wave design. So whether you&#8217;re getting into World of Warcraft&#174; or walking into your next LAN party, the G13 gameboard gives you a powerful advantage over those forced to work with less.&#8221;<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>Vonage Raises Prices on Phone Plans</title>
      <link>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/vonage_raises_prices_on_phone_plans/</link>
      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/vonage_raises_prices_on_phone_plans/#When:19:54:00Z</guid>
      <description>Vonage started to notify it&#8217;s customers last week that they (Vonage) has increased the price of their phone plans. The cheapest $14.99 plan has been increased to $17.99 and after fees users will see charges for around $23.00. 


Depending on when you signed up with the Vonage service you will see the price change on your bill, some Vonage users I have spoken too say they are still paying $14.99 for their service while others say they have already been billed $17.99. 


Personally I think the increase comes at a bad time and Vonage is bound to loose a lot of customers. However I still do believe that Vonage is the best VoIP service provider around and the increase is still with in my budget.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>Upgrade your NZXT Whisper Case for Free</title>

      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/upgrade_your_nzxt_whisper_case_for_free/#When:19:03:00Z</guid>
      <description>Do you have a Whisper Case from NZXT like Angel does? If you do the holidays have come early as NZXT are allowing you to get a free upgrade for it.


No you can&#8217;t trade it in for a better case (as it is probably the best case the have) but you can request a new component for free that attaches to the front of the case to allow for better air flow. All you have to do is contact RMA@nzxt.com to request the part. Just tell them you have a Whisper case and you want the part that gives it increased air flow.

      <title>Review: HP Pavilion dv5</title>

      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/review_hp_pavilion_dv5/#When:00:26:01Z</guid>
      <description>Ever wonder what beauty and brawn would look like if the two were merged? Well if it were a notebook it would look like the HP Pavilion dv5, it is one sexy piece of machine.


After having met with AMD during the summer I can admit to really knowing what I&#8217;m talking about when I say the dv5 is powered by an AMD cpu (aka its hardcore) with ATI graphics.&amp;nbsp; The reason we chose to review this configuration over Intel&#8217;s is because AMD did an extraordinary job of displaying the differences between how it handled Blu&#45;Ray play back (hugeeeeeee difference). It handled it better than Intels.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

It features a 10.2&#45;inch diagonal BrightView display, fashionable wallpaper, 8&#45;color finish and custom slip cover.

      <description>This past Black Friday, Microsoft ran a promo I told you guys about on their Live Cashback Site. The promo offered 40% cash back on all of your HP purchases during a 12 hour period on Black Friday. 


Well just like the Dr. Pepper debacle, Microsoft couldn&#8217;t handle the demand, their server began to act funky and people were unable to take advantage of the promotion they promised to them.


HP who had no part in the promotion, just that they were the company Microsoft offered the promotion with felt bad at this, and sources from both HP and Microsoft had told me they were working on a deal to bring back the offer, and from my understanding HP was even going to help out.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>My First Zip Car</title>
      <link>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/my_first_zip_car/</link>
      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/my_first_zip_car/#When:05:40:00Z</guid>
      <description>Today, rather yesterday I reserved my first Zip Car, a red Mazda 3 named Ma&#8217;am. Nice looking car until I stood in front of it and noticed that it was damaged on the right side. Technically left side (driver side) but since I was standing in front of it, it was too my right but anyway.


One of the six rules of Zipcar is to report damage right away, so before I could even open the car I called Zip Car about 4 minutes before my reservation to inform them of the damage. I expected to speak with someone but instead I was asked to leave a message. Which kind of annoyed me, and somewhat scared me because I am reporting damage to an answering machine. For something like this I would lie to speak to a human being, and know that someone else besides an answering machine knows there is damage too the car.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <description>Today HP announced that their new Mini 1000 systems will be available with Mobile Broadband, the announcement comes a week after Dell announced thier Mini 9 would have a Mobile Broadband option.


The method of activating WWAN on the Mini 1000 is with HP Connection Manager 1.1. HP Connection Manager provides a single connection solution for 2008 HP mobile broadband minis and notebooks, and supports multiple operators on both GSM and CDMA based networks with self activation capabilities on select partner operator networks.


The Mini 1000 is available with the mobile broadband option today exclusively through http://www.hpdirect.com for an additional $199 above the cost of the Mini itself. No word if there will be any rebates offered from the wireless provider.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <description>Today I am officially a member of Zipcar, and I am pretty darn excited.


If you don&#8217;t know what ZipCar is,visit ZipCar.com. Well I also can explain it. Basically i is like a co&#45;op car rental service. You pay a yearly or monthly fee depending on your plan and you can rent a car for as little as 7 bucks an hour depending on your plan (That is if I did my math right). With the rental you get free gas and insurance. You just have to obey the rules, like keep the car clean etc. Those rules are easy rules to follow, but if you break them you can be hit with penalties which aren&#8217;t cheap.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <description>Maybe it was the 40% cash back Microsoft was offering on HP products for 12 hours this past Friday, or maybe it is the sheer popularity of HP Products as of late, but what ever it is HP has nailed the competition.


According to analyst for every 1 Dell products bought this past weekend, 5 HP products were purchased in Best Buy. 


That&#8217;s huge! 5 to 1 is huge and a major victory for HP, and we are starting to see a trend with HP and Dell with the number 5, anyone recall the &#8220;Dude your Dell died 5 hours ago&#8221; ads HP ran in some major news papers not to long ago?<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>Affordable Gift Idea for the Holidays</title>

      <guid>http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/affordable_gift_idea_for_the_holidays/#When:18:48:00Z</guid>
      <description>As we all know times are kind of tough right now, money is tight and Christmas budgets are down.&amp;nbsp; 


My personal Christmas Budget is way down, I don&#8217;t plan to spend more than 500 dollars this year and that is way way way way way down from last year where I spent nearly $2500. I have limited all my friends to gifts under 20 dollars and only relatives will get anything more than 20 but definitely less than 50. 


This brings me to my mother&#8217;s gift and my idea for everyone who is on a budget. Mothers sometimes can be hard to please and I personally don&#8217;t want to give my mom any kitchen appliances. Sure she may love those but I want to give her something she will ENJOY out of the kitchen, something she will use and can show off to her friends.<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>

      <title>Apple encourages Mac users to use Multiple Anti&#45;Virus programs</title>

      <description>&#8220;Apple encourages the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent, thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult. Here are some available antivirus utilities&#8221; reads the entry on the Apple Support site.


For years some Apple users have claimed Apple systems do not get viruses and therefore Apple users do not need to get AV software, and even until now Apple has never recommended the use of Multiple AV programs. So does this change indicate that Apple suspects Virus makers will begin targeting Apple users more now than in the past?


I personally have always said, once the Apple Market Share goes up Virus Writers will have a bigger incentive to go after Apple users.&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/click/"><img src="http://ypn-rss.overture.com/rss/35400/img/?url=&amp;pid=6448108370" alt="Ads by Yahoo!" border="0"/></a></description>
