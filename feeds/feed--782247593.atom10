			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/129/rewiring-the-creative-mind.html?page=0,0">provocative article</a> in the October issue of <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com">Fast Company</a> magazine that’s adapted from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1422115011?tag=moskalyukcom-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1422115011&amp;adid=0X5CGR3MTX43JJ80ATM7&amp;">Iconoclast: A Neuroscientist Reveals How to Think Differently</a> by Gregory Burns. In it, the author explores the process of creativity by analyzing the brain activity that’s happening when a truly creative or inventive thought hits the brain. Some bad news:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offsites and scheduled brainstorms are ineffective, as the brain has time to prepare, and it becomes a routine procedure.</li>
<li>Analogies are brain’s shortcuts designed to avoid creative process.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second point is the most interesting. Lazy by nature, human brain prefers to use analogies instead of starting a hardcore creative thinking session. Analogies are fast and convenient, the brain knows how to deal with them, and hence always tries to use them up before coming up with anything truly original.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, the networks that govern both perception and imagination can be reprogrammed. By deploying your attention differently, the frontal cortex, which contains rules for decision making, can reconfigure neural networks so that you can see things that you didn&#8217;t see before. You need a novel stimulus &#8212; either a new piece of information or an unfamiliar environment - to jolt attentional systems awake. The more radical the change, the greater the likelihood of fresh insights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article (I haven’t read the book) then lists a few examples of innovative processes that happened outside of the usual environments, thus leading to striking discoveries.</p>
<p>It seems that software engineering, an occupation that is usually connected with creative spark among most observers, is most of the time an exercise of relying on analogies. When you’re in college, you go through data structures and algorithms course, which teaches the generally accepted ways of running a queue or generating a number of permutations from a set of numbers. Later on, in the field, we frequently refer to design patterns, frameworks or best practices to bring previously acquired analogies into the new project we’re working on.</p>
<p>Analogy usage is incentivized – most of the software engineers would expect higher pay for more years of experience, which implies either a better ability to project analogies onto existing project (senior engineers which code faster) or a wider exposure to various projects in the past (senior engineers who have architectural knowledge about a variety of projects).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like Malcolm Gladwell, but after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001G60FTI?tag=moskalyukcom-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B001G60FTI&amp;adid=1XK53BPRY7K4DAFZE97G&amp;">Blink</a> I found that his ideas, usually written out in hundred-page books, can be summed up in a few paragraphs. So if you’re looking for a short summary of his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316017922?tag=moskalyukcom-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0316017922&amp;adid=05ZSZHJM3JKHC0MTEP4S&amp;">Outliers: The Story of Success</a>, look no further than <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/nov/15/malcolm-gladwell-outliers-extract">the excerpt published in this week’s Guardian</a>. In a nutshell, someone practicing a certain craft (computer programming, violin, sports) for more than 10,000 hours&#160; becomes do adept at it, that we mistakenly look for some innate abilities and call it talent.</p>
<p>There’s also the element of sheer luck of being at the right place at the right time that amounts to success – Bill Gates with access to computer programming resources and kits at an early age had a certain advantage over someone in Africa, who perhaps had the same business acumen, but did not have the resources readily accessible to become one of the world’s wealthiest businessmen. There’s <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/11/news/companies/secretsofsuccess_gladwell.fortune/index.htm">an interview with Gladwell on CNN Money</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bill Gates has this utterly extraordinary series of opportunities. When he&#8217;s 13, it&#8217;s 1969. He shows up at his private school in Seattle, and they have a computer room with a teletype machine that is hooked up to a mainframe downtown. Anyone who was playing on the teletype machine could do real-time programming. Ninety-nine percent of the universities in America in 1969 did not have that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether or not Prop. 8 passes in California on November 4th, there’s one clear winner – California news media. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/30/BA2K13RINU.DTL">According to San Francisco Chronicle</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>…the mayor told guests on Wednesday that they need about $5 million from now until election day to battle Prop. 8, the most expensive social-issue campaign in U.S. history. Political analysts are expecting both sides to spend a total of $70 million.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both sides happily pump the money into defending their positions, and it seems that the media industry is happy to receive extra $70 mln, with the ad market being down and all doom and gloom on the economic front. </p>
<p>In fact, &lt;<strong>conspiracy-theory-start</strong>&gt; it seems that the media itself every once in a while would be in the position to start a controversial issue, raise enough awareness for some activist group to put it up on the ballot, and then enjoy the windfall revenues that wouldn’t have come otherwise.&lt;/<strong>conspiracy-theory-end</strong>&gt;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New FDIC insurance limits are ironically likely to negatively impact the stock markets, since a large group of people relying on bank CDs for fixed income (mainly seniors), will now take the money out of the stock market and reinvest it in something more stable (<strong>WaMu</strong> is still offering 5% yields for 12 month CDs online). </p>
<p>Previously anybody with excess of $100k in savings had to reshuffle the savings among multiple banking institutions, sometimes agreeing to a lower rate, or foregoing banking entirely in favor of bonds and stocks. It was a total pain, and I am surprised the bank industry did not act on its own to bump up insurance limits through private insurance companies. <strong>CNN</strong> actually points out, that had such insurance ceilings been in place, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/02/news/companies/banks_fdic_limits/">WaMu might have survived</a>, instead of suffering the death of thousand withdrawals.</p>
<p>It’s not quite clear why other mechanisms weren’t considered as a response to economic emergency, if it’s truly is an emergency. I think more legislators rushed to do <strong>something</strong> instead of doing <strong>something meaningful</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Removing the upper limit on 401(k)</strong> and other retirement savings accounts would pump up the money into the banking and financial industry. Contributing to the retirement account is one of major ways of avoiding income tax, and it’s mainly relevant for higher income brackets, but it’s the overpaid execs that the TV raves about that might actually pump billions into the market. From a free market perspective having an upper limit on your retirement savings makes as much sense as universal salary for every citizen – the government says they know much money you’re going to need at retirement, and you’re supposed to take their work for it. </li>
<li><strong>Cutting income tax across the board </strong>would probably achieve a greater psychological effect than selective tax breaks and reshuffling income tax responsibilities among different brackets. Everybody would suddenly have a bit more money, and everybody would spend the money differently, so you wouldn’t have just limited sectors of the economy affected, as it happened with last year’s stimulus checks. In the current economic climate some people would choose to save up, which would pump more money into the financial sector. </li>
<li><strong>Letting private investors bid on the failed CDOs</strong> is probably something that Treasury is still considering doing. At this discounted rate subprime mortgages start to look interesting again for a riskier investor, but having the Feds promising to buy them outright, without naming any prices, creates a chilling effect on any free market activity that might involve CDOs. </li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href="http://toni.org/">Toni Schneider</a> of Automattic spoke today at <a href="http://startup2startup.com/2008/09/11/sept25-mattmullenweg-tonischneider/">Startup2Startup dinner in Palo Alto</a>. Automattic runs this interesting model, where <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress as software</a> is distributed for free under GPL, but <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress as hosting service</a> is a <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2006/03/the_freemium_bu.html">freemium</a> product. They charge users of the hosted service for some optional extra features, but do not insist on it. They also display occasional ads on hosted free blogs, as Toni Schneider put it, to the users who are likely to click on them – IE readers arriving from search engines.</p>
<p>Some takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Matt is a great supporter of GPL. Not only from philosophical standpoint, but from practical – it requires people to contribute back, and hence build community. </li>
<li>Don’t hire <strong>all</strong> the contributors, once you have the company started. This will ruin the community effect, as evidenced by MySQL. You also gain outside perspecives by having contributors working for different companies. </li>
<li>By open-sourcing the founders effectively lose the iron grip. Even people who have commit access now have to go through a discussion in bug system. </li>
<li>Wordpress benefits greatly fro having all the developers work from home. More time spent with families, more efficient developers, who can take an after-lunch nap. The company is run via IRC channel. </li>
<li>Automattic will even help you with scaling, if you’re a large organization adopting WordPress. You’re unlikely to surpass their scale, and they’ve been where you’re now, so they know what works for scaling out. </li>
<li>Personal relationships matter a lot. So Automattic still has twice-a-year meetings of the entire team. Early developers were all people Matt knew personally – personal connections help out a great bit in a virtual organization. </li>
<li>Wordpress really started taking off as open source project with introduction of plugins and themes. It’s easy to develop both, and most of the Wordpress installations run roughly 5 plugins, and it’s long-tailish.</li>
<li>Wordpress as a project did not do a good job early on maintaining the directlory of plugins and themes. After opening up SVN for plugin developers, the plugin directory got traction. Designers did not quite catch on to SVN, so Automattic had to provide a way to drop a zip file onto the site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/">Dave</a> for organizing all this, and I specifically liked the after-dinner table discussion. It’s very structured – 8-10 people at a dinner table, a few VCs, a few entrepreneurs, a few random people, and a moderator. Moderator comes to the dinner with discussion points prepared, and ensures each guest has a chance to speak. After all the structured discussion is out of the way, it’s time for anybody at the table to ask any question, which some entrepreneurs used to gauge interest in their startups and gain feedback on business models. </p>
<p>The dinner table discussions are off the record, so can’t blog about those, but there were some pretty interesting companies – <a href="http://mjam.at/tour/">mjam</a>, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Get Satisfaction</a>, and others.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t go to ZendCon this year, but I just finished reading <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com">Mike Naberezny&#8217;</a>s and <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew">Matthew Weier O&#8217;Phinney</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/2008/09/16/php-developer-best-practices/">PHP Developer Best Practices</a>, and it&#8217;s a pretty good compendium of what to do if your organization is developing in PHP, or perhaps you&#8217;re working on a project that has potential to attract more contributors and maybe even grow into a company.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use source control</strong>
<ol>
<li>First, choose between distributed and non-distributed</li>
<li>Then, if you chose non-distributed, choose between CVS and SVN</li>
<li>In Subversion, use trunk/ for ongoing development and bug fixes, branches/ for ongoing large projects that later need to be merged in, and tags/ for releases</li>
<li>Use svn externals to connect to remote repositories</li>
<li>Subversion supports pre-commit and post-commit hooks for better code maintainability and checks</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Implement coding standards</strong>
<ol>
<li>Develop class, variable, function, package, etc. naming conventions</li>
<li>Agree on common formatting as far as spacing, braces, etc.</li>
<li>Implement comment standards</li>
<li><a href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> can run on pre-commit to check whether the commit adheres to the standards</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget to enforce coding standards on any outsourced projects</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit testing and code coverage</strong>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> for unit testing</li>
<li>For continuous integration, check out <a href="http://phpundercontrol.org/">phpUnderControl</a></li>
<li>For integration testing, check out <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a>, a general Web application testing suite</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t invent your own standards, see what <a href="http://phpdoc.org/">phpDocumentor</a> has to offer. Doxygen also supports phpDoc tags</li>
<li>For documenting the software project, try <a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a> - XML-based format that allows you to quickly publish a PDF document, or a Website with documentation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>
<ol>
<li>Have a standard deployment process that a rookie can familiarize with quickly</li>
<li>Support 3 environments - development, staging, and production</li>
<li>Deploy code only from repository tags, don&#8217;t run trunk, or allow code editing on server</li>
<li>Check out a new tag from SVN, point the symlink to it. If something goes wrong during release, change the symlink back to the previous version - easy rollback strategy</li>
<li>Everything that needs to be done on the production servers needs to be automated</li>
<li>You can do another Selenium test after the release is deployed</li>
<li>Check out <a href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/">Monit</a> and <a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisord</a> for deployment monitoring</li>
</ol>
</li>

Because, you see, there are quite a few commonplace things that we take for granted, but cannot quite explain from the scientific point of view. Sure, you&#8217;ll say, it must be some extra-hard scientific stuff, a formula understandable only by an army of advanced PhDs who spend their lives figuring out these ultra-complicated tasks.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. It turns out that life itself is quite a mystery from the scientific point of view.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Life</strong>. In theory life in the universe appeared when electric currents went through the masses of hydrogen, ammonia, water and methane, therefore creating something animate out of a set of inanimate chemicals. In practice, for a few decades the scientists have been trying to achieve a similar effect on a smaller scale, but so far no one has been able to produce the Holy Grail - turning something lifeless into something that is actually live, such as a single-cell organism. The life itself, it seems, is a scientific anomaly that should not happen in this Universe according to the existing laws of chemistry. </li>
<li><strong>Death</strong>. You&#8217;ve heard it before: two things you cannot avoid in life are death and taxes. Well, this is a very human-centric view of things, as it turns out there&#8217;s a variety of species (most of them vertebrates) that only get better with age. Some turtles, it seems, only get healthier and produce more children with age. Moreover, scientists are aware only of non-natural causes of their deaths - being run over by a truck or attacked by a bird. Are those turtles immortal, or are we observing just a small stage of their lifecycles (which could eclipse ours by generations)? </li>
<li><strong>Dark matter</strong>. It&#8217;s not embarrassing for scientists to admit they don&#8217;t know something. After all, there are plenty of little details that remain unknown in many branches of science. So not knowing what constitutes dark matter would be an acceptable excuse, if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a> comprises 96% of the Universe. We know that the Universe keeps expanding, but we cannot quite describe how and what happens to the space that used to be compacted previously. Dark matter is the giant elephant in the room in discussions related to astronomy or physics - we don&#8217;t know what it is, we&#8217;ve never seen it, and only infer its existence, yet roughly speaking it&#8217;s a major ingredient in the Universe we live in. </li>
<li><strong>Varying constants</strong>. Physical constants are warm and fuzzy. We don&#8217;t know why they have the value they have, but we always substitute them into our equations and formulas, relying on decades of scientific research behind us, and the fact that they are, well, constants. However, there&#8217;s a fairly determined group of scientists that is looking into certain scientific constants and finding that their values have changed as the Universe aged. Determined might be an understatement, as anyone willing to travel to Gabon and mess with uranium there is certainly dedicated. What they&#8217;re finding is that the constants describing nuclear reactions were different two billion years ago compared to current constants. </li>
<li><strong>Newton&#8217;s inverse square law</strong>. In 1994 scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory figured out they had a bug with Pioneer probes. Contrary to the Newton&#8217;s inverse square law, the Pioneers were drifting off course. They hired Slava Turyshev out of Jet Propulsion Lab to investigate the small bug, which was most likely to blame on some contamination or error in Pioneer design. 14 years later the bug still stands unresolved. Together with NASA the scientists have gone through heaps of papers figuring out what could go wrong, and the answer is still up in the air. If unresolved, the Pioneer trajectory might become the first evidence that it&#8217;s time to rethink Newton&#8217;s inverse square law. </li>
<li><strong>Homeopathy</strong>. When it works, you hear all about it. Homeopathy is almost like religion, in the sense that it attracts either staunch believers, or extreme sceptics. The idea of diluting a certain ingredient with copious amounts of water doesn&#8217;t sit well with the majority of chemists, who point out that such small proportions call for a chance of the entire solution being water. Nevertheless, in Brooks&#8217; book there&#8217;s an attempt at the explanation of what might be causing homeopathic effect - changes in molecular structure of water depending on the chemicals that it&#8217;s been in contact with, even if the chemicals have been filtered out. However, it&#8217;s still an attempt at best, since the scientific experiments that do achieve positive results are generally not reproducible. </li>
<li><strong>Placebo effect</strong>. Perhaps related to the previous thing we don&#8217;t understand, placebo effect has some interesting features. The patient knowing or suspecting that they might be receiving a placebo behaves differently than those without any knowledge. Are we comforted by the sight of people in white robes and our local pharmacist dealing out the regular dose of medication? Or does body start producing entirely different set of hormones with mind suspecting that the recovery process is near. Placebo, if figured out, might become a huge money saver with the current drug prices, and hence attracts scientific research. The only thing missing? A definitive conclusion on the placebo effect. </li>
<li><strong>Free will</strong>. A certain amount of human ideology rests on the idea of free will. So the idea of the body just reacting to some responses outside of the brain is uncomfortable. But picture this. You&#8217;re in bed, it&#8217;s time to get up, yet you want to spend a few more minutes in bed. Your conscious mind is sending the signals for the body to get vertical, and yet at some point, probably between the thoughts of pending shower and commute to work, you get up. The final decision done by something unconscious, something you don&#8217;t really have control over. While your conscious mind can submit an application to this unknown organ and request something happening, the body movements and behavior are triggered by something that is still largely unknown for science. </li>
<li><strong>Cold fusion</strong>. It became one of the most ridiculous scientific ideas to get associated with, and no scientist would touch it nowadays with a 40-foot pole, since it brings the stigma. However, as some point out, peer pressure is pathway to missing out on some potential innovations in the field. What&#8217;s currently reproducible is the effect of cold fusion on a plastic called CR39. Placed by a piece of depleted uranium, CR39 shows similar patterns of radiation as placed into a cold fusion experiment. </li>
<li><strong>Life on Mars</strong>. The Viking probes were declared to contain no evidence of life on Mars. The only person in the room who disagreed with the announcement was a bacteriological researcher, who came up with a clever idea of detecting life (fart reference coming soon). By adding radioactive isotopes to the nutrients fed into the foreign soil, the researchers would get any evidence of carbon-based life to produce gas (there it is), and by the virtue of having the food injected with isotopes, the Geiger counter would go ballistic, and hence you could validate existence of life in the soil, even if other tests came negative. </li>
<li><strong>WOW signal</strong>. One would argue that scientists at SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) have a pretty monotonous job. They&#8217;re waiting for a signal on 1420 MHz frequency. Why 1420? That&#8217;s the frequency of hydrogen, the most prevalent element in the Universe, so hopefully those extra-terrestrials will arrive at the same idea when sending the signal. So far no signal has arrived. Except on August 15th, 1977, when the signal came. It was very distinct, and caused Jerry Ehman to write &quot;Wow!&quot; on the margin of the printout. The signal never repeated, and the SETI folks have not heard anything similar since then. </li>
<li><strong>Mimivirus</strong> is an interesting virus that does not seem to affect humans, except for the unique cases, when it actually does. It&#8217;s the virus that fight cancer cells among others, and hence draws a great deal of research attention. </li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong>. If you&#8217;ve read this far, here&#8217;s a bonus entry. Yes, sex is one of those things that scientists do not quite understand (insert a proper nerd joke here). Looking at overall picture, the animal kingdom provides a great variety of alternative means of reproduction, that are much more efficient as far as number of offspring and the quality of gene preservation. A number of reptiles and fish are all-female or all-unisex species, copying themselves for the purposes of reproduction. Moreover, a number of species, like water fleas, can reproduce either sexually or asexually. You&#8217;d think that the species produced through asexual reproduction would be somehow inferior to the ones that appeared as a result of a sexual act, but there&#8217;s no solid scientific data to prove that or the opposite. What remains enigmatic is that if asexual reproduction would provide you with 2x the population compared to sexual (and that leaves out the time and energy spent on finding a mate, taking her to dinners and consequent ring shopping), why didn&#8217;t the entire animal world switch to asexual, as it&#8217;s obviously a more efficient process. </li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/08/friday-morning-shipping-update.html">Netflix outage this week</a> I was thinking about getting <a href="http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsytheblog/2008/05/20/NetflixInstantPlayerTheNextTVApplianceForUs.aspx">their Vudu appliance</a> for instant on-demand streaming to a TV set. But then, it seems that those appliances are just interim products, till we move to something better, sort of like CD-ROMs. </p>
<p>The better in this case is wireless HDMI. Since Netflix already supports streaming part of their catalogue to your PC, it&#8217;s just the matter of time till you can get that stream in high-def, and then plug in a wireless HDMI adapter to stream it directly to the television, bypassing a settop box entirely.</p>
<p>A limited selection of wireless HDMI products on the market is pretty pricey nowadays compared to a box from Vudu sold through Netflix. A <a href="http://www.gefen.com/kvm/dproduct.jsp?prod_id=4318">set of extenders from Gefen</a> is currently $700. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9986973-7.html">Belkin Flyware HDMI transmitter</a> is also $700. Hopefully the pricing would follow the <a href="http://www.dvdfile.com/news/special_report/features/timeline/timeline.htm">DVD player timeline close enough</a>.</p>

I wasn&#8217;t there, but he posted the slides for everybody to follow. Here&#8217;re some lessons learned.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define the scalability goals for your application</strong>. If you don&#8217;t know how many requests you&#8217;re shooting for, you don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;ve built something that works, and how long it&#8217;s going to last you. </li>
<li><strong>Measure everything</strong>. CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, requests per second, with the last one being the most important. If you don&#8217;t know the baseline, you don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;ve improved. </li>
<li><strong>Design your database with scalability in mind</strong>. Assume you&#8217;ll have to implement replication. </li>
<li><strong>Do not rely on NFS for code sharing on a server farm</strong>. It&#8217;s slow and it&#8217;s got locking issues. While the idea of keeping one copy of code, and letting the rest of the servers load them via NFS might seem very convenient, it doesn&#8217;t work in practice. Stick to some tried practices like <a href="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/rsync-overview">rsync</a>. Keep the code local to the machine serving it, even if it means a longer push process. </li>
<li><strong>Play around with I/O buffers</strong>. If you&#8217;ve got tons of memory, play with TCP buffer size - your defaults are likely to be set conservatively. See your tax dollars at work and use this <a href="http://acs.lbl.gov/TCP-tuning/linux.html">Linux TCP Tuning guide</a>. If your site is written in PHP, use <a href="http://www.php.net/outcontrol">output buffering functions</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Use Ram Disks for any data that&#8217;s disposable</strong>. But you do need a lot of available RAM lying around. </li>
<li><strong>Optimize bandwidth consumption</strong> by enabling compression via mod_deflate, setting zlib.put_compression value to true for PHP sites, or Tidy content reduction for PHP+Tidy sites. </li>
<li><strong>Confugure PHP for speed</strong>. Turn off the following: register_globals, auto_globals_jit, magic_quotes_gpc, expose_php, register_argc_argv, always_populate_raw_post_data, session.use_trans_sid, session.auto_start. Set session.gc_divisor to 10,000, output_buffering to 4096, in John&#8217;s example. </li>
<li><strong>Do not use blocking I/O, such as reading another remote page via curl</strong>. Make all the calls non-blocking, otherwise the wait is something you can&#8217;t really optimize against. Rely on background scripts to pull down the data necessary for processing the request. </li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t underestimate caching</strong>. If a page is cached for 5 minutes, and you get even 10 requests per second for a given page, that&#8217;s 3,000 requests your database doesn&#8217;t have to process. </li>
<li><strong>Consider PHP op-code cache</strong>. This will be available to you off-the-shelf with PHP6. </li>
<li><strong>For content sites consider taking static stuff out of dynamic context</strong>. Let&#8217;s say you run a content site, where the article content remains the same, while the rest of the page is personalized for each user, as it has My Articles section, and so on. Instead of getting everything dynamically from the DB, consider generating yet another PHP file on the first request, where the article text would be stored in raw HTML, and dynamic data pulled for logged-in users. This way the generated PHP file will only pull out the data that&#8217;s actually dynamic. </li>
<li><strong>Pay great attention to database design</strong>. Learn indexes and know how to use them properly. InnoDB outperforms MyISAM in almost all contexts, but doesn&#8217;t do full-text searching. (Use <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">sphinx</a> if your search needs get out of control.) </li>
<li><strong>Design PHP applications in an abstract way</strong>, so that the app never needs to know the IP address of the MySQL server. Something like &#8216;mysql-writer-db&#8217;, and &#8216;mysql-reader-db&#8217; will be perfectly ok for a PHP app. </li>
<li><strong>Run external scripts monitoring the system health</strong>. Have the scripts change the HOSTS if things get out of control. </li>
<li><strong>Do not do database connectivity decision-making in PHP</strong>. Don&#8217;t spend time doing fallbacks if your primary DB is down. Consider running <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/proxy-gettingstarted.html">MySQL Proxy</a> for simplifying DB connectivity issues. </li>
<li><strong>For super-fast reads consider SQLite</strong>.&#160; But don&#8217;t forget that it&#8217;s horrible with writes. </li>
<li><strong>Use Keepalive properly</strong>. Use it when both static and dynamic files are served off the same server, and you can control the timeouts, so that a bunch of Keep-alive requests don&#8217;t overwhelm your system. John&#8217;s rule? No Keep-alive request should last more than 10 seconds. </li>
<li><strong>Monitor via familiar Linux commands</strong>. Such as <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/iostat">iostat</a> and <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vmstat8.html">vmstat</a>. The iostat command is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates. The iostat command generates reports that can be used to change system configuration to better balance the input/output load between physical disks. vmstat&#160; reports&#160; information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and cpu activity. </li>
<li><strong>Make sure you&#8217;re logging relevant information right away</strong>. Otherwise debugging issues is going to get tricky. </li>
<li><strong>Prioritize your optimizations</strong>. Optimization by 50% of the code that runs on 2% of the pages will result in 1% total improvement. Optimizing 10% of the code that runs on 80% of the pages results in 8% overall improvement. </li>
<li><strong>Use profilers</strong>. They draw pretty graphs, they&#8217;re generally easy to use. </li>
<li><strong>Keep track of your system performance</strong>. Keep a spreadsheet of some common stats you&#8217;re tracking, so that you can authoritatively say how much of performance gain you got by getting a faster CPU, installing extra RAM, or upgrading your Linux kernel. </li>

Clark dedicates an entire chapter to fair trade coffee practices, that I wasn&#8217;t too familiar with, but as anybody else, assumed it was a Good Thing. Fair trade coffee practices, controlled by a non-profit <a href="http://www.transfairusa.org/">TransFair USA</a>, pay farmers participating in the program $1.26 a pound for regular coffee, and $1.31 for certified organic. Under the fair trade label it&#8217;s resold to you at $12-15 a pound, making the retailer quite a winner in this transaction (originally fair trade was supposed to eliminate the middleman, and thereby lower the final cost of coffee).</p>
<p>When the price of coffee beans can occasionally go under 40c, this seems like a good deal, if you&#8217;re a coffee farmer, so what&#8217;s the catch?</p>
<ol>
<li>Fair trade contracts are binding, and requiring the coffee bean farmers to commit to $1.26-$1.31 even if market surges (as it does when there&#8217;s a cold summer in Brazil). Ok, this is a bit hypothetical, but coffee markets <a href="http://www.ico.org/prices/p2.htm">have been known to swing wildly</a> nevertheless. In 2006 Starbucks (the largest seller of fair trade coffee in the US) has actually paid its non-fair-trade growers an average of $1.42 per pound. Oops.</li>
<li>TransFair requires that each coffee farm participating in the program be coop-owned and employ no outside seasonal labor. This rules out private farms, family-owned farms, and corporation-owned farms. A family of coffee bean growers starts out a farm, hires seasonal labor to pick the beans, and wants to sell it as fair trade coffee? TransFair doesn&#8217;t let those capitalist pigs get anywhere near the application form. </li>
<li>Roasters admit that fair trade coffee is of inferior quality. While the rest of the coffee farms have to compete in lower-priced open market, they frequently do it by quality of their product. When a fair trade farm is guaranteed $1.26-$1.31 a pound, the economic rationales start to take over, and growers always try to cut their costs to enjoy higher profit margins. </li>
<li>TransFair requires every participant in the fair trade program - retailer or coffee grower - to sign a release form promising never to criticize the program in public. </li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2007 HitWise <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004083.php">published the findings</a> that 1% of searchers conduct 13% of searches, and hence these power searchers became the coveted audience among the search startups. Most of them try to get to the 1% through some sort of rewards club. <a href="http://club.live.com/Pages/Home/HomePage.aspx">Live Search Club</a> promises prizes in exchange for the searches conducted on Live.com.</p>
<p><a href="http://scour.com/invite/prostoalex">Scour</a> now combines Google, Yahoo! and Live results into a single interface, and pays out 1 point for searching, 2 points for rating a search result in a Digg-style manner, and 3 points for commenting on a search result, hinting at some attempt at social search. What do points get you? 25k points equal a $100 gift card, half of that is a $50 gift card, and 6,500 points equal a $25 gift card.</p>
<p>I was always happy to sell my Firefox searchbox to a highest bidder, and used to use Blingo, where I even won some movie tickets occasionally. Lately Blingo dropped Google search results, and substituted them with a combo of paid ads and organic results from Yahoo! and Live (bad idea because of paid links appearing in top 3 results for anything), so Scour looks like the next best thing to come after that. Currently <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/scour.com">34,000ish rank on Alexa</a>, but climbing quite fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://scour.com/invite/prostoalex">Sign up through my referral</a>, if you&#8217;re interested. The results pages seem to be clean, although navigating to the results page is always accompanied by a frame that has the ratings widget.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I applauded Rep. Jackie Speier&#8217;s first bill, introducing <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/07/11/MNNP11N0G7.DTL">a nationwide speed limit of 60 in urban areas and 65 in not so urban areas</a>. After I was done applauding, I was left wondering why would Rep. Jackie Speier pander to the interests of car and gas lobby, and not be more resolute as a junior Congresswoman.</p>
<p>While 60 is a nice first step, 0 mph speed limit would deliver the ultimate efficiency, and allow Americans to save a lot more money on gas. Scientists have shown that a great variety of vehicles, even Cadillac Escalades, break mileage records when driven at 0 mph. Driving cars at 0 mph can save up to 100% of gas expenses of an average American family.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but agree with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;There is no need to wait for OPEC or the oil companies to help us out,&quot; Speier said. &quot;Every driver can effect change simply by easing up on their right foot.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congressperson Speier is not afraid to speak the truth, and tell it like it is. As drivers, we should all reduce our oil dependency and stick it to OPEC by easing up the right foot, moving it one pedal to the left, tapping it slowly, then tapping it some more until the vehicle achieves complete stop.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both Northwest and United airlines today took time from their busy schedules to send me an e-mail urging to visit <a href="http://www.stopoilspeculationnow.com/">StopOilSpeculationNow</a>, and craft a letter to my respective Congressperson, asking The Man to stop, well, oil speculation, and moreover, do it now (or by next weekend, if they&#8217;re too busy). The site teaches you what speculation is all about, and an unbiased opinion suggests speculators are buying oil future contracts in large quantities, therefore driving the price of crude oil up.</p>
<p>I am glad the issue is clear-cut, like the Batman movies. On one hand you have the evil guys, represented by oil speculators, on the other ones you have the noble truth-seekers, i.e., large airlines.</p>
<p>I was ready to fire up the typewriter, when the liberal media influenced my fragile mind yet again. None other than <strong>CNN Money</strong> insists that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/27/news/economy/The_onion_conundrum_Birger.fortune/">markets with future contracts actually are less volatile</a> than those without futures (and speculators):</p>
<blockquote><p>The volatility has been so extreme that the son of one of the original onion growers who lobbied Congress for the trading ban now thinks the onion market would operate more smoothly if a futures contract were in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oops, I guess a lot of companies buy futures to hedge their bets against prices going up, not to encourage price increases. <strong>The Economist</strong> also <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11670357">takes a look at the commodities and futures markets</a> blame game that&#8217;s unveiling, and introduces us to the concepts of supply and demand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speculators do play an important role in setting the price of oil and other raw materials. But they do so based on their expectations of future trends in supply and demand, not on whims. If they had somehow managed to push prices to unjustified heights, then demand would contract, leaving unsold pools of oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what&#8217;s causing the airline industry to react so viciously against crude oil futures trading. Perhaps we&#8217;re due for another price hike on airline tickets, and knowing the effort to stop crude oil futures would fail, airlines are conveniently setting up the scape goats.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best editors for Windows - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/">Notepad++</a>, just hit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=843201">a 5.0 release</a>. If you&#8217;ve never heard of it, it&#8217;s a source editor for Windows written with Win32 APIs (and none of that .NET slowness that accompanies all of the latest apps) with syntax highlighting, code folding, and a few other features developed via plug-ins (such as FTP folder synchronization and HTML find-and-replace).</p>
<p>New version features a whole bunch of improvements to the typeaheads for popular languages, and auto-completion, common features for IDEs. Previously it matched opening and closing braces, now it matches opening and closing tags in XHTML. There are a few speed improvements, but since the editor was so fast before, I didn&#8217;t notice the incremental improvements.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://highscalability.com/behind-scenes-google-scalability">High Scalability blog</a> (a great addition to any RSS reader out there) there&#8217;s a link to <a href="http://research.google.com/people/jeff/index.html">Jefrrey Dean</a>&#8217;s presentation on MapReduce usage in Google. Actually, his presentation touches upon a few aspects of Google infrastructure, such as GFS, and BigTable, so there&#8217;s more <a href="http://research.yahoo.com/node/2135">on this video</a>. What caught my eye is the relative growth of MapReduce inside Google - 2.2 mln jobs run in September 2007.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-right-width: 0px" src="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image-thumb.png" border="0" alt="image" width="504" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>In the table above, note the drastic growth of input data analyzed and output data generated. The number of actual MapReduce jobs has also grown significantly and reached 10,000 in September 2007.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image1.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-right-width: 0px" src="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image-thumb1.png" border="0" alt="image" width="504" height="302" /></a></p>
<p>Dean also presented an interesting graph about the frequency of commits of new MapReduce jobs into the repository - as you can see there are months when the number of new projects goes through the roof, followed by a spike.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-right-width: 0px" src="http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image-thumb2.png" border="0" alt="image" width="504" height="271" /></a></p>
<p>The reason? Summer interns.</p>
