			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness02.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />As the <a title="Sufring the Internet Boosts Aging Brain" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/does-the-internet-boost-your-brainpower/">New York Times reported</a> recently, surfing the internet boosts brain activity. Scientists from the UCLA specifically studied the effect of internet surfing on the brains of people between the ages of 55 and 76. From their results, they concluded that &#8220;emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults.&#8221;</p>
<p>But anyone can do something for their brain&#8217;s fitness. Here&#8217;s a small selection of things you can do online:</p>
<h2>1. Search the internet</h2>
<p>Apparently, searching the internet requires decision-making and complex reasoning, which is a challenge for the brain and keeps the respective key centers in a top notch condition. But instead of using Google all the time, try something new. There are hundreds of search engines out there and you&#8217;ll find some of these have been <a title="Search Engines" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tech-fun/search/?cx=009717636731598800244%3Aqhe4rh7wuxs&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=%22search+engines%22&amp;sa=Search#1072">covered on MakeUseOf</a>. Don&#8217;t be lazy, give them a chance!</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t do without Google, at least try another interface, such as <a title="Sputtr" href="http://www.sputtr.com/">Sputtr</a> for example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/coolsearch04.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>2. Read blogs</h2>
<p><img style="margin-left:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness03.png" border="0" alt="" vspace="5" align="right" />But don&#8217;t stick to the same old, variation is what counts. So discover and read a new blog every week, for example by following links in Blogrolls or from interesting comments. You can also search randomly or by category using the <a title="Find Blogs" href="http://www.findblogs.com/">Find Blogs</a> search engine. There is quite a selection to enjoy. Interestingly, MakeUseOf is not listed&#8230;shame on them!</p>
<h2>3. Read news</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness04.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />And not just those that are obvious. Try to find out about what&#8217;s going on in another country. Keeping the brain active is all about feeding it with information. Not just any information, but rather things you have a natural interest in, including things you may find difficult to understand at first. News is a door opener to many topics, for example politics, international relationships, history, landscape, the local food or language.</p>
<p>I am not going to recommend any mainstream site as I&#8217;m sure you all know CNN and the BBC and whatnot. For a bit of a different view in 43 languages, try <a title="World News" href="http://www.wn.com/">World News</a>. And remember, if you were not curious about anything at all, you would not be reading this in the first place!</p>
<h2>4. Play games</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness07.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Games where you have to use your mind that is! Sudoku, crossword puzzles, riddles, all great ways to challenge the mind. But after some time you&#8217;ll need to increase the difficulty or switch to another stimulus to avoid monotony.</p>
<p><a title="Braingle" href="http://www.braingle.com/">Braingle</a> is an excellent source for different brain teasers! Besides that, the trivia, games and community, I found the Mentalrobics section very inspiring. Within the categories creativity, vocabulary, memory, and stress you&#8217;ll find lots of useful information on how your brain works and how you can take advantage of that, for example to master stress.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness09.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />Also have a look at <a title="Games for the Brain" href="http://www.gamesforthebrain.com/">Games for the Brain</a> for a broader spectrum of games in different languages. Other than the same old, there is Guess the Flag, Crime Scene where you have to identify people, Memocoly where you memorize colors, and many more. The twist is that while you&#8217;re playing games, an IQ score evaluates your achievements.</p>
<h2>5. Can you raed, Tihs?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Ins&#8217;t it urtlety cnosufnig waht the mnid can do? We otefn do not raielze jsut how mcuh our biran is cabalpe of. Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it dseno&#8217;t mtaetr in waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it whotuit a pboerlm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Azanmig!</p></blockquote>
<p>And the truth is, recruiting the potential your mind actually has is key to brain fitness. So never tire to try new things, especially if they may seem difficult. Maybe you can even see the 3D image in this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness05.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>For more 3D Stereogram Images and other illusions check out <a title="Eyetricks" href="http://www.eyetricks.com/">Eyetricks</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Socialize</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness10.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />Interactions with other people stimulate the brain. Even if these interactions happen online. So if you&#8217;ve been avoiding social networks (like myself), pull yourself together and give it a try. Everyone will <a title="Socialize on MUO" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tech-fun/search/?cx=009717636731598800244%3Aqhe4rh7wuxs&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=social+network&amp;sa=Search#1393">find a community</a> they can benefit from. Who knows whom you will meet, the world is only a fingertip away. And besides, connecting with other people brings happiness. The challenge is to figure it all out!</p>
<h2>7. Listen to music</h2>
<p>On MakeUseOf we have shown you tons of ways to <a title="Discover Music" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tech-fun/search/?cx=009717636731598800244%3Aqhe4rh7wuxs&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=discover+music&amp;sa=Search#1317">discover music</a>. While most music recommendation engines go by what you already like to suggest new things, to stimulate your brain cells you should actually try to listen to something completely different. Use your newly developed social skills and follow the musical likes of random strangers. Did you know music can trigger emotions?</p>
<h2>8. Learn a language</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness11.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />When you <a title="Learn Languages on MUO" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tech-fun/search/?cx=009717636731598800244%3Aqhe4rh7wuxs&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=learn+language&amp;sa=Search#1391">search MakeUseOf for &#8220;learn language&#8221;</a> you&#8217;ll find several websites that will teach you foreign languages for free or in a community based setting, where you can teach someone else at the same time.</p>
<p><a title="One Minute Language" href="http://oneminutelanguages.com/">One Minute Languages</a> is a new one that has not been covered before. With all the things we have to pack into our lives today, One Minute Languages gives you an opportunity to sneak peek into a language. There are ten lessons to each language and each lesson is only a few minutes long. So it&#8217;s actually more than a minute, who would have thought!</p>
<p>Once you have completed the ten lessons you&#8217;ll be far away from actually speaking that language. However, you may be encouraged to study it in depth. And nothing is more challenging for the brain than to learn, speak and think in a foreign language. Think big, but start simple.</p>
<h2>9. Make her turn the other way around&#8230;</h2>
<p>Is she turning clockwise or counter clockwise? Try to make her turn the other way around. It really works, but don&#8217;t interpret too much into it!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness01.gif" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>10. Learn more!</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness06.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />If all of this made you curious about your own brain, check out <a title="Sharp Brains" href="http://www.sharpbrains.com/">Sharp Brains</a>, a website that provides plenty of brain-related information. As &#8220;the brain fitness authority&#8221; they present the latest news and research on brain-related matter, including studies on exercises, improving memory, stress management and they feature interviews with the leading experts in the field.</p>
<p>Other websites to consider are <a title="The Brain From Top to Bottom" href="http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/index_a.html">The Brain from Top to Bottom</a> and <a title="Your Amazing Brain" href="http://www.youramazingbrain.org/">Your Amazing Brain</a>, both of which offers detailed background information in Wiki-How style. The Brain from Top to Bottom is especially fascinating. You can select your level of understanding from beginner to advanced, learn about the brain from different points of view, even in French and I just love the overall concept of the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brainfitness08.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Taken together, the secret of brain fitness is to constantly challenge the brain. Doing crossword puzzles or playing Sudoku is great, but in the long run it&#8217;s monotonous. To keep your brain fit, you should learn something new every day. What did you learn today?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the fastest growing online art forms is the web comic.  Web comics can really break up your boring day and give you a little something to look forward to.  Now you&#8217;re probably familiar with some of the greats out there like <a href="http://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">XKCD</a>, but here are a few of my personal favorites to add a little variety to your list.</p>
<p>For more great web comics, <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-webcomics-you-should-read/">check out Part 1 of this series</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/">Questionable Content</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/qc3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This web comic has been around for a <strong>LONG</strong> time.  Jeph Jacques&#8217; fantastic strip about the lives of some coffee shop dwellers is one of the top web comics on the net today.  There is quite a bit of backstory, but the gist of it can be picked up with some limited browsing.  It&#8217;s amazing how funny and original Jacques manages to be every day of the workweek.  He&#8217;s also very social on Twitter, updating <a href="http://twitter.com/jephjacques">his account</a> frequently.  On top of that he&#8217;s made special accounts for each of his characters.  Their conversations are like bonus material!  Find them in the list of people he follows.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.sinfest.net/">Sinfest</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sinfest.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I only discovered Sinfest a little while ago, but I&#8217;ve been pretty impressed with it.  It&#8217;s a spunky comic about a bunch of walking stereotypes (and their pets) as they navigate the landscape of the modern American psyche.  A lot of the episodes have a political slant (not favoring anyone too particularly), but it&#8217;s much more a commentary about modern day capitalism than an overt political admonition.  Plus, it&#8217;s pretty funny and very wacky!</p>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> For some reason Sinfest isn&#8217;t equipped with a native RSS feed&#8230;so <a href="http://page2rss.com/page?url=www.sinfest.net/">I made one</a>!  You can thank me later.</div>
<h2><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/">PhD - Piled High and Deeper</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/phd2.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This one is a bit more selective.  PhD is aimed specifically at students going through graduate school.  That being said, just about anyone who&#8217;s gone through college or stayed through academia will probably love it.  The world of scholarly research is full of hypocrisy, wonderful moments, and crushing defeats.  As a prospective grad student myself, I&#8217;ve actually learned a lot about what life is really like for those in limbo between academic worlds.  I&#8217;d read up on some of the background info though, it will make the comic a little more coherent.</p>
<h2><a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/">UserFriendly</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/uf.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ah UserFriendly.  This sardonic little comic sometimes gets a little too angsty for my taste, but that&#8217;s to be expected.  It&#8217;s about the plight of IT support employees.  Their jobs are often frustrating and thankless and this comes across pretty well in the comic.  That being said, the stories are full of demons, corporate hotshots, and every variety of geek, so there&#8217;s something in it for everybody!</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.freakangels.com/">FreakAngels</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/fa.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">FreakAngels is a bit of a weird one.  I threw it on here because I know there is a nice chunk of you who get excited when the words &#8220;steampunk&#8221; and &#8220;post-apocalyptic&#8221; get used in the same breath.  FreakAngels tells the story of a group of misfits who have taken up the task of caring for their town after the end of the world.  They have unique and fantastic powers that grow stronger when they are together.  It comes out about once a week in serial format, so each week reveals something new about the FreakAngels&#8217; mysterious past.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s your favorite comic strip on the web?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/youtubetesttube.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="10" align="left" />I wanted to write about this feature back when I wrote about <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/improve-your-youtube-videos-with-testtube-features/" target="_blank">YouTube&#8217;s &#8220;Video Annotations&#8221;</a> .  But I couldn&#8217;t get it to work and I thought at the time that it was a US-only feature.   But it has now appeared and I&#8217;ve discovered that it is a great feature for people wanting to put music on their uploaded YouTube videos.   OK, you&#8217;re not going to get Shakira or Bono rocking to your wedding video but there is still a lot of great music clips available for you to add to your uploaded YouTube videos - and it&#8217;s all free.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of reasons why you would want to add music to your videos.   For a starter, music can add to the atmosphere of the piece.    Imagine a bird soaring through the sky, a man and a woman kissing, Leo and Kate standing on the bow of the Titanic&#8230;.or you&#8217;ve simply said something embarrassing about your relative&#8217;s waist size and you want it cut out before they cut YOU out of their will.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, you can now have the video soundtrack easily removed and have it replaced with a soaring uplifting melody, a funky pop song, a headbanging rock and roller or some relaxing classical tune.</p>
<p>So as usual, here&#8217;s MakeUseOf to guide you through how to do it :</p>
<h2>1. Decide which video you want to replace the audio for</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/audioswap3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Log into your YouTube account and go to your videos.    Find the video you want to replace the audio for and in the options, you&#8217;ll find a button called &#8220;AudioSwap&#8221;.   Click on that little baby right there.</p>
<h2>2.  Decide which music you want</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/audioswap1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is harder than it sounds.    There are literally LOTS to choose from - LOTS of songs and LOTS of artists in LOTS of genres.    You really are spoilt for choice.    Just skimming over the list, you can have Alicia Keys, Cranberries, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.   As I said, no Shakira shaking her hips or Bono with his sunglasses but you can&#8217;t have everything you want in life.</p>
<p>If you want the song to end when your video ends, you can filter the songs down to &#8220;only show songs of similar length to my video&#8221;.</p>
<p>So just scroll through them all, click what you want and you can preview each song before you finally make your selection.   When you have made your selection, just click the &#8220;publish&#8221; button underneath your video and your video will be re-uploaded to YouTube along with the selected music.    The previous soundtrack will be deleted permanently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/audioswap2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As an intended example, I tried changing the soundtrack to my Rudy video which I used for my annotations article.  I changed the soundtrack to a rock song called &#8220;Therapy&#8221; by &#8220;Finger Eleven&#8221;.   But it is taking quite a long time for YouTube to &#8220;process my request&#8221; to change the soundtrack and re-upload my video - in fact I am still waiting <strong>24 hours later!</strong> So you need to bear that in mind when doing your own.   Don&#8217;t expect immediate results.   Be prepared to wait in a long line.</p>
<p>Have you used YouTube AudioSwap?   If so, what music did you use for your videos?    What do you think about the whole service?   Worth using?   Have you had your videos done sooner than 24 hours?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/picture-19.png" alt="&gt; border=" vspace="10" align="left" /><a href="http://www.skyfire.com/" target="_blank">Skyfire</a> is an exceptional free, mobile browser that delivers rich web media right to your mobile phone. The latest and recently updated version has just been made available to the public. This mobile browsing software is incredible. It allows you to play Flash content, video playback and utilize Ajax, with the support of Silverlight, Quicktime, and Windows Media.</p>
<p>Skyfire has been mentioned to be not as quick and &#8220;cunning&#8221; as <a href="http://www.operamini.com/" target="_blank">Opera Mini</a> once you start browsing. However it allows for a much quicker viewing of videos on sites such as Youtube with impressive tempo. One of the major differences between the two mobile surfing giants is that Opera Mini requires the use of JavaScript in order to start up - this can easily interfere with loading speeds.</p>
<p>A new feature this version assumes is the &#8220;Super Bar&#8221; and &#8220;predictive text&#8221;. Whenever a keyword is typed in anywhere within the browser, the Super Bar searches for this word and returns with a defined word or a synonym. This feature seems much like the one Opera and Chrome browsers have adopted. With Skyfire if you come across a page you’d like to share or send to a friend via SMS, with two simple taps within the menu, a pre-filled text appears on your screen with the specified URL content.</p>
<p>With this new release you&#8217;re also able to save images, download files, and in addition Skyfire can now be set as a default browser.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/skyfire_predictive1.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="right" />Since Skyfire is in Beta there <strong>are </strong>a couple of bugs. Some things I wasn&#8217;t quite fond of when browsing were that if Skyfire lost service as I browsed, then I would have to completely restart the browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another bug I found consisted of the fact that Skyfire currently does not support Pocket Internet Explorer bookmarks.  If you would like to import your current bookmarks from Pocket Internet Explorer to Skyfire, then for the time being you&#8217;re unable to. We expect Skyfire&#8217;s developers and programmers will address this issue soon enough before its final release. However, besides these tiny bugs, Skyfire has proven to be a fast media-enriched browser.</p>
<p>When Skyfire views Flash content, it can possibly take anywhere from 2-3 seconds in order to update the screen and the video may freeze as well.  However this is still by far a supreme addition to the bundles of mobile browsers available.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/skyfire-21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here is a quick graphed comparison placing Skyfire an Opera Mini in contrast with both of their loading times for the designated pages, as well as which applications they support:</p>

<p>Here is a video of the browser operating.  Even though the interface is more or less the same, this is a bit of an older version. One of the largest updates within the newer version consists of performance gains but keep this in mind when watching.</p>

<p>The changes and updates made to the new version of Skyfire allow it to become more stable and &#8220;rock&#8221; the mobile browsing community.  However, it seems as though it has quite a bit of time before it can supersede the many expectations of the Opera Mini fans.</p>
<p>Do you use, or have you used, Skyfire?   How do you think it compares to Opera Mini or any other mobile browser?   Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps3_saves_01.jpg" alt="ps3 game saves" vspace="5" align="left" />One of the main advantages of PS3 (apart from the great graphics and insane processor power) is its accessibility.</p>
<p>The XrossMediaBar (XMB in short) was first used for the PSX. At the moment it&#8217;s the user interface system for both the PSP and the PlayStation 3. Although we&#8217;re still far away from the customizability we have <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-downgrade-your-psp-upgrade-to-a-custom-firmware-part-two/">on the PSP</a>, it&#8217;s a big step forward, coming from the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>This accessibility is really demonstrated when we&#8217;re copying to or from the PlayStation 3. Not only movies or pictures, but savegames as well.</p>
<p>Some of you might remember the hassle of copying or backing up a savefile on the PlayStation 2. This was possible, but only from and to other memory cards. If you wanted to use these savefiles through a computer, additional products had to be purchased. Special Memory Cards, Memory Card to USB converters, and so on.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation 3 this becomes much easier. Not only can we make swift backups to various storage media, it&#8217;s also easy to share, or download savefiles using the internet.</p>
<h2>Method 1: Full Backup</h2>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no easier way to secure your save-files than by doing a full fledged back-up.</p>
<p>One of the downsides is that it really is a one-click-backup, meaning you can&#8217;t select specific parts or use it for anything other than to put it back later, which then erases all the other content.</p>
<p>Doing it is pretty simple though. Just make sure you&#8217;ve got a flash drive, external hard disk or one of the supported memory cards at hand. Make sure you&#8217;ve got enough room on it before you try backing up your entire HD film collection.</p>
<p>If you want to do a more specific backup, or learn how to place downloaded savefiles <em>on</em> your PlayStation 3, check <em>Method 2</em> below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong><em>Settings</em> -&gt; <em>System Settings</em></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps3_saves_03.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</li>
<li>Scroll down and select <em><strong>Backup Utility</strong></em> and choose <em><strong>Backup</strong></em>.</li>
<li>You will see two warnings, one will tell you that you can&#8217;t backup Trophies, the other one is a regular affirmation form. <strong>Confirm both times</strong>.</li>
<li>Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for the <strong>destination</strong>. You can use any flash drive or external hard disk, just make sure you&#8217;ve got enough space available.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps3_saves_02.jpg" alt="backup ps3" /></p>
</li>
<li>Wait for the process to finish, and you&#8217;re done. Once you&#8217;ve put the backup somewhere safe, you can sleep soundly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you want to restore the backup, go back to Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Backup Utility and select &#8220;restore&#8221;. Once you&#8217;ve told your PlayStation where to look, your files will magically fall into place, but know that all the other files on the PlayStation 3 will be deleted!</p>
<h2>Method 2: Manual Backup</h2>
<p>If you want to have a bigger say in the backup process, you can always try doing it manually. The method described below will work for all files (videos and pictures alike), but we&#8217;re going to look specifically at the save files.</p>
<p>The process is pretty simple. Just insert your storage drive and follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><em>Game -&gt; Saved Data Utility</em></strong>. This is where all your saves are stored.</li>
<li>Browse to the right savegame and press <strong>triangle</strong> ( <img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/15px-playstationtrianglesvg.png" alt="" /> ). And select <strong>Copy</strong> in the newly opened sidebar.</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps3_saves_04.jpg" alt="ps3 saves" /></p>
<li>You&#8217;ll be prompted for the destination. Any external storage drive will do (like a USB stick or a memory card), save games aren&#8217;t so very big. Additionally, you can also transfer the save game to another user account.</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps3_saves_05.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<li>Wait for the copying to finish, and you&#8217;re done!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>These savegames can be easily transfered from and to other media. You can store them on your PC, mail them to friends, and so on. The posibilities are endless.</p>
<h2><strong>Putting The Saves Back In Place</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to copy a savegame <em>to</em> your PlayStation 3, you&#8217;ll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><em>Game -&gt; Saved Data Utility</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Way at the top you&#8217;ll see your storage drives. Click on the one you need.</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps3_saves_06.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<li>Just like before, select the desired savegame and press <strong>triangle</strong> ( <img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/15px-playstationtrianglesvg.png" alt="" /> ). Then select <strong>Copy</strong> in the sidebar and choose to copy to your PlayStation 3&#8217;s hard drive.</li>
<li>Wait for it to finish copying, and you&#8217;re done!</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Downloading Save Games Online</strong></h2>
<p>There are a lot of good sources for PlayStation 3 save games. Most of these saves are 80 to 100 percent completed and some have various unlocked extra&#8217;s. These can be downloaded and copied to your PlayStation 3 with the method described above.</p>
<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/gamefaqs.jpg" alt="gamefaqs" align="left" /><a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">GameFaqs</a> is a great website for all kinds of video game info. This is the place to go if you want release dates, cheats or walkthroughs. Even savegames!</p>
<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/logo.jpg" alt="" align="left" /><a href="http://ps3.brewology.com/?page=savedgames" target="_self">PS3BREW</a>, part of the Brewology network, hosts a wide range of PlayStation 3 savefiles. It&#8217;s definately worth checking out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/domains.jpg" alt="" vspace="5" width="252" height="313" align="left" />What&#8217;s in a domain?</p>
<p>When building your new website or blog - having the best possible domain is a key factor that adds to your success.    When selecting a domain, people generally will take the following factors into account :</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to remember.</li>
<li>Standardized spelling (except for this whole Web 2.0 thing).</li>
<li>Keyword rich (though this generally only applies to professional marketers).</li>
<li>Represents and creates an image of your site or product.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is well known that dot.com is the gold standard in domains with everything else coming after.   However with all of the crazy TLDs out there, it is possible to create cool blends in order to gain branding.   Look at <a href="http://www.last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> or <a href="http://www.current.tv" target="_blank">current.tv</a> if you need to know more.</p>
<p>So the actual act of finding that domain is a perilous process to be sure.    You could go to a registrar and keep typing in names and searching until you come up with a match.   OR you could use one of these great tools and get creative.</p>
<h2><a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Instant Domain Search</a></h2>
<p>This one is my personal favorite and I use it to quick check any domain I think of on the fly.   It will search out domain availability as fast as you can type for .com . net and .org</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great for brainstorming sessions where you need to check lots of domains within a short period.   Even better, it has quick links to <a href="http://www.whois.net/" target="_blank">whois</a> and other information for quick lookup.</p>
<p>Similar to this is <a href="https://domize.com/">Domize</a> which lists out less character spellings of the search as well and has an iPhone app.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/instantdomainsearch1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a href="http://geek.name">Geek.Name</a></h2>
<p>A very strange and very useful service that creates a constant stream of available domain names that you can sort via certain criteria.   Great for explorations and getting new ideas as it incorporates various TLD&#8217;s in its creations</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/geekname.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.domainsbot.com/">DomainsBot</a></h2>
<p>This is a very useful brainstorming application which lets you type in a word or phrase and it searches related and synonyms.  You can get some pretty good filtering and suggestions if you turn off &#8220;for sale&#8221;  in the search results</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/domainbot.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a href="http://bustaname.com">BustaName</a></h2>
<p>Previously <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/bustaname-quickly-generate-search-domains/">covered in detail on MakeuseOf</a>, BustaName allows you to combine various words, prefixes and suffixes and check domains on the fly to find that perfect match.</p>

<h2><a href="http://xona.com/domainhacks/">Domain Hacks</a></h2>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, a Domain hack is using either sub-domains or unusual TLD to create a word out of the domain.   Probably the most famous domain hack was del.icio.us which was actually registered as the domain www.icio.us and then added a subdomain.    This tool by Xona allows you to search for a word or domain and it will recommend various hacks to get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/domainhacks.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.moniker.com/domains/registerdomainnames.jsp">Obscure TLD registrations.</a></h2>
<p>Old hands will have their preferred register of choice, but others won&#8217;t know where to go to register that obscure TLD from Micronesia.   Who to use is your preference, but I like the Moniker registration as they have over 140 TLD&#8217;s ready to search and register with just a few clicks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tlds1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finding that perfect domain is like sifting through an antique store looking for that Van Gogh.   It is there and can be found.    Remember that the value of a domain is not in how much it is appraised at, but rather what you can do with it.</p>
<p>To that end, we would like to ask our readers if there are other cool domain search tools out there that we have missed.   Leave your answers in the comments section!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/girtitle.png" alt="" vspace="5" align="left" />Image hosting sites such as Flickr or Photobucket are still far and away a couple of the most popular of their kind on the web.  However, as much traffic as they receive, the most popular way of searching the web quickly for a particular photo or graphic, is Google Image Search.</p>
<p>However, Google&#8217;s implementation of their product, although usable, feels very clunky and can be extremely cumbersome, combing through hundreds of thousands of images.  Fortunately it seems like there is always another way with technology.</p>
<p>A strangely titled website called &#8216;Dear Computer&#8217;, takes the incredibly large index of <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/browse-through-history-with-magazines-photo-archives/">Google Images</a> and simply displays images only, nothing else.  They have titled it &#8216;<a href="http://dearcomputer.nl/gir/">Google Image Ripper</a>&#8216;, and what it does is it removes the long drawn out process of individually clicking images through Google&#8217;s annoying search, and displays the file in its entirety.</p>
<p>Here is a comparison look:</p>
<h3><strong>Google&#8217;s Default Image Search of MakeUseOf:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/muogi.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>Dear Computer&#8217;s Google Image Rip of MakeUseOf:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/muogir1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As you can see after submitting a search, you get many more images and a much easier interface, than you ever would with Google&#8217;s version.  Once the images are displayed, you then have the ability to simply right-click on the file right from the screen, for easy saving and storage.</p>
<p>Along with the quick search and save feature, you also have some additional options to choose from while searching.  You still have the option of choosing between sizes (small, medium, large and extra large) but also an additional &#8216;icon&#8217; option as well.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the search box.  Here is where you can select your image size, safe content option or even look for &#8216;faces only&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/muogir2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Along with the website, I have incorporated Firefox&#8217;s built-in keyword searching as well.  If you bookmark this link- <a href="http://dearcomputer.nl/gir/?q=%s">Google Image Ripper</a> - you can simply type &#8216;im <em>insert image name here</em>&#8216; and you&#8217;ll quickly see Image Ripper&#8217;s display of images.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t much else to this web app, but I find myself using it on almost a daily basis, particularly for icons and smaller images.  It also comes in handy when you would like screen shots of a particular application for a blog posting or software review.  You may not find a use for it yourself, but just try it out anyway.  It&#8217;s incredibly fast and of course free to use.</p>
<p>Do you know of any similar online products?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zscreenhead.jpg" border="0" alt="" vspace="10" align="left" />I have tried many different screen capture programs and the same thing always seems to be true.  If it&#8217;s free it sucks and if it costs money it&#8217;s mildly better.  But I have found a great screen capture utility with a wealth of options that coincidentally is also FREE! As in free beer!</p>
<p>This program called <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/zscreen/ZScreenSetup-1330.exe">ZScreen</a> was exactly what I was looking for.  Zscreen can still function like &#8220;print screen&#8221; using &#8220;alt&#8221;+&#8221;print screen&#8221; to grab the active window but that is where the similarity ends. Zscreen has the ability to auto-upload your image to <a href="http://imageshack.us/">Image Shack</a>, an ftp or shoot your image to a pre-associated image program like Paint or Photoshop. This is a great tool for a blogger, web designer or an avid web surfer that likes to share what they find. You can see the <a href="http://brandonz.net/">authors home page here.</a></p>
<p>Simply load this application up by downloading the 847KB installer. Run it and you will be greeted by a control panel-like screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zscreen1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are a lot of controls and settings but out of the box Zscreen captures with the print screen button and automatically uploads the image and creates an image shack URL that you can use.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zscreenimageshack.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Not enough features for ya? They&#8217;ve got more!</p>
<p>How about cropping a portion of a web page or your screen using the Zscreen? That&#8217;s right, no more print screening and then cropping in Photoshop!</p>
<p>Simply hit &#8220;control&#8221; and &#8220;print screen&#8221;. You will get an arrow that will let you draw a box around what you want to copy to your clip board.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zscreencrop.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Or if you are like me and need to save screen shots for later use, you might want to save individual files automatically and deal with them later. No problemo, just go back to your options and pull down that same drop down menu where you had selected &#8220;Image Shack&#8221; or &#8220;FTP&#8221; and choose &#8220;File&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>The options that configure what the file is called would be found under the &#8220;File Settings&#8221; tab. Check it out.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zscreenfilesettings.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even think I&#8217;ve scratched the tip of the iceberg that is this screen capture program. But I can safely say that it fits into my work routine lovely! I have a feeling that I will be using it for some time to come!</p>
<p>What do you, the MakeUseOf reader, use for screen capturing?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google-toolbar-logo.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="5" align="left" />The <a href="http://toolbar.google.com">Google Toolbar</a> is a great way to extend your browser.  It includes a lot of useful buttons, and the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/buttons/gallery">button gallery</a> has even more if the default buttons don&#8217;t meet your needs.   But what if the button gallery does not have something you&#8217;re looking for?  Fortunately, creating a custom search button for the Google Toolbar is quick and easy!</p>
<p>The other day, I created a <a href="http://geeklad.com/google-toolbar-reader-button">search button for Google Reader</a>, because surprisingly enough it doesn&#8217;t come with one and the button gallery doesn&#8217;t have one either.  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/author/mark/">Mark O&#8217;Neill</a> has already put together a <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/put-makeuseof-on-your-google-toolbar/">search button for MakeUseOf</a>, and I&#8217;ve made use of it myself quite a bit.  For demonstration purposes, let&#8217;s pretend he didn&#8217;t make one and you&#8217;d really like to have one.  Here&#8217;s what you would do to create a custom search button for MakeUseOf:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com">MakeUseOf homepage</a></li>
<li>Right-click inside of the search field.</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/browser-right-click-menu.png" alt="" /></p>
<li>Left-click on the menu item that says &#8220;Generate custom search…&#8221;</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/add-custom-button.png" alt="" /></p>
<li>You&#8217;ll see the &#8220;Google Toolbar Custom Button Generator&#8221; automatically load in the page title, icon (if the site has one), and display the URL as the description.  The description is what is displayed in the tooltip when you move your mouse over the button, so you might want to change it to something more descriptive like <em>Search MakeUseOf</em>.</li>
<li>Click Add and you&#8217;re done!</li>
</ol>
<p>The new button will appear on the toolbar with a yellow box around it to highlight the new button.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/new-toolbar-button.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The search button that Mark created also includes the MakeUseOf RSS feed as well.  You can learn <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/toolbar/buttons/apis/started.html#rss">how to add an RSS feed</a> in the <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/toolbar/buttons/apis/index.html">Google Toolbar API</a> documentation.  The API docs contains additional information on how to create more advanced buttons.</p>
<p>Do you use the Google Toolbar in your browser?  Have you created any custom buttons you found were lacking?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/afloat-mac.png" alt="" vspace="5" align="left" />I have to admit: I love large screens. I envy anyone working on 30&#8243; Cinema Displays, opening several Safari windows and arranging them so that everything is laid out before them.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that large screen-estate enhances productivity, it&#8217;s not a myth. With that said, browsing and working on my 13&#8243; MacBook isn&#8217;t a bed of roses.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hardest when I have to work with multiple documents because it gets extremely difficult to view everything at a glance, especially if I have to cram them onto my tiny screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only an indigent student so getting a larger external display isn&#8217;t an option, unless you&#8217;re offering to donate one. Up until a few days ago, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html">Spaces</a> was kind of the only method I knew of to pseudo-increase my screen-estate. Then I bumped into Afloat and was surprisingly pleased.</p>
<p>Afloat doesn&#8217;t do anything to increase the number of desktops I have or affect the amount of screen space either. No, it does something slightly different although amazingly intelligent - it changes the way we manage our application windows. By allowing a combination of transparency, pinning windows on top or on the desktop and making them act as an overlay; it has helped me to overcome some of the major issues I had to deal with.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/afloat-options.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Before I go any further, I have to elaborate that Afloat will <strong>only work with Cocoa applications in Leopard</strong>. Unfortunately, Carbon applications like iTunes and Finder aren&#8217;t getting any love. However, this may all change when Snow Leopard is released since it is <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/10/28/mac-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard-cocoa-finder-and-64-bit-changes/">purported to be fully-Cocoa</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going &#8220;Huh?&#8221; at the terms &#8216;Cocoa&#8217; and &#8216;Carbon&#8217;, don&#8217;t fret. I was once in your position,  regular users like us probably don&#8217;t realize that there are several <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/architecture/index.html">different frameworks</a> crunching their gears behind the scenes of OS X. To learn more, check out this article from Macworld on <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/21535/2001/01/macosx.html">Carbon versus Cocoa</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/afloat-transparency.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now back to the subject.  Afloat adds the ability to make application windows transparent so that you can see through it into the window below. It may not sound like much but on a small screen, it does wonders. Imagine yourself trying to type out some text from a photo (a snapshot from a Powerpoint slide, for example) and you have to constantly switch from image viewer to the text editor. By setting the image editor as an overlay (Overlay is a feature whereby the application window is set to appear transparent, is always on top and isn&#8217;t affected by clicks), you can now place the image viewer directly over the text editor and type away.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/afloat-translucency.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, Afloat can keep certain application windows above all others. This can be useful when you&#8217;re trying to keep track of something, making the application viewable at all times even when you switch between several other programs. There is no way to do this natively in OS X.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/afloat-effects-settings-2.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Afloat can also pin your application window to the desktop so that it appears beneath the desktop icons and all other opened windows. This is useful when you want to&#8230; be able to pin a window to the desktop? Using Exposé to Show Desktop will actually reveal any window which is pinned there. The only problem occurs when clicking on desktop icons: the clicks actually fall through to the application window below, if there is one. So slight arrangements are necessary to make this work properly.</p>
<p>Overall, Afloat has made life easier for me in cases when I had multiple applications opened and needed to refer to several of them at once. But then again, I wouldn&#8217;t be having this problem if I could afford a larger screen. If only.</p>
<p>Like always, <a href="http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/">Afloat</a> is free and was developed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_ISV">µISV</a> called infinitelabs. So if you like the program, donations are greatly appreciated.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sites built to share your files are, as they say, a dime a dozen. Sites that will let you share larger files, which may be several GB in size, are not nearly as common. Having scoured the Web (as well as <a href="http://makeuseof.com/dir" target="_blank">our own site directory</a>) for candidates, I&#8217;ve narrowed them down to four ridiculously simple services which will have you swapping movies - I mean, perfectly legal Creative Commons-licensed videos - in no time.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.zapr.com" target="_blank"><strong>Zapr</strong></a> (Windows XP only)</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zaprmainwindow.png" border="0" alt="zaprMainWindow" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/zapr-share-files-desctop/">Zapr</a> is, in essence, a small Web-server that sits in your system tray. Instead of leaving your entire machine open, you select what files are to be served, and can password-protect them as you see fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zaprfileselect.png" border="0" alt="zaprFileSelect" /></p>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I have uploaded a compressed ZIP file of the most-recent Editors&#8217; Picks from open-licensing music site <a href="http://www.ccmixter.org" target="_blank">CCMixter</a>. The selection process was as simple as opening a file in any Windows program. Next step was to select the privacy level. Once that&#8217;s done, your selected file is instantly available for download, either as a public link from <em>username</em>.zapr.com, or as a private link you can send to select friends and colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zaprsharefile.png" border="0" alt="zaprShareFile" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zaprsharingspace.png" border="0" alt="zaprSharingSpace" /></p>
<p align="left">No other uploading is required as the files are served directly from your PC. This means no file-size or bandwidth limits. Of course, this also means that for your friends to get at the files, you must leave your PC on with the Zapr client running. As long as that&#8217;s not an issue for you, then Zapr is the fastest and easiest internet file-sharing solution I&#8217;ve seen for Windows users.</p>
<p align="left">Moving on now to the Web-based fare.</p>
<h2><a href="http://fileai.com/" target="_blank"><strong>FileAI</strong></a></h2>
<p align="left">FileAI works much like Zapr, but consists of a Java-based in-browser client. Any platform that supports Java should work with FileAI. There is no size or bandwidth limit, much like with Zapr, because the files are again served directly from your PC.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/fileaisharing.png" border="0" alt="fileAiSharing" /></p>
<p align="left">Downloads can be password-protected and also limited by how many times a file can be downloaded before it expires. FileAI promises &#8220;Bit-Torrent-style&#8221; distributed file transfers among multiple recipients. Downloading a file is as easy as visiting the site and entering a transfer-ID number or clicking a direct link. The Java client handles all transfers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/fileaireceiving.png" border="0" alt="fileAiReceiving" /></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/filedropper-store-share-large-5gb-files/" target="_blank"><strong>File Dropper</strong></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/filedropperupload.png" border="0" alt="fileDropperUpload" /></p>
<p align="left">File Dropper claims to be the fastest file-sharing site, and it certainly is fast. It can&#8217;t be much simpler. Upload a file of up to 5GB in size and receive a download link to pass to your friends. Uploads start immediately upon choosing the file. The site will try and up-sell you on its new premium services, but most of us will find the quick and signup-free basic service to be sufficient.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.fileshaker.com" target="_blank"><strong>File Shaker</strong></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/fileshakerupload.png" border="0" alt="fileShakerUpload" /></p>
<p align="left">At first glance, File Shaker looks a lot like File Dropper, just a bit more colorful. File Shaker offers the same quick, login-free, basic upload service, with the maximum file-size bumped-up to a whoppin&#8217; 10GB. Upload time for the same ZIP file was about equal to File Dropper.</p>
<p align="left">For a dead-simple 10GB upload, you can&#8217;t beat the price, although given File Dropper&#8217;s push for premium accounts, I would not be personally surprised if File Shaker drifted towards the same business-model.</p>
<p align="left">There you have it. The four easiest solutions I could find for sharing files both large and small. I certainly could have missed out on a few gems, so commenters, please let me know what I&#8217;ve missed. I won&#8217;t take it personally.</p>

<p>It is interesting to watch this web niche evolve. Social media has brought a new generation of green resources. You can now be a green news source yourself (by participating in green social networks), become a part of huge green communities (by frequenting environmental blogs) or even watch green news using Twitter!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at a few examples of new creative environmentally friendly resources to help you go green.</p>
<h2><strong>User-Generated Green News:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dotherightthing.jpg" alt="I Do The Right Thing" width="600" height="365" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dotherightthing.com/" target="_blank">I Do the Right Thing</a></strong> is a user generated resource where &#8220;<em>you can get unfiltered information about the   impacts of companies on</em>&#8221; the environment.</p>
<p>The green stories are rated based on the <a href="http://www.dotherightthing.com/static/popup/ratingscale.html" target="_blank">impact</a> they produce on the society and/or environment. The process of voting for the story is as follows: you should define the impact to be positive, negative or neutral.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/youtubeuserpagecorner.png" border="0" alt="" vspace="10" align="left" />Earlier this year, I took the plunge and bought a camcorder.   I haven&#8217;t had much of a chance to do much filming yet due to work commitments but I am determined to change all that in 2009.   So in the past couple of weeks, I have been sprucing up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/camelot2302" target="_blank">my YouTube user page</a> in anticipation of all the videos I intend to upload in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Doing so has made me realise all of the customization options I never knew existed up to now and you can spend literally ages tweaking it and twunking it (I think I&#8217;ve just invented my own word) the way you want it.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at some of the things you can do to make your YouTube user page your own.</p>
<p>The first step (of course) is to make your YouTube account.   Then, once you are logged in, your user page can be found at http://www.youtube.com/user/<strong>YOUR USER NAME</strong>.   As you can see from the screenshot above, the box at the top left hand corner of the page has a yellow &#8220;edit channel&#8221; button.   Click that to find the customization options available to you.</p>
<p>The three options are :</p>
<h2>Channel Info</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/youtubeoptions1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s highly recommended that this is filled out properly as this information is indexed in the search engines.  So make sure the description and the tags are done properly.</p>
<h2>Channel Design</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/youtubeoptions2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is the most important option of all.   This is where you can specify the colours of your page or specify a background design.  You can also rearrange the layout of the boxes on your page, specify which video will show at the top of your page and much more.</p>
<p>Now many users may choose to have a default plain colour on their page but did you know that you can upload another wallpaper as your background?   Jimmy recently <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-bunch-of-easy-ways-to-spice-up-your-twitter-page/" target="_blank">talked about Twitter wallpapers</a> and you can use those same wallpapers on your YouTube page as well.  Just upload your wallpaper in the &#8220;advanced design customization&#8221; section, choose &#8220;repeat background image&#8221; and bingo, you&#8217;ve got yourself a nice background.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth taking a lot of time over this option until you get things exactly the way you want it.   You can change the font, the playlists that are displayed, the boxes that are displayed, the colour of the links and the colour of the text.</p>
<h2>Organize Videos</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/youtubeoptions3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This option is not so important in my opinion.   All it does is allow you to rearrange the order of your uploaded videos so you can move certain ones to the front.   So if you have a video that you would like to display more prominently, you can bring it forward.    But if you don&#8217;t care, you can give this option a miss.</p>
<p>So these are the three options that YouTube offers you to customize your page.   If you spend some time working on these options, you&#8217;ll be amazed at how great your page looks afterwards.</p>
<p>What customizations have you done to your YouTube page?   What tips and tricks can you offer to people looking to spruce up their page?    Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/winlogoscrn.jpg" alt="" align="left" />You have seen pipes, the Windows logo and even slideshows of photos as computer screensavers. How about the prospect of using your family videos (or anything else for that matter) as a screensaver?</p>
<p>Well there is a tool from Microsoft that allows you to do just that. Its called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=6405ff4f-9bc4-40dd-aa30-ed4ffe02baac&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft Video Screensaver</a>.</p>
<p>The download requires you to verify the genuineness of your copy of Windows.  Once that is done, the installation is simple and a breeze. You can then access &#8220;Video Screensaver&#8221; from the &#8220;Display Properties&#8221; box and then hopping over to the &#8220;Screen Saver&#8221; tab.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/screenpropvscrn.png" alt="" width="404" height="455" /></p>
<p>Select &#8220;Video Screensaver&#8221; from the drop down list and click on &#8220;Settings&#8221; to choose the video you would like to play. You can choose to play the included default video giving you a view of countries all over the world (kind of lame to be frank) or you can choose your own videos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/videoscreensavervscrn.png" alt="video screensaver" width="459" height="446" /></p>
<p>Just put all the videos you would like to play in a separate folder if you don&#8217;t already have one and point the settings dialog to it. That&#8217;s it. You now have a video screensaver waiting for your computer to get idle! I tried the tool with wmv and avi files and it seemed to work flawlessly with both of them.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, now what  if you want to get Windows Vista Dreamscene functionality (animated or video wallpapers) ? For similar functionality you can try DreamsceneXP. <a href="http://dreamscenexp.co.nr/">Dreamscene XP</a> gives you 7 dreamscenes in a variety of resolutions. Follow the following steps to get it running :</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the dreamscene of your choice.</li>
<li>Extract to any location, Open up display properties and browse to the extracted location and click on index.htm.</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dreamvscrn.png" alt="" width="404" height="455" /></p>
<li>Click &#8220;apply&#8221; and presto you have an animated background!</li>
</ol>
<p>While Dreamscene limits you to 7 choices, you can use another option  (actually  more of a hack) to play any of your videos as the desktop background. You can use <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC media player</a> to play a video file in the background as wallpaper.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the video you want to play as background, or optionally create a playlist if you want to play more than one.</li>
<li>Once up and running, right click within the player and check wallpaper.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t get the wallpaper option go to Settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Video &gt; Output Modules &gt; Direct X and check &#8220;Enable Wallpaper Mode&#8221;</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/settings1vscrn.png" alt="" width="510" height="447" /></p>
<li>Also you might want to enable repeating playlist by default so that the background doesn&#8217;t turn black after the video finishes running. For this go to Settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Playlist and check &#8220;Repeat All&#8221;</li>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/settings2vscn.png" alt="" width="510" height="447" /></p>
</ol>
<p>There you have it - a video as your desktop background. If the taskbar button bothers you and you want to get rid of it, try something like <a href="http://www.whitsoftdev.com/trayconizer/" target="_blank">Trayconizer</a>. Since VLC supports a multitude of formats you can use virtually any file as the background.</p>
<p>You may also like to try the <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-desktop-enhancements-you-should-see/">previously mentioned methods</a> of using any of your screensavers as the desktop background.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other application that offers a similar functionality? Or have you used the desktop background or screensavers creatively in other ways?  Let us know in comments</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings05.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Television is passé. But TV shows are not!</p>
<p>The internet has opened up a range of new ways to experience TV and to enjoy shows whenever you want.</p>
<p>Alongside, the web also provides possibilities to discover shows, catch up on previous episodes and connect with fellow fans.</p>
<p>We went out to find the best online episode guides for you. Naturally, these sites supply much more material, for example airdates, background information or social components.</p>
<p>Have a look at what we picked&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. <a title="LocateTV" href="http://www.locatetv.com">LocateTV</a></strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings06.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />LocateTV is superior because it takes advantage of many features the internet has to offer.</p>
<p>From the frontpage you can search for TV shows, actors and movies, see what&#8217;s hot, directly access new seasons and episodes summaries, browse TOP 5 lists and a lot more. Users from the US, UK and Ireland can set their local TV provider to view personalized airdates.</p>
<p>From a show&#8217;s dedicated page you can see when it will run on TV, whether it&#8217;s available on DVD, discover where you can watch it online and of course view the episode guide. The best part is that you can discover new TV shows and movies based on your picks.</p>
<p>All components are integrated with ease of use in mind. Personal picks and settings are saved through cookies and the site doesn&#8217;t offer a membership. However, you can share your favorite programs and actors with friends through a URL or embed a series or an actor on your website or profile. LocateTV also offers a search bar addon for Firefox and IE.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings07.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>2.</strong> <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode_guide"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a></h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings02.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Wikipedia is an excellent source for all sorts of information. Hence, it comes as no surprise that it also has tons of material in store on TV shows.</p>
<p>But the link above will not simply take you to Wikipedia&#8217;s start page. Instead you&#8217;ll land at the &#8220;List of television series episodes category&#8221; from where you can further specify your search. Of course you can always search for a show directly.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be alarmed by the many (0)s behind the subcategories. These numbers merely denote the number of sub-subcategories and by no means indicate how many series have been listed under the respective subcategory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings01.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Wikipedia has to be the most practical database. Unfortunately, the A-Z list of all TV shows appears to be out of date, so one always has to go through the subcategories to browse and discover new series.</p>
<h2><strong>3.</strong> <a title="Television Without Pity" href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/"><strong>Television Without Pity</strong></a></h2>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings09.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />This site is different! It&#8217;s hilarious and offers tons of extras besides providing excellent recaps, i.e. episode guides. Humanoid humor absolutely required for mental digestion!</p>
<p>The amount of shows is limited, but includes all the hottest and latest TV productions. Additionally, each show has its own forum where members can discuss various topics. Beware of spoilers and mean comments!</p>
<p>US users will appreciate the TV listings, some shows have their own blog and members can edit the Wiki. There is a lot to discover on Television Without Pity and it&#8217;s a bit overwhelming and maybe even disturbing at times. But browsing the site is great entertainment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings10.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Runners Up</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings03.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" /><a title="EPGuides" href="http://epguides.com/menug/">epguides</a> &amp; <a title="TV.com" href="http://www.tv.com">TV.com</a> together run a huge database of over 4,100 TV shows. On epguides, each show has its own page with basic information and a list of seasons and episodes. A detailed episode guide including summaries is usually provided through TV.com. From the frontpage of epguides you can search shows or browse from A-Z or by topics. All updates are made through TV.com. However, even though TV.com is way more advanced than epguides.com, providing a membership option and the possibility to add changes, epguides is easier to navigate if you&#8217;d like to browse shows randomly.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/tioti01.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />We have previously <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/socialize-your-television-experience-with-tioti/">reviewed</a> <a href="http://www.tioti.com/">Tioti</a>. It&#8217;s a social media platform for television shows, with a touch of Wiki-ness. On Tioti you&#8217;ll find information, links and ways to to interact with fellow TV lovers. You can log in using your Facebook account.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tvshowlistings08.png" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" /><a title="SideReel" href="http://www.sidereel.com/">SideReel</a> is similar to LocateTV also offering a forum for discussion and thus also a site membership. Members can add information, such as reviews, links, news or discussions. It&#8217;s a very interactive site. However, the episode guides aren&#8217;t thorough and are usually linked in through other sites, which makes them difficult to use.</p>
<p>We have previously reviewed services that let you view your favorite shows online!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago we looked at <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/email-to-sms/">how to send emails to cell phone as SMS for free</a>. Lots of people found the article quite useful. Today I wanted to extend it a bit further and show you how you can use the info from the previous post to setup alerts for important emails that land in your Gmail account.</p>
<p><img src="http://makeuseof.com/images/gmail-alert-sms-3.png" alt="Gmail SMS" /></p>
<p>The whole thing is fairly simple. I am pretty sure some of you have been using it already.</p>
<p>First you need to get free <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/email-to-sms/">email to SMS gateway for your mobile carrier</a>. If you didn&#8217;t get it last time you can easily do so now. The page lists email-to-sms gateways for 10 major US carrier and lots of international ones.</p>
<p>Once you have the email for your mobile number (say <em>1234567890@tmomail.net</em>), simply login to your Gmail account and go straight to Settings -> Filters tab. Now, there are two ways to use this. </p>
<h2>1- Get SMS Alerts for Emails from Specific Addresses</h2>
<p>The first way is to setup SMS alerts for emails coming from certain people or places that you consider important. These can be emails from your employer, bank, hosting provider, site uptime tracker etc. </p>
<p>Create new filter and enter the email address for which you want to receive SMS alert. </p>
<p><img src="http://makeuseof.com/images/gmail-alert-sms-1.png" alt="Gmail SMS alert setup" /></p>
<p>In the next step, setup a Forward rule to your free email-to-sms number.</p>
<p><img src="http://makeuseof.com/images/gmail-filter-sms-2.png" alt="Gmail SMS alert" /></p>
<p>Click on &#8220;Create Filter&#8221; and you&#8217;re done. Next time you receive email from that address you&#8217;ll also get SMS message with about first 150 characters of the email. As simple as that.</p>
<h2>2- Get SMS For Urgent Emails If You&#8217;re Away</h2>
<p>Say you&#8217;re on holiday and don&#8217;t want to be bugged with regular work related emails. However at the same time you want to make sure that when it&#8217;s something really urgent people can reach you. </p>
<p>Here is what you can do. First create an auto-responder message (see in Setting -> General) that looks something like the one below.</p>
<p><img src="http://makeuseof.com/images/gmail-sms-responder.png" alt="Gmail SMS alert" /></p>
<p>Then go to &#8216;Filters&#8217; tab and setup a forward filter for it. As you can see, in the above auto-responder message I provided sender with option to reach me by simply emailing me again using &#8220;urgent&#8221; in the subject line.</p>
<p><img src="http://makeuseof.com/images/gmail-sms-6.png" alt="gmail sms notification" /></p>
<p>As soon as email hits my inbox I get texted to my mobile.</p>
<p>Are you using anything similar to that right now? Share with us in comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pb_services2.jpg" border="0" alt="" vspace="10" align="left" />Have you noticed your digital life getting out of hand recently?  Do you have too many feeds from too many services?  Well you could cut back on the networks that you subscribe to, but that&#8217;s no fun.  Hopefully this handy webapp will help you get it all back under control again!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/"><strong>PeopleBrowsr</strong></a>, a clunkily-named service if ever there was one, is deceptively useful.  Essentially it is an aggregator for your social networks. PeopleBrowsr organizes different lists into columns that can be moved around horizontally. Even though you&#8217;re in a webpage, you&#8217;ll swear you&#8217;re using a desktop app with all the Ajax in the interface (relieving you of the need to reload your page).</p>
<h2><strong>It handles the following services:</strong></h2>
<p>* Twitter<br />
* Flickr<br />
* YouTube<br />
* Seesmic<br />
* identica<br />
* LinkedIn<br />
* Digg<br />
* Photobucket<br />
* Facebook<br />
* and FriendFeed</p>
<p>The overall interface is a bit hard to describe from scratch, so here&#8217;s a visual:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pb_all2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The core of the service is a three-column interface that is completely customizable. By default, Twitter is the primary account, so all the options will be Twitter-centric at first. I believe that you MUST have a Twitter account to use the service at all, though I&#8217;m sure that once this moves out of alpha, that will change.</p>
<p>When viewing any particular service (in the above case, Twitter is selected), you will have a list of available windows to add on. Twitter, for instance, has &#8220;Everyone,&#8221; &#8220;Following,&#8221; and &#8220;Directs.&#8221;  Each of these will come up in their own separate column that can be scrolled to if more than three are on the screen.</p>
<p>In order to switch to another service, run your mouse over the PeopleBrowsr logo and select one of the services that pops up. Changing services will change the color palate of the template.  From there you can choose new columns and add them to those of the other services.  For instance, my screenshot above has <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Digg</strong>, and <strong>YouTube</strong> all on the same page.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pb_account2.jpg" alt="" vspace="10" /></p>
<p>If you want to get rid of the menu bars, click the tiny &#8220;X&#8221; button in the upper-right corner. This is very handy for maximizing your screen real estate.  Note: To get back to the standard view, click the little white arrow in the upper corner. It can be a bit hard to find.</p>
<p>Clicking on either your own profile or someone else&#8217;s will bring up a profile window. This is very handy because you can quickly investigate any user and see all the social networks they are a part of. Also, it can be dragged around the screen with the Ajaxy goodness that I spoke of earlier. You can see their most recent posts as well as their profile and a Gallery View of their friends across the top.</p>
<p>What is the Gallery View you ask?  Well essentially it is a pictoral version of any group of people you select on PeopleBrowsr. Here you can see the people I&#8217;m following on Twitter. What makes PeopleBrowsr nice is that you can select not only logical groups like following and followers (or friends on Digg, or followers on FriendFeed&#8230;..etc), but you can often see more complex groupings, like Top Followers and Outbox (direct messages waiting to be sent). There are even options for custom groupings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pb_allgallery.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to write an article about PeopleBrowsr, because every user will probably use a different part of it and set up their page in a totally unique way. The service will remember which columns or views you have set up so when you log into it again in the future, everything will already be there for you.</p>
<p>Right now the service is in &#8220;public alpha,&#8221; which can be translated into &#8220;tread lightly.&#8221; Often alphas are made private by developers because they don&#8217;t want bugginess to give their products a bad name. PeopleBrowsr has decided to go public, so if you do test it out, send them some feedback so they can make their beta a strong one!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mozillastorecorner.png" border="0" alt="" align="left" />My personal opinion is that Mozilla is the second most interesting web name out there, just behind the big company with the little search box. Tomorrow always brings a new thing with such organizations. A few days ago Mozilla did - just in time for the holiday season.</p>
<p>Mozilla opened its doors to the World Wide Web through its open source ‘<a href="http://communitystore.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla Community Store</a>’. An open source T-shirt designing e-store which lets you – design it…create it…own it. As the site mentions, it is the community powered sidekick to the <a href="http://store.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">earlier launched Mozilla store</a> which sells a richness of fan merchandise.</p>
<p>The community store hosts a wide variety of T-Shirt designs (last count was 145), all user generated through public participation. Mozilla’s store uses the Zazzle online storefront and its acknowledged real-view technology which allows the designers to view realistic images of their creations instantly. Technology aside, the process is very simple and there are well laid out guidelines and supporting information to help you get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Design It…</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/01_galleryb.png" alt="mozilla community store" /></p>
<p>Choose from the designs available or choose to do one of your own. Just let your creativity follow the design guidelines laid down. Your designs can be accomplished using any raster or vector drawing tools available. Submit your high resolution artwork (150dpi or more) in JPG or PNG with your own name for the credit line. The guidelines do not curb your creative instincts but ask you to imply something about Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, Camino, Bugzilla, Sunbird or Lightning in your designs.</p>
<h2><strong>Create It…</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/02_createandbuyb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The available designs can be further customized to your individual liking using Zazzle.com’s customization interface. Add text, orient your graphic or just pick the style, color and size. Zazzle has plenty of customization options.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/03-zazzleb.png" alt="design t-shirt" /></p>
<h2><strong>Own It…</strong></h2>
<p>Finished! Order your creation through the shopping cart. Zazzle.com covers about 84 countries, so the shipping should drop it off at your door. The location and pricing information is available on their website.</p>
<h3><strong>What do we get out it?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<p>We can let out that designer lurking inside you. Run riot with Zazzle’s cool customization options. The design is not limited to T-shirts alone but also to other Mozilla products. Furthermore, we can use the designs on nearly 400 of Zazzle’s merchandise.</li>
<p>We can gift a self created one-of-a-kind T-shirt to someone we love. Zazzle also has a 20% discount going till December 26th.</p>
<p>We can get a high by seeing our ‘signature’ against our creation. If someone uses our design, we do get to share our idea with the world.
</ul>
<p>And finally for those of us who are a bit of an open source rooter, it could just be a self serving proclamation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/friendconnectmain.png" border="0" alt="" vspace="10" align="left" />After many months of closed beta and keeping people waiting, <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect" target="_blank">Google Friend Connect</a> has finally gone live. This is the app that seems to be Google&#8217;s answer to Facebook, their social network that finally connects everything together. If they stick to it (unlike Lively) and put a lot of work into it, they might just give Facebook a run for their money.</p>
<p>But before you go ahead and put Friend Connect on your blog or accept any Friend Connect invitations, you need to get your Google profile together first. So let&#8217;s take a look at that. It&#8217;s worth pointing out before we start that to use Friend Connect, you do <strong>NOT</strong> need a Google account. You can sign in also with a Yahoo account, an AIM account or an Open ID account as well.   But I personally think that a Google account is the way to go here if you want to take full advantage of what Friend Connect has to offer. That&#8217;s just my personal opinion but you may think differently.</p>
<p>You can find your Google profile by <a href="http://www.google.com/s2/profiles/me?hl=en" target="_blank">going here</a> and if you don&#8217;t have a Google account, you can sign up for one if you want. Then it is just a matter of deciding what information you would like to make public and what information you would like to withhold. It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that your Google profile also shows up in your Google Reader &#8220;your stuff&#8221; section if you use Reader.</p>
<p>I would recommend making a short bio and put in some relevant HTML weblinks as this will naturally be indexed by the Google bots. So if you are a blogger or a businessperson, make sure that your website / blog is in there and linked to. This is just good SEO common sense.</p>
<p>Then the next step of the profile is linking to all your web presences, a bit like Friendfeed. But to speed this part up, I just entered my Friendfeed URL and this immediately brought up dozens and dozens of other URL&#8217;s!  So a bit of a shortcut there! Google can also &#8220;auto-detect&#8221; some of your web profiles and you can mark which ones you want on your profile and which ones it should ignore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/googleprofilelinks.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another feature of Google profiles that I like is the picture strip. At the top of the page is a &#8220;photos&#8221; sub-tab. Click on that and you can enter the URL of your web album or photo feed. Of course being Google, they prefer Picasa but it also works for Flickr or any other photo feed with a URL. I have <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/camelot2302/" target="_blank">my Flickr feed</a> running through it and it works perfectly (each picture linking directly to its Flickr page) :</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/googleprofilepictures.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>So once you have got your page all filled out the way you want it, it&#8217;s time to start accepting all those Friend Connect invitations that people may send you. Or if you have a blog, you should find the space to install Friend Connect in <strong>a prominent place</strong> (I moved the Friendfeed widget down to have Friend Connect at <a href="http://www.betterthantherapy.net" target="_blank">the top of my sidebar</a>).    </p>
<p>So what is Friend Connect all about I hear you ask? Well, let&#8217;s first get the obligatory YouTube video from Google on the matter.</p>
<p><center><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/N94s7ix0JPo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/N94s7ix0JPo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></center></p>
<p>So as you can see, this is basically Google trying to make some inroads on the social networking scene. By having FC on your blog, you can start to build a small community of visitors who can interact with one another. What&#8217;s even better is that, as the video says, there&#8217;s no need for the person to make a new account with a new profile (who wants to go through all that again?). They can also sign in with their Yahoo account, AIM account or Open ID account.</p>
<p>So what are some of the benefits for you and your site visitors?</p>
<ul>
<li>By clicking on people&#8217;s icons, you can view their Google profile and find out more about them.</li>
<li>You can contact site visitors and become friends with them.</li>
<li>You can find out what other websites people are members of with their Google profiles.</li>
<li>You can leave comments, ratings and reviews about a particular website and respond to other comments, ratings and reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in other words, Friend Connect <em>personalises</em> your site more. Gives it that human touch.</p>
<p>But it also branches out further than that. If you click on someone&#8217;s icon and view their Google profile, you can potentially see their Google Reader shared articles, their favourite shared photos, their Blogger comments, their YouTube videos and much more (if they choose to share that information with you by having it on their profile). This is in direct contrast to Facebook where you have to be approved first by the person before viewing any information of theirs. Facebook is also very much &#8220;walled in&#8221; where everything is inside and can&#8217;t be taken out of the site. Friend Connect, by contrast, seems more &#8220;looser&#8221; and you can click from site to site. Nothing seems to be constrained.</p>
<p>So I think Google is drawing a clear line here and giving users a clear choice. They aren&#8217;t offering up an identical boring Facebook clone. They are making an entirely different product where you can see the choices on offer. I like what I see so far. I just hope they don&#8217;t get bored 6 months down the line and ditch it, like a lot of other beta &#8220;Lab&#8221; products.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you installed Friend Connect? Do you like what you see? Or are you distinctly unimpressed? Do you think social networks like Facebook have cause to be worried?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/fonts-pic.jpg" alt="install-microsoft-core-fonts-ubuntu" vspace="5" align="left" /> Arial, Times New Roman, Impact and Verdana are some of the most commonly used fonts. They are so widely used in fact that whenever you open a Word document from any computer, you immediately expect to find their presence. However, on your newly installed Ubuntu (and many other Linux distros), you will find that there is absolutely no trace of any of these fonts.</p>
<p>Ubuntu, by default, does not include the commonly used Microsoft core fonts in its installation. The set of fonts that it uses is not supported in Windows or Mac. This means that if you create a document and send to your partner for editing, he/she will not be able to view it in the way that it was originally formatted. Vice versa, you won&#8217;t be able to view the document that your friend sends you in the way that it was formatted, unless he/she is using the same fonts as you.</p>
<p>Luckily, installing the Microsoft core fonts package (and any other new fonts) in Ubuntu is easy. Here&#8217;s how you can do it on your own:</p>
<h2>Installing Microsoft Core Fonts in Ubuntu Linux</h2>
<p>The Microsoft core fonts package consists of the following fonts:</p>
<ul>
*  Andale Mono<br />
* Arial Black<br />
* Arial (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)<br />
* Comic Sans MS (Bold)<br />
* Courier New (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)<br />
* Georgia (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)<br />
* Impact<br />
* Times New Roman (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)<br />
* Trebuchet (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)<br />
* Verdana (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)<br />
* Webdings</ul>
<p>To install them, open up your Synaptic Package Manager (<em>System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Synaptic Package Manager</em>). Scroll down till you find <em>msttcorefonts</em>. Check the box beside it and select <em>Mark for Installation</em>. Click <em>Apply</em> at the menubar to install the fonts package.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/install-mscorefont.jpg" alt="install microsoft fonts linux" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you prefer the terminal way, simply type the following command in your terminal.</p>
<p><em>sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts</em></p>
<h2>Installing new fonts</h2>
<p>Installing the Microsoft core fonts package is only the beginning. There will be many occasions where you need to install a new set of fonts for a specific project. Here is how you can do it :</p>
<p>If you are installing the new fonts for personal use and do not want others to have access to them, simply create a <strong>.fonts</strong> folder in your Home directory and paste all the fonts into it. Here&#8217;s the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Download the fonts (it should be in zipped format)</li>
<li>2. Extract the fonts.</li>
<li>3. Open nautilus (Places -&gt; Home). Press <em>Ctrl + H</em> to reveal all the hidden files and folders.</li>
<li>4. Check if the<em> .fonts</em> folder exist. If not, create the folder and name it <em>.fonts</em>.</li>
<li>5. Copy and paste the new font(s) into the .fonts folder.</li>
<li>6. Restart your application. The fonts should be available for your use now.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to install system-wide and allow others to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Create a new folder in your Desktop. Name it <em>newfonts</em></li>
<li>2. Download the new font(s) and extract to the <em>newfonts</em> folder</li>
<li>3. Open a terminal</li>
<li>4. Key in the command: <em>sudo cp -R ~/Desktop/newfonts /usr/share/fonts</em>. This will copy your new font(s) to the system font folder.</li>
<li>5. Restart your application. The new fonts are now available for system-wide use.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using KDE, there is a font installer application that allows you to install new fonts easily.The Font Installer application is found under System Settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kde-font-installer.jpg" alt="install microsoft fonts ubuntu" /></p>
<h2>Better Font Rendering</h2>
<p>Now that you have installed your favorite fonts in your system, here&#8217;s a simple trick to improve the font rendering and make it look nicer.</p>
<p>Open up your Appearance configuration page (<em>System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Appearance</em>)</p>
<p>Click on the Fonts tab. Under the Rendering section, check on the <em>subpixel smoothing</em> button.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/smooth-font-rendering.jpg" alt="smooth-font-rendering" /></p>
<p>You should notice the differences immediately.</p>
<p>If you are using Ubuntu 8.04 or an earlier version, this is what you need to do:</p>
<p>Type in the following command in the terminal</p>
<p><em>sudo ln -sf /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-autohint.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/</em></p>
<p>Logout and login again. You should see a noticeable difference in the font rendering.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/recuvalogocorner.png" border="0" alt="restore-deleted-files" align="left" /> We&#8217;ve talked about file recovery tools on MakeUseOf before, including one that I discussed last September in <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-securely-retrieve-and-delete-pc-files/" target="_blank">How To securely Retrieve and Delete PC files</a>.  But several friends have constantly urged me to try out <a href="http://www.recuva.com/" target="_blank">Recuva</a>, which is made and supported by the same people who created <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> (another favourite app of mine and MakeUseOf).</p>
<p>The interface of Recuva is similar to CCleaner, it is simple to use (even a computer moron could use it) and after testing it, it seems to be very effective in restoring deleted files. So I figured it deserved its own write-up on MakeUseOf.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get the short product description first of all from the <a href="http://www.recuva.com/" target="_blank">Recuva homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Recuva (pronounced &#8220;recover&#8221;) is a freeware Windows utility to restore files that have been accidentally deleted from your computer. This includes files emptied from the Recycle bin as well as images and other files that have been deleted by user error from digital camera memory cards or MP3 players. It will even bring back files that have been deleted by bugs, crashes and viruses!</p></blockquote>
<p>But as with any deleted file that you want to bring back, the older it is, the harder it will be to bring back. Plus if you are able to bring it back, the older it is, the more corrupted the file will be. So if you want to bring a deleted file back, you need to do it as fast as possible. The more you delay, the less chance there is of recovering it.</p>
<p>After using Recuva for a couple of days, I have ended up being very impressed with it. It is very fast with finding recoverable files and when you click on what you want brought back, it restores the file and sends it back to your hard drive <strong>within seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s how the program works.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> After opening the program, select the drive where the file was deleted then click the &#8220;scan&#8221; button.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/recuva1.png" alt="restore deleted files xp" /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Recuva then starts sweeping the specified hard drive looking for files that are able to be restored.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/recuva2.png" alt="restore deleted files freeware" /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> You then get a list of all the files that Recuva was able to find.  As you can see, some of the files are unidentifiable with just scrambled file names but a lot of other files have their original names intact (more on that later). What I really liked about Recuva is that it has a colour-coded system where you can see right away the status of each file and whether or not it is in any condition to be downloaded successfully or not.</p>
<p>Red means the file is basically screwed and you can forget it. Yellow means the file is in very bad condition but you can still download it and take your chances with it - some of it might be salvageable. Green means that the file is in excellent condition and you can get it back no problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/recuva3.png" alt="restoring deleted file" /></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If there are too many files returned to manage or you are looking for a particular file, you can <strong>filter the files.</strong> Just specify a file type or a file name in the &#8220;filename or path&#8221; field or drop down the menu to specify a file type.   So for example, by typing in &#8220;googleupdate&#8221;, I was able to find three particular files.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/recuva4.png" alt="restore files" /></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Now say I want to want to recover those 3 files? I just need to tick them and click the &#8220;recover&#8221; button. Recuva will ask me to specify where on the computer they should go and when I have told it, the files will start downloading. In fact, they are put back on the computer so fast that I didn&#8217;t even have time to make a screenshot!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/recuva5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically all there is to it. Just remember to untick those files in Recuva before you close the program because Recuva remembers those files next time and will keep on downloading them over and over again! So untick them once you have recovered them and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Do you use Recuva? If so, what have been your experiences with it? What percentage of files have you managed to recover using this app? Is there any particular file format in your opinion that recovers better than all the others?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/windows-logo.png" border="0" alt="" vspace="5" align="left" />There is no doubt, Microsoft is going to dominate the operating system market through Windows 7. Who knows where we will be after that. At that point we will likely be looking at some type of open source product, such as <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a>?  Maybe even we&#8217;ll move to our smart phone(s) full time?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the Windows operating system still holds dominance on the market.  With dominance though, comes much feedback and much modification from the users.</p>
<p>No matter how much you like a certain feature of Windows, there is always someone out there modifying it some way or another. This not only includes some of the integrated features of Windows, such as <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/organize-your-start-menu-with-smoz/" target="_blank">the Start Menu</a> or <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-windows-explorer-addons-for-power-users/" target="_blank">Windows Explorer</a>, but also individual applications, such as <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ditch-your-windows-notepad-for-notetab-light/" target="_blank">Notepad</a> and <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-free-image-editing-programs-for-your-pc/" target="_blank">MS Paint</a>.</p>
<p>I have put together a list of the some of the best Windows apps and feature replacements that I could come up with.</p>
<h2>1. Vista Start Menu (Start Menu Alternative)</h2>
<p>As confusing as the name is, <strong><a href="http://www.vistastartmenu.com/index.html">Vista Start Menu</a></strong> not only gets you a Vista-like Start Menu in Windows XP, but also enhances and improves the Start Menu Interface in Windows Vista.</p>
<p>It adds the ability to tab items, quick access to shutdown options, zoom capabilities and simple shortcuts to search on both the local PC and Google.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/images/start-menu-alternative.jpg" alt="Windows XP Start Menu Alternative" /></p>

* <a href="http://www.sciactive.com/main/shell-enhancements/26-open-menu-156">Open Menu+</a></p>
<h2>2. Replace Windows Taskbar with RocketDock</h2>
<p><a href="http://rocketdock.com/">Rocketdock</a> is a Windows taskbar replacement with a Mac-like feel. It&#8217;s essentially a combination of the quick launch toolbar, the taskbar and desktop widgets, all rolled into one. It looks incredibly futuristic, it has a very smooth feel, and it doesn&#8217;t eat up a lot of resources.</p>

<h2>3. ExploreXP - Windows Explorer Replacement</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.explorerxp.com/">ExplorerXP</a> is a free file manager replacement for Windows Explorer. We&#8217;ve previously written about <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/replace-windows-explorer-with-a-more-powerful-alternative/">Windows Explorer alternatives</a> in the past, but I have found ExplorerXP to be a much more stripped down version of some of its competitors, while still giving you everything you need at the same time.</p>
<p>It has built in tab ability, folder sizes, quick access to My Computer, Recycle Bin, My Docs, Desktop, multi rename tool, all running on just 410KB of size.</p>
<p>If you are looking to upgrade Windows Explorer with many must-have add-ons, while continuing to use many of its built-in capability, this is the freeware to get.</p>

<h2>4. Process Explorer - Task Manager Alternative</h2>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">Process Explorer</a> from Sysinternals is a great Windows task manager alternative to get an in-depth look at all of the running processes on your computer, including where individual executables are located, search capabilities for individual DLLs, plus a much more detailed look at system resources, and where they are being allocated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processexplorer.png" alt="task manager alternative" /></p>

* <a href="http://mkn-taskexplorer.en.softonic.com/">MKN TaskExplorer</a></p>
<h2>5. Notepad++ : Wordpad / Notepad Replacement</h2>
<p><a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a> is a much more comprehensive, in-depth textpad editor, with built-in tab ability for multiple documents, drag and drop support, color print capability, zooming, auto completion, bookmarking, and even macros.  It&#8217;s not your typical plain ole&#8217; Windows notepad or wordpad. It&#8217;s built for code writers and programmers, but used and available to all. Overall, it&#8217;s a great Notepad replacement for Windows.</p>

<h2>6. Defraggler - Faster Replacement for Windows Defragmenter</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/five-programs-to-defragment-your-pc/">Defragmenting</a> your hard drive has become an essential part of keeping your computer running at an optimal speed, and keeping your hard drive in tip top shape. It essentially takes all of the separated files on your hard disk, and pieces them back together so that everything just runs smoother.</p>
<p>Windows, for as far back as I can remember, has always had some type of defrag utility. The problem is that it&#8217;s never been that good. Fortunately with time, comes faster computers, smarter programmers and a much better interface. <a href="http://www.defraggler.com/">Defraggler</a> appears to have all of this rolled into one. It is incredibly easy to use and understand. It has an incredibly nice interface and most important, it&#8217;s incredibly fast.</p>

<h2>7. LogMeIn Free - Windows Remote Desktop Alternative</h2>
<p>I was amazed when a co-worker referred me to this website, a couple of years ago. The incredible speed, security and capability sold me from day one. The <a href="http://www.logmein.com/">LogMeIn Free</a> version lacks printing and file transfers, but if you are simply trying to access your home or work computer without ever having to touch a firewall, LogMeIn is the best way to go.  From all indications, it sounds like it&#8217;s the best free alternative to &#8216;GoToMyPC&#8217; as well.</p>

<h2>8. Replace Paint with Gimp</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> is quickly becoming a strong competitor to Adobe&#8217;s Photoshop. It comes bundled with a very similar interface, it has many of the same features as Adobe&#8217;s massive product, and it has plenty of tutorials via YouTube or blogs, to go along with it.</p>
<p>As far as a replacement for Microsoft&#8217;s Paint, I don&#8217;t think it even falls into the same category.  However, it is free, and can easily become a full-time replacement for Paint. Keep your eye out for future MakeUseOf tutorials, in regards to Gimp. We had a few <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/gimp/">Gimp tips</a> already.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are plenty of alternative options out there for many facets of Microsoft Windows.  I didn&#8217;t dive into the most obvious of items, such as Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer, but I gave a fairly in depth breakdown of many of the free replacment apps available for many different versions of Windows, but specifically for XP and Vista.</p>
<p>Do you have additional suggestions for alternatives?  Do you have more items you&#8217;d like to see replaced in Windows?  Please leave your feedback!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To those who want to give their Vista Start Menu a bit more power, there is a very useful add-on called &#8220;<a href="http://brandontools.com/content/StartPlusPlus.aspx" target="_blank">Start++</a>&#8220;.  It extends Vista&#8217;s start menu with customizable commands which gives you the ability to perform lots of actions in an instant. You can perform various kinds of searches (Google, Yahoo, Live, IMDB and Wikipedia), listen to music, view pictures and much more.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Type in <strong>&#8220;g makeuseof&#8221;</strong> and it will show the Google results in your startup Menu bar for &#8220;makeuseof&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/muo-ss1.jpg" alt="vista start menu search bar" /></p>
<p>Or type <strong>&#8220;playartist Audioslave&#8221;</strong> and it will perform a search for music for the artist Audioslave, find it, compile the results into a .M3U file and automatically play it in Windows Media player. Right now it only supports WMP but they are planning to change that soon and you&#8217;ll be able to play it in your favorite media player.</p>
<p>Wikipedia look-up is also nice. You can look up any thing that you need on Wikipedia without opening your browser. For example: I wrote &#8220;<strong>w counterstrike</strong>&#8221; and it gave me an overview of what Counter-Strike is in my start menu. Here, I&#8217;ve reduced the screenshot size to give you an idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/muo-ss3.jpg" alt="start++ vista" /></p>
<p>Basic Commands that you can run with Start++ are</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a Wikipedia search by typing &#8220;<strong>w search term</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li>Launch an application by typing &#8220;<strong>sudo cmd</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li>Play music by a specific artist with &#8220;<strong>play artist name</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li>Check out the weather by &#8220;<strong>weather zip code</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li>Search Imdb &#8220;<strong>Imdb movie name</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li>Look for any picture in your hard disk by typing in &#8220;<strong>Pic name</strong>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t end there.  You can add your own shortcuts by using its configuration UI and share them with your friends.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/images/start-addon-vista.png" alt="vista start menu tip" /></p>
<p>You can also extend the search functionality of Start++ by installing the plugins that are already available for download. <em>(Link below)</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/utorrent-mac-icon.png" alt="transmission vs utorrent" vspace="5" align="left" /><a href="http://bitrocket.sourceforge.net/">BitRocket</a>, <a href="http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/">Xtorrent</a>, <a href="http://sarwat.net/bittorrent/">Tomato Torrent</a>, <a href="http://bittyrant.cs.washington.edu/">BitTyrant</a>, <a href="http://www.bitsonwheels.com/">Bits on Wheels</a>. These are some of the torrent clients for OS X. But let&#8217;s be honest, they probably don&#8217;t sound familiar to you because they&#8217;re outshone by the two gargantuas of the torrent world, <a href="http://www.vuze.com/app">Vuze</a> (formerly known as Azureus) and <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/index.php">Transmission</a>, a lightweight but very capable torrent client.</p>
<p>Prior to switching to a Mac, Azureus has always been my torrent client of choice on my Windows PC. At that time, there weren&#8217;t many other clients for it to compete with and even though it was heavy on memory usage, I&#8217;d still prefer it over <a href="http://pingpong-abc.sourceforge.net/">ABC</a> or BitLord. Yes, it was <em>that</em> long ago.</p>
<p>After I got my hands on my first Mac, I was hoping to seek comfort in the soft familiar bosom of Azureus but I found myself sorely disappointed. I was running Tiger on a Mac Mini with 1GB of memory, so imagine what would happen if I opened Azureus, iTunes and Safari at the same time. Spinning Beachball galore. So, I turned to Transmission.</p>
<p>Back then, Transmission was still a young child yet to be nurtured. It was buggy and I had to depend on nightly builds to get the most of the application. What made matters worse, Transmission was not allowed on most torrent sites which kept a record of their user ratio. So, I had to revert back to Azureus and suffer the endless wrath of the beachball.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since then. <a href="http://utorrent.com/index.php">uTorrent</a> debuted as a lightweight torrent client for Windows and has been hugely successful. Azureus is now known as Vuze due to its &#8220;legal&#8221; content. And Transmission is finally usable - actually it is more than just that, it turned out to be pretty darn great.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was reading about how good Transmission has become. A lot of Mac users were trying to use Transmission to trump Vuze and the other way around. I decide to investigate this myself and see how transmission compares vs. Vuze.</p>
<p>Finally, a Transmission I can depend on. It has been smooth sailing so far. Compared to Vuze, Transmission is so much quicker to launch, much lighter to run and causes less strain on my Mac. Previously, my MacBook would run a little slower every time a torrent completes and Vuze starts to verify the downloaded data. Transmission doesn&#8217;t even have that feature - a blessing in disguise. Nevertheless, my downloaded data is always perfectly spot on.</p>
<p>Then uTorrent comes along, with its strong Windows pedigree, hoping to penetrate into the Mac torrent world. Has it succeeded? Not quite.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/utorrent-mac-3.png" alt="transmission vs vuze" /></p>
<p>With all the devoted Transmission fans, it is not easy for this New Kid On The Block to instantly change the minds of those who have helped Transmission become what it is today. Based on uTorrent&#8217;s marketing campaign: Lightweight, Feature rich and High Performance; being vague is not going to help it to supersede Transmission. One could also use those exact words to describe Transmission, so what&#8217;s the difference? What is the main defining quality of uTorrent that will make the committed Transmission users to switch over? As far as I can see, there is none.</p>
<p>uTorrent for Mac is currently in beta, which means that it is still under heavy development. It is not as &#8220;Feature rich&#8221; as they make it sound, a quick sift through its preferences reveal nothing spectacular. It is almost identical to Transmission. Have a look at their settings below: Transmission is on the left, uTorrent is on the right.</p>
<h2>Transmission vs uTorrent (Settings Menu)</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/transmission-utorrent-prefs.png" alt="transmission vs utorrent" /></p>
<p>Compared with its Windows brethren, uTorrent for Mac isn&#8217;t even capable of selective file downloading from torrents with multiple files; and doesn&#8217;t include support for RSS feeds. Futhermore, it is <strong>Leopard only</strong>, a big turn off since most of the users who are looking forward to this application would probably be running it on older machines.</p>
<p>So, the answer is<strong> No</strong>. uTorrent is not a viable option for Transmission. At least not yet. But if you still want to give it a chance, you may download it <a href="http://mac.utorrent.com/">here</a>. Let us know what is missing from uTorrent and whether or not <strong>you&#8217;d</strong> switch over from Transmission.</p>
