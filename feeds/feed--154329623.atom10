			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ICE - &#8216;In Case of Emergency&#8217;</p>
<p>We all carry our mobile phones with names &amp; numbers stored in its memory but nobody, other than ourselves, knows which of these numbers belong t o our closest family or friends.</p>
<p>If we were to be involved in an accident or were taken ill, the people attending us would have our mobile phone but wouldn&#8217;t know who to call. Yes, there are hundreds of numbers stored but which one is the contact person in case of an emergency? Hence this &#8216;ICE&#8217; (In Case of Emergency) Campaign</p>
<p>The concept of &#8216;ICE&#8217; is catching on quickly. It is a method of contact during emergency situations. As cell(mobile) phones are carried by the majority of the population, all you need to do is store the number of a contact person or persons who should be contacted during emergency under the name &#8216;ICE&#8217; ( In Case Of Emergency).</p>
<p>The idea was thought up by a paramedic who found that when he went to the scenes of accidents, there were always mobile phones with patients, but they didn&#8217;t know which number to call. He therefore thought that it would be a good idea if there was a nationally recognized name for this purpose. In an emergency situation, Emergency Service personnel and hospital Staff would be able to quickly contact the right person by simply dialing the number you have stored as &#8216;ICE.&#8217;</p>
<p>For more than one contact name simply enter ICE1, ICE2 and ICE3 etc. A great idea that will make a difference!</p>
<p>Let &#8217;s spread the concept of ICE by storing  an ICE number in our  Mobile phones today!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scam : Computer users have to take precautions to protect their hard drives from spam and malware. One of the more common programs to protect computers is Spybot S &amp; D (search and destroy.) If you use it, Scambusters says, beware an e-mail that appears to come from the producers of this software offering an upgrade to &#8221;Spybot 2009&#8221; or &#8221;Spybot Protection 2009.&#8221;</p>
<p>How it works: You receive an e-mail, which may also arrive in your inbox as spam even if you don&#8217;t have the original software, which provides a download link hosted in Panama. Various reports say that the program is either a rip-off of the original or it contains malware, Scambusters says.</p>
<p>What to do: Most programs, including Spybot, automatically check for updates or have an item in their help menu that allows you to do this manually, Scambusters says. If you get an e-mail offering updates for any software, don&#8217;t click the link but go to the producer&#8217;s official home page by keying in the URL, they say.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of scam has been around for a long time and Internet thieves have been coming up with new fake sites for as long as online police have been trying to take them down. You also may find bogus download sites for Ad-Aware, another spyware remover. Be careful.</p>
