<title>Know Your Competition</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/315457529/know_your_competition.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently being pitched by a smart team of guys who are building an interesting business in the digital music space.  The team has great domain expertise and plenty of credibility as entrepreneurs who have built a number of related businesses in the past.  They were doing a nice job of selling the opportunity . . . until they got to the competition slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that often times when I am pitched on a business, the competition slide is treated as, at best, a necessary evil.  It's in there because it is "supposed" to be, but not much more.  Sure, I've seen some really creative ways entrepreneurs have found to place themselves alone in the upper right corner of a 4X4 matrix.  And I've heard -- perhaps more often than is merited by reality -- that there isn't any competition.  But I rarely get a thorough assessment of how others are approaching the opportunity and how the pitching team is meaningfully differentiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should you focus on the competition?  Isn't that just unnecessarily opening yourself up to questions about your business that may not otherwise be raised?  Shouldn't you focus on your own business and its powerful attributes and not on the competition?  Sure, the glories of your own product and strategy should be the centerpiece of your presentation, but the competition slide gives you a unique opportunity to show how smart you really are about the market you are attacking.  Great entrepreneurs eat and breath the space in which they are building their business.  And they don't just internalize their own market strategy, they watch every move the competition makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know a great entrepreneur when you meet one?  Great entrepreneurs would do a better job running the competition than their competitors are doing.  They can tell you not only the ways in which their strategy is better than their competitors', but also the ways in which their competitors have created the very opportunity that they are exploiting.  There is nothing more credibility building during a presentation than doing a great job of answering questions about the competition, and nothing more damning than doing a bad job.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to any entrepreneur -- learn as much as possible about the competition.  Not just because you'll do a better job of pitching your company, but because you'll do a better job of running your company.  And, in the end, that is what ultimately matters the most.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MicroHoo:  The Social Network That Could Have Been</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/288492195/microhoo_the_social_network_that_could_have_been.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the many weeks of on-again, off-again MicroHoo madness, I did a fair bit of pontificating and speculating of my own about the would-be deal.  After all, it was THE Bay Area topic of conversation (for one brief moment we all put our Facebook speculation on hold -- I am so pleased that we can get back to speculating about Facebook now and, better yet, speculating about MicroBook, or is it FaceSoft?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the MicroHoo conversations I had centered around the combined assets of Microsoft and Yahoo.  What could the two companies, in combination, bring to bear upon the Internet landscape?  And while the press largely liked to discuss the impact a Microsoft/Yahoo merger would have on the search market, to my mind that was not the biggest advantage of the combination.  From where I sit, the greatest combined asset of Microsoft and Yahoo would be their vast social graph data.  Farmed properly, MicroHoo could have enabled a stunningly powerful social network using nothing more than the fumes of their existing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the power of Microsoft's and Yahoo's social data, one need look no further than the first visit to virtually every social service.  The first thing you are asked to do in the registration process is to give your login data for Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, etc.  Why?  Because each new social experience on the Web needs to recreate your social graph and the best way to jump start that process is to use the social graph data you already have stored in your existing communications services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if MicroHoo were to simply farm the social data contained in all of its current social services?  Step one, implement a unified login across all MicroHoo services.  I must say that this is one thing that Yahoo has gotten right from the very beginning (and Google has been a fast follower).  Since its inception, Yahoo has viewed the customer experience as a unified one across all of its properties.  And with each of its acquisitions, job number one has been to unify the login experience.  Thus, Yahoo knows that "davidhornik" on Yahoo Mail is the same as "davidhornik" on Flickr is the same as "davidhornik" on MyYahoo.  What if MicroHoo also knew that it was the same as "davidhornik" on Microsoft Messenger and as "davidhornik" on Hotmail?  In fact, MicroHoo could know that I am the same "davidhornik" on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo Messenger&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/"&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/"&gt;Upcoming&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hotmail.com/"&gt;Hotmail&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/overview"&gt;Windows Live Messenger&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xbox.com:80/en-US/live"&gt;Xbox Live&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every one of these services contains data from which MicroHoo could have created a social graph an order of magnitude larger than MySpace or Facebook.  Add on top of that social data compelling personalized experiences drawn from the likes of &lt;a href="http://my.yahoo.com/"&gt;MyYahoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.zune.net/"&gt;Zune.net&lt;/a&gt;, etc. and you've got the makings of a pretty powerful social experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why haven't Yahoo and Microsoft done this on their own, let alone in combination?  That's a great question.  If I were in charge, it is where I would start.  As all experiences on the Web increasingly are informed by social relationships, the long term winners will be the players who can bring the most social data to bear on their services.  What's more, as can be seen in the recent announcements by &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/08/myspace-embraces-data-portability-partners-with-yahoo-ebay-and-twitter/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/09/facebook-responds-to-myspace-with-facebook-connect/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/09/threes-company-google-to-launch-friend-connect-on-monday/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to own that social graph and make it available for use by third-party services will prove invaluable.  While Google has relatively little to offer in terms of existing social data, both Yahoo and Microsoft sit on treasure troves of data (as does AOL for that matter) that would allow them to legitimately compete with MySpace and Facebook as the Social Graph of Record for the rest of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that it would be easy for Microsoft or Yahoo to create a social network from whole cloth.  I know it wouldn't.  (Just look at Yahoo 360.)  But the prize is well worth the effort.  Consider the millions of people who have yet to join any social network.  While Yahoo and Microsoft may not be the likely starting point for Millennials, it strikes me as a very natural place for the rest of the Web to discover and embrace social networking.  Similarly,  Microsoft and/or Yahoo seem the natural repositories of the social graph of record for the rest of the Web.  If MicroHoo is ever reborn, the big opportunity for the combined companies is to create the social network for everyone else (and the social graph for everything else).  In the mean time, Jerry and Steve, if you are listening, you probably should get working on it independently.  My guess is that your future in the Web depends upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Welcoming Howard Hartenbaum to August Capital</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/269859361/welcoming_howard_hartenbaum_to_august_capital.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started talking to my now-partners about joining August Capital, I was stunned at the slow pace of the conversation.  I couldn't imagine how it could take months to make a decision about whether or not to invite me to join the partnership.  Admittedly, I wasn't coming from the most conventional background to enter the venture industry.  But over the course of months, the August partners had more than enough time to talk with pretty much everyone I'd ever met in my professional life (plus a few choice grade school teachers while they were at it).  In the end, after four months of grilling, I was invited to join August Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I remember thinking to myself "how could it possibly take four months to decide?"  It seemed like an absurdly long process.  Yet, having now been in the venture business for some time, and having been on the other side of that process, it is amazing to me that it didn't take longer.  Why is that?  Two things in particular strike me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that partnerships are small, delicate creatures.  At August, there were only four partners when I joined.  That's not very many people.  And partners spend a lot of time together.  We make collective decisions about nearly all things in the partnership -- from investment decisions, to personnel decisions, to culinary decisions.  And we each serve as a reality check for the rest of our partners.  So keeping a partnership functional, let alone collegial, is tricky business.  Rest assured, adding a new partner can throw off that balance really easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is that adding a partner is a much bigger economic decision than making an investment in a company.  I don't mean it is an economic decision in the sense of sharing the economics of the partnership.  But rather, it is an economic decision because each new partner will be responsible for making a set of investments out of the partnership.  If you make the right decision, your new partner will make investment choices that accrete large returns back to the partnership.  But if you make the wrong decision, your new partner could easily invest tens of millions of dollars in companies that ultimately fail, hamstringing the overall fund returns.  So adding a partner is a bit like making an indirect bet on a bunch of companies -- getting it wrong will have a widespread impact on your fund performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all that, the decks are stacked against anyone joining a venture capital partnership.  It is just too easy to find reasons to say "no."  Which is why it absolutely thrills me to welcome Howard Hartenbaum to the August Capital partnership.  Howard has successfully run the gauntlet and come out the other side, and we are already enjoying the benefits of Howard's perspective and approach.  Howard is simply a fantastic guy, and we are lucky to have him join us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don't know Howard, here are a few quick thoughts on why he's such a great fit for us at August.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Howard is a geek.  After graduating from MIT, Howard didn't join an investment bank; he joined Honda Motor Company where he served as an ergonomics engineer.  He got to build awesome products like the NSX.  If there is one thing we like to do at partners meetings while eating lunch, it is talk about cars.  Cars and email.  Cars, email and digital photography.  Cars, email, digital photography and high speed wireless.  Cars, email, digital photography, high speed wireless and smart phones.  Cars, email, digital photography . . . you get the point.  Howard is a welcomed addition to the conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Howard firmly believes that the most important thing in a start-up are the founders.  Howard has a great track record of working with entrepreneurs to help them bring their vision to fruition.  As a result, entrepreneurs love Howard because he is helpful without being overbearing.  What's more, Howard was an entrepreneur before becoming an investor.  So he's been on both sides of the table and can bring that perspective not only to his portfolio companies, but also to our investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And third, Howard is a great investor.  Prior to joining us at August Capital, Howard was a General Partner with &lt;a href="http://www.draperrichards.com/"&gt;Draper Richards&lt;/a&gt;.  He has invested in dozens of interesting technology companies.  Notably, Howard was the very first investor in Skype and got involved in the business on the company building side (Howard was active in Skype's global business development efforts and served as the GM of Skype's US business).  Howard was also an investor in Photobucket and Bebo, among many others.  Howard's track record is impressive and it hasn't gone unnoticed -- he was named to the Forbes &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/99/biz_07midas_Howard-Hartenbaum_4DR8.html"&gt;Midas List&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all that, it only took us a few months to invite Howard to join us at August.  After all, we had to find time to talk with Howard's EE professors and his chess team coach :)  We consider ourselves very lucky to have Howard as part of August Capital.  He is a fantastic investor, a geek at heart, and a great guy to hang out with.  What more could one ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No Adjectives Please!</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/246011851/no_adjectives_allowed.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having breakfast this morning with &lt;a href="http://www.baypartners.com/team/s_deshpande.htm"&gt;Salil Deshpande&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://baypartners.com/"&gt;Bay Partners&lt;/a&gt;.  Salil and I were talking about assessing company progress and how best to measure that progress.  Salil invests in super early-stage deals and has his companies report to him on their progress on a frequent basis.  He said that he had one CEO who would report on his progress in such florid language that eventually Salil had to forbid his use of adjectives in his progress reports.  Salil said that he didn't want to hear that things were going great.  He wanted to hear precisely how things were going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly jumped out of my seat.  Salil had articulated one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to company pitches (and board meetings for that matter).  I hate adjectives.  I don't want to hear that one of the company founders is a "fantastic sales exec."  I want to hear that she was Presidents Club the last twelve years running.  I don't want to hear that the product is "revolutionary and paradigm-shifting."  I want to hear about the specific features of the product that are differentiated and how.  I don't want to hear that the company has "massive market traction."  I want to see a graph of progressive quarterly sales and a giant sales pipeline.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjectives are not convincing.  Facts are convincing.  I may not agree with the conclusions a company draws from those facts.  But I will at least be in a position to appropriately assess those conclusions.  Whereas adjectives are all about conclusions without the underlying facts.  As an entrepreneur, you are far better off having me determine that your market is "massive," your founders are "brilliant," and your product is "elegant," than to tell me that your company has "an elegant solution serving a massive market designed by brilliant founders."  So reread your pitch and remove all of the adjectives.  It will go massively, monumentally, gargantuanly. colossally better that way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Five Years of VentureBlog</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/239554492/a_little_over_five_years.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A little over five years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/management"&gt;Andrew Anker&lt;/a&gt; and I started chatting about blogging.  There was plenty of blogging going on already for sure.  But no one in the Sand Hill crowd was thinking about it.  At the time there was still a prevailing sense that venture investing was a black box and any view into the box was a bad idea.  Andrew and I talked about the fact that we didn't buy that.  We thought there were all sorts of things VCs could talk about that would be interesting and valuable to entrepreneurs.  Andrew proposed we start VentureBlog and came up with the tagline "A Random Walk Down Sand Hill Road" -- we laughed and VentureBlog was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago (technically, five years ago tomorrow), Andrew posted our "&lt;a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/2003/02/welcome_to_vent.php"&gt;Hello, World&lt;/a&gt;."  Andrew wrote that we would chat about what we do as early stage venture investors and concluded, "Mostly, we'll figure it out as we go along. No idea if this is a sustainable idea or not, but we're going to give it a go. Enjoy!"  Since that first post there have been a few different folks come and go on VentureBlog, but, for better or worse, I have stuck around and kept on writing.  I have tried my best to give a view into the black box and bring a little humor to it in the process.  It has been a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing has changed for sure since we started VentureBlog.  There are now dozens of VC bloggers.  From Sand Hill Road (&lt;a href="http://lsvp.wordpress.com/"&gt;Jeremy Liew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://reality.org/"&gt;Susan Wu&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to New York City (&lt;a href="http://avc.blogs.com/"&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.beyondvc.com/"&gt;Ed Sim&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to Colorado (&lt;a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/"&gt;Brad Feld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ryanmcintyre.com/blog/"&gt;Ryan McIntyre&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to Boston (&lt;a href="http://vcmike.wordpress.com/"&gt;Mike Hirshland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bostonvcblog.typepad.com/vc/"&gt;Jeff Bussgang&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to Philadelphia (&lt;a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/"&gt;Josh Kopelman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nothingtosay.firstround.com/"&gt;Chris Fralic&lt;/a&gt;, etc.?).  The problem entrepreneurs have is no longer finding information, it is sorting through it.  So much has been written and so much more will be written about startups and entrepreneurship and Venture Capital.  And I learn a pile from all of you every day.  So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the question of whether or not VentureBlog is a sustainable idea, I guess the answer is "yes" and "no."  I have been writing with varying degrees of frequency over these past five years.  It is great to have a venue to share my thoughts when something jumps out at me.  And I hope to continue writing for the foreseeable future.  On the other hand, in the face of superhuman VC bloggers like &lt;a href="http://avc.blogs.com/"&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/"&gt;Brad Feld&lt;/a&gt;, I feel deeply inadequate.  How they manage to write day in and day out while finding time to do anything else is truly beyond me.  My hat's off to them.  And my apologies to those of you who feel that VentureBlog is too infrequently written to be relevant.  I will try harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greatly appreciate the conversations we've had here at VentureBlog.  And I am thrilled to see the massive ecosystem of VC bloggers that has emerged.  Many thanks to those of you who continue to read, link and comment.  It has been a monumental education and a great privilege.  And a huge thanks to Andrew for getting this whole thing started.  Here's to the next five years.  &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Obsession is the Fuel of Silicon Valley</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/236109897/obsession_is_the_fuel_of_silicon_valley.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting debate has broken out between Glenn Kelman and Mike Arrington.  Glenn is the CEO of Redfin, a Seattle-based startup that is trying to modernize the process of buying and selling homes.  Glenn's a smart guy and a great entrepreneur.  And he has always struck me as quite thoughtful.  Which is why I was surprised to read his recent blog post entitled, "&lt;a href="http://blog.redfin.com/blog/2008/02/the_next_silicon_valley.html"&gt;How Green Was My Valley.&lt;/a&gt;"  In that post, Glenn extolls the virtues of Seattle, while attacking Silicon Valley:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the Valley's monomania is really just a kind of pubescence. What else could account for the Valley's self-righteousness, its congregations of frustrated dudes, its all-nighters, idealism, delusions of grandeur, mood-swings, longings, dramas, hero-worship and pranks? Anywhere else by contrast seems all grown-up."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.  Those are strong words.  And the rest of his post is equally provocative.  Glenn doesn't just praise Seattle.  He berates the Bay Area.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first read Glenn's post, I almost took the bait.  But I thought better of it.  Mike Arrington, on the other hand, &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/15/an-outsiders-flawed-view-of-silicon-valley/"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt;.  Mike couldn't have Glenn badmouth the Bay Area as a "heartless amnesiac" without pointing out to Glenn that the Bay Area knows better than to waste its time focusing on the past.  Mike couldn't let Glenn get away with praising the Seattle lifestyle without pointing out that it is just that, a lifestyle; the Bay Area has better things to do than worry about lifestyle.  Mike couldn't let Glenn get away with baldly suggesting that Bay Area businesses are trendy and Seattle businesses focus on "what works" without giving a single concrete example; the Bay Area is all about specific examples, not baseless accusations.  Mike couldn't let Glenn get away with any of it.  That's just not something Mike can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't raise this to join in the rumble against Glenn.  I am a fan of Seattle.  My partners at August Capital have funded some great companies in Seattle, not the least of which is Microsoft.  But I do want to take issue with one of Glenn's criticisms of the Bay Area.  Glenn refers in a number of different ways to the obsessiveness of the Bay Area and suggests that the Bay Area's "monomania" is somehow a detriment to company building.  I have to disagree.  I love the obsessiveness of the Bay Area.  It is the drug that fuels the Bay Area's startup economy.  And it is the drug that fuels my every day as a tech investor.  I love the fact that I can talk about entrepreneurship at AYSO.  I love the fact that I can have conference calls with my CEO's at 1am.  I love the fact that wildly successful entrepreneurs who could retire for life dive into their next venture within six months of leaving their last.  I love the fact that Palo Alto's newest &lt;a href="http://www.fraicheyogurt.com/"&gt;yogurt shop&lt;/a&gt; is a hotbed of tech recruiting.  I love the fact that I funded a company after bumping into them at a local coffee shop.  I love the fact that school auctions include items like "a tour of Facebook" and "10 hours with a trademark attorney" and "company logo design."  Is it obsessive?  You bet.  Is it good for business?  You bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, I don't actually think that the obsessiveness of successful startups in the Bay Area is any different from that of successful startups in Seattle.  I happen to know that Glenn himself is completely obsessed with entrepreneurship and building Redfin into the next great company.  What is unique about the Bay Area is the pervasiveness of that obsession.  It is everywhere you go.  And I don't think that's a bug.  I think it's a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Startups Have Bigger Things to Worry About Than MicroHoo!</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/231127362/startups_have_bigger_things_to_worry_about_than_microhoo.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am definitely late to the party in praising Marc Andreessen's incredibly great &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;.  That said, my failure to extoll the virtues of Marc and his dead-on insights is not the result of me personally arriving late at the lovefest.  I have been thrilled to read Marc's uniformly interesting and well-reasoned insights since blog post #1.  I just haven't had the right opportunity to suck up to Marc and tell him how much I care.  Thankfully, that moment has come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are as big a &lt;a href="http://www.techmeme.com/"&gt;Techmeme&lt;/a&gt; addict as am I, you have probably noticed this little discussion going on in the blog world about the would-be Microsoft/Yahoo merger.  I have never seen a single issue take over Techmeme so completely.  And the discussion about MicroHoo! or YahooSoft! has been pretty overwhelmingly damning of Microsoft and its proposal in general.  A friend of mine recently referred to Microsoft as the Big Bad Wolf, which I think pretty much sums up what tech commentators have to say about the deal.  But out of the increasingly loud chants of "Burn the Witch" came a voice of dissent (reason?) -- Marc Andreessen self-titled "&lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/02/silicon-valley.html"&gt;contrarian view&lt;/a&gt;" (the full title is "Silicon Valley after a Microsoft/Yahoo merger: a contrarian view") poses, well, a contrarian view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In six broad points, Marc argues that with or without the MicroHoo! deal, nothing has changed in Silicon Valley.  There are lots of startups out there.  There are lots of acquirers out there.  But, more importantly, there are millions of steps between the two and a preoccupation with the contraction or expansion of the potential pool of acquirers distracts from the real job at hand, which is building meaningful companies.  I am tempted to quote Marc in his entirety on this point (you should definitely go &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/02/silicon-valley.html"&gt;read it all&lt;/a&gt;) but I think this chunk sums it up well -- Marc writes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Building your startup with a goal of getting acquired is foolishness anyway, in my opinion. Smart people disagree with me on this, but I'll make my case in two points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;* Big companies don't want to buy startups that want to get bought. Instead, big companies buy startups that have built something of value that they decide is important to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * You can't possibly guess what things of value big companies are going to want to own in one or two or three years. The world is changing too fast -- witness the Microsoft hostile bid for Yahoo itself! -- and besides, big companies are Moby Dick and you can't understand the reasoning behind their decisions anyway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine those two points with the fact that no big company buys that many startups each year anyway, and it's easy to see that the odds of you successfully anticipating something that a big company is going to want in the future and then actually selling your company to them -- as your strategy -- is a very risky proposition that is highly prone to failure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely!  Not only is this the right answer to concerns about a Microsoft/Yahoo! merger, this has also been my answer to concerns about a recession.  Startups have too many things to worry about along the path to creating a meaningful business for these macro trends to be more than a distraction.  They may have an impact on timing -- when you may or may not get bought or go public -- but they rarely if ever have an impact on your ultimate success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc's "contrarian" view concludes, "Your job is exactly the same as before: build something people want, scale it up, make sure it's defensible, and make sure you can make money with it.  Build a company you are proud of."  Right on, Marc.  That's a great summary of how I view my job every day.  That should be my VC credo: to find, fund and build companies to be proud of!  And nothing about MicroHoo! or the subprime debt crisis is going to change how I go about that.  So carry on Silicon Valley.  We've got a lot of hard work to do building great companies.  Everything else is just a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Entrepreneurial Success According to Paul Graham and Madeline Albright</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/225790533/entrepreneurial_success_according_to_paul_graham_and_madelin.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Driving home from the city yesterday I was listening to a very interesting interview of Madeline Albright on &lt;a href="http://www.kqed.org/programs/radio/archive.jsp?progID=RD58"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.  Albright made a range of insightful observations about diplomacy, world affairs and the Presidency.  During the course of the interview, one statement in particular jumped out at me.  Albright said that she would rather have a President who was confident than a President who was certain.  She noted that a confident President could take principled positions and stand for things that mattered, but would still have the good sense to listen to those around him and take counsel from a range of brilliant advisors.  In contrast, a certain President would have no need for advisors because the appropriate course would be "clear" to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madeline Albright's comments reminded me of a &lt;a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/2006/09/paul_graham_is.php"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; I heard &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/"&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; give at &lt;a href="http://ventureblog.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=foo+camp"&gt;Foo Camp&lt;/a&gt; a couple summers ago.  Paul was discussing the attributes of successful enterpreneurs, and he argued that the best entrepreneurs were open minded and had good judgment.  He contrasted that with failed entrepreneurs who were stubborn and had bad judgment.  Paul stated that while having bad judgment could be a handicap for an entrepreneur, if you had both bad judgment and were stubborn, you would necessarily fail.  I suppose in Graham's parlance, the President that Madeline Albright is looking for would be confident but open minded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in complete agreement with Madeline Albright and Paul Graham.  Startup success requires confidence but not certainty.  I have worked with startup CEOs in the past who spent more time at board meetings defending their positions than listening to the board's feedback.  Sure, some of the time those CEOs were right and some of the time the Board was wrong.  But board meetings shouldn't be about certainty.  The should be about confidence.  The confidence to hear what other smart people have to say.  The confidence to listen.  The confidence to stand firm on things you believe are critical to the success of your company.  And the confidence to change your position when clearer minds prevail.  Like great Presidents, the best CEOs will have the character and the confidence to lead while listening.  It isn't easy.  But it can mean the difference between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pitching a VC -- The Basics Revisited</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/220519200/pitching_a_vc_the_basics_revisited.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started writing VentureBlog, I used to &lt;a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/presenting-your-company/"&gt;talk a lot about entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time, not a lot had been written about pitching VCs or the Venture Capital process, so there was lots of virgin territory.  Since that time, dozens of VCs have started blogging and much has been said about what it takes to get a VC down the isle.  Bits and pieces here and there -- a good Google archeologist can pull it all together.  But having spent the week pontificating about PowerPoint and the likes, I've decided to take one more swing through the basics of pitching a VC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I thought about the process of pitching a business, it struck me that no matter what the stage, the information was essentially the same.  A good elevator pitch contains the same content as a good executive summary contains the same content as a good PowerPoint contains the same content as a good business plan.  The distinction among these business descriptions is not the substance, it is the degree to which the essential elements are fleshed out.  Each document contains slightly more detail than the preceding.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevator Pitch --&gt; Executive Summary --&gt; PowerPoint --&gt; Business Plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes good intuitive sense.  There is no reason that the things that are most compelling about your business would change based upon the nature of the business description.  Nor would an investor be interested in different things by virtue of the form that description takes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, then, are the essential elements that make up a good PowerPoint, a persuasive elevator pitch, a compelling executive summary?  I have no doubt that VCs will differ somewhat on the precise list, as well as the order and the emphasis.  But at its core, I believe that a successful business description should include the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
2. Team&lt;br /&gt;
3. Product&lt;br /&gt;
4. Market&lt;br /&gt;
5. Business Model&lt;br /&gt;
6. Competition&lt;br /&gt;
7. Financials&lt;br /&gt;
8. Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are pitching a VC, start with these 8 slides.  If you are writing an executive summary, start with these 8 headings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously some businesses will require additional information that is outside the scope of these basics.  I am not suggesting for a second that you should always pigeonhole your business into these categories alone.  But they are a great starting point from which to build a persuasive description of your business.  &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Entrepreneurship for Lawyers</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/215352399/entrepreneurship_for_lawyers.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently reading some old posts on Venture Blog and couldn't believe how short they were.  One might call them pithy.  Or one might also call them lazy.  Either way, they were short.  I should really try that again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been teaching a class at Harvard Law School this winter semester called &lt;a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/courses/2007-08/?id=4019"&gt;Venture Capital and the Technology Start-up&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jpalfrey.html"&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt;, the Executive Director of the &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/"&gt;Berkman Center&lt;/a&gt;.  It is really fun to be back at the law school and working with John.  I have been blown away by the energy that the law students are bringing to the topic of Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital.  Sadly, I never had a VC or Entrepreneurship class in law school.  Lets see, I had torts, contracts, criminal law, federal courts, administrative law, property, intellectual property, corporations, securities regulation, constitutional law . . . but no entrepreneurship.  Then again, I don't know that I would have had the sense to actually take a VC or Entrepreneurship class back then.  So its presence would have been wasted on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my students had to actually pitch business ideas to real live VCs from the Boston area.  And they did a great job.  As I was discussing with them how to think about company building and pitching, it struck me that much like the law, building great companies is all about applying precedent.  Only, instead of the applicable precedent being case law in this instance, the applicable precedent is a business case.  Pitching your business is all about finding the right business analogs and describing how they apply to the company you're building (e.g., "we're the Amazon.com of funeral supplies.").  That isn't so different from finding the right case analogs and describing how they apply to the lawsuit you're defending.  So there may be hope that we lawyers are able to figure out this entrepreneurship stuff yet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Venture Capital in China</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/211542257/venture_capital_in_china.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last several years there has been a lot of talk on Sand Hill Road about investing in China.  To a certain degree there has been a lot of talk about all the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China.  But the most excitement is clearly around China.  (Interestingly, while India is a relatively close second, I have yet to hear of a single Bay Area VC exploring investment in either Brazil or Russia).  Drawn by huge markets and a rapidly expanding economy, American VC's are heading to China to stake their claims.  Go East young VC's.  Go East.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture Capital investment in China has not, however, been a headlong dive.  Bay Area VC's seem to be sending over exploratory parties.  By way of example, David Chao from Doll Capital has been in and out of China for some time.  Now a number of his partners are getting in on the act as well.  Paul Koontz from Foundation Capital spent a year in China exploring the market.  And perhaps the best indicator that the Chinese market is hot is Dick Kramlich's pilgrimage to China this year.  Kramlich is one of the founding fathers of Sand Hill Road -- a 25 year veteran of the venture capital business.  Not one to miss out on a big opportunity, Kramlich has headed over to China for 2008 to catch the wave of entrepreneurship and, perhaps, some of the Beijing olympics.  Chow, Koontz and Kramlich are not the only US VC's headed to China by any stretch of the imagination.  But these high profile forays into the Chinese market are excellent indicators of the level of interest in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard not to be intrigued by the Chinese market.  With 1.3 Billion people, you don't need a huge amount of penetration to hit big numbers.  One percent of the Chinese market is 13 million people.  As they say, if you are "one in a million" in China, there are thirteen-hundred people just like you.  What's more, the Chinese government anticipates that approximately 300 Million people will move from the countryside to urban centers in the next decade -- that's the same number as the entire population of the United States.  The combination of massive aggregate numbers, rapid urban migration (and the commensurate increase in wages) and relatively low concentrations of modernized business processes, suggest a market ripe for investment.  And that is precisely the conclusion many of my brethren on Sand Hill Road have drawn.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I was anxious to check out China for myself.  And right before the new year, I had the good fortune to do just that -- I accompanied a group of Stanford Business School students on a ten day study trip to China.  We met with senior executives from companies like China Telecom, Alibaba, GM China and Bao Steel, as well as senior government officials and party leaders (yes, it is still a Communist country).  But the most interesting discussions, to my mind, were with the leading private investors in China.  (Because my meetings with these private investors took place as part of a study trip, there was no expectation that I would blog about the content of our conversations -- thus, I have decided to exclude the names of the specific investors so as not to violate any confidences they may have reasonable expected.)  These investors gave a surprisingly candid view of venture capital throughout the country -- the good, the bad and the ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the mind of the Chinese investing community, the market dynamics described above well outweigh the risks of investing in the current environment.  Huge markets with lots of business white space provides for numerous opportunities for economic gain.  While American investors are busy debating the degree to which the US startup market is saturated, Chinese investors are having trouble keeping up with the inflow of opportunities.  The opportunities in China seem unbounded, making foreign investors starry-eyed.  But despite the glories of the Chinese market -- and there is no denying that the demographic trends in China are glorious -- I heard more than enough from Chinese investors to scare me away from the market.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an initial matter, the biggest challenge that investors find in building Chinese startups is identifying great entrepreneurs.  Because there has been all but no startup culture prior to a handful of years ago, there are essentially no seasoned entrepreneurs.  A few native Chinese business expats are returning from abroad to take advantage of China's increasingly open economy.  But those numbers are de minimis and do nothing to staff the rest of the enterprise.  Meanwhile, Chinese executives have been trained to function in a business culture of bureaucracy and Party connections -- not the fast-paced, fluid environment of the startup world.  The investors with whom I met lamented the lack of qualified executives and warned about the significant challenges of doing diligence on Chinese entrepreneurs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge with entrepreneurship in China is grounded in the laws of China.  The legal structures needed to support a vibrant startup economy are, at best, embryonic.  Neither entrepreneurs nor investors are particularly well protected by the Chinese legal system.  One investor with who I met on my trip described a recent situation in which he funded an entrepreneur, only to have that entrepreneur turn around and leave for business school months later.  The entrepreneur assured the investor that he would be better situated to make the business a success after the two years of school.  The investor had no recourse as his money left the country with the entrepreneur.  In another instance, an investor backed an entrepreneur in a business that thereafter appeared to be failing.  However, a couple years later when the same company started thriving, the entrepreneur informed the investor that it was not the company he had backed.  The investor was incredulous.  He told the entrepreneur that it was the very same company with the same team and even the same name.  The entrepreneur assured the investor that it was, in fact, a different company and that he had not invested in this successful company, his investment was in the previous failed venture.  Despite the obvious deception, the investor told me that he again had no legal recourse.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, venture capital in China is like the wild west.  There are big opportunities, but they are not well defined and capturing their full value may well require manipulating the law to your own devices.  One investor with whom I met described entrepreneurship in the United States like a zoo and entrepreneurship in China like a jungle.  In the United States, he said, while there is always a lion next to you with sharp claws, driven by self-interest, there is a cage between you and the lion to keep you safe.  You can count on the cage to protect you from unreasonable or illegal behavior.  In China, on the other hand, there is no cage between you and the Lion -- if you don't take great pains to protect yourself from the self-interested behavior of the lion, you are going to get bitten.  Case in point, one Chinese executive with whom I met on my trip described how he was able to leverage his dominant market position to force his competitors to sell at a discount.  What's more, the entrepreneur described with pride that once he had bought up all of his competition, he was able to raise his prices three-fold.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another significant challenge for United States VC's seeking to invest in China is the government itself.  While China appears to be making huge market-driven strides in its economy, there remains a significant wild-card in all business transactions -- the Communist government.  On my trip it was repeatedly pointed out to us that government officials don't make laws, Party leaders do.  The government officials are tasked with managing the bureaucracies of their localities, but the party leaders are tasked with making the decisions.  The Communist Party single-handedly makes all of the rules in China.  For example, by mandate of the Party, no Chinese financial institution may be majority-owned by foreign investors.  Thus, the fasted growing segment of the Chinese market is off-limits to foreign investment.  What is to stop the Chinese government from making similar mandates in other market segments?  This lack of predictability of the fundament legal underpinnings of business in China is sufficient in and of itself to make me take pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to China.  The shear scale of Beijing and Shanghai was absolutely stunning, as was the velocity of the growth in both cities.  And the extraordinarily candid conversations we had with Chinese business leaders and Party officials was both surprising and invaluable.  But rather than leaving China emboldened to invest in their great economy, I returned to the United States surprised that my fellow VC's could accept the risks inherent in investing in China.  I could not. And I don't anticipate that changing any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Lobby Conference</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/176927996/the_lobby_conference.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent this week in Hawaii at a conference I hosted called The Lobby.  The idea behind The Lobby was to gather together a fantastic group of people with a shared interest in the future of media and facilitate a conversation among the participants.  There were no speakers on stages, no panels addressing broad themes, no big name mucky-mucks invited to draw crowds, just a fantastically engaged and engaging group of subject-matter experts eager to connect and talk.  Everyone who attended would have been those speakers, those panelists, those mucky-mucks at other conferences, but this conference wasn't about being the center of attention -- it was about participating.  And man did everyone participate.  From dawn to well-past dusk, the folks at The Lobby devoured the conversations.  The energy was frenetic, a veritable Type A Power Plant.  By the time I got on a plane to head home this morning I was literally spent.  I suspect it will be weeks before I'm fully recharged.  And I will take the next 12 months to follow up on everything I've learned, connect with everyone I've met, and prepare for next year's Lobby conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lobby would never have happened had it not been for the encouragement, expertise and friendship of the incredible Lia Lorenzano-Kennett.  Lia is the high priestess of conference production.  She was one of the first Producers of the Apple Developers Conference, ran Demo and Agenda, was the President of IDG Executive Forums, and worked with Walt and Kara to create the phenomenal All This Digital conference, of which she still is the Producer.  When I first met with Lia to talk about my idea for The Lobby, she told me that she had always wondered what made a great conference -- was it the speakers or the audience?  And she had always wondered what was the answer to the age old conference chicken and egg problem.  Was a conference made great by the people who attended?  Or did great people only attend great conferences?  As The Lobby wound to a close this week, Lia turned to me and said "so now we know -- it's the chicken."  And man were there some great chickens in attendance at The Lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to tell you more about The Lobby, but that's about all that I can say without breaching my own terms of the conference.  The Lobby was from the very outset touted as an off the record conversation about the future of media.  When attendees registered for the conference, they confirmed that they would not report on anything said by the other attendees.  My theory was that if everyone felt comfortable that their discussions and conversations would not be reported beyond the confines of the event, people would speak more freely and we would all get a lot more out of it.  I still believe that is true, although I am not certain how realistic it is to assume that in this day and age there is such a thing as off the record.  It is too easy for information to be disseminated, either with attribution or anonymously.  And what constitutes "off the record"?  Is it still off the record if you report what was said at the event but don't attribute it to anyone in particular?  Is it still off the record when you Twitter "having great conversations at The Lobby" or "Will sell bead clue for $100"?  Is it still off the record when you post a public photo of the event to Flickr or Photobucket?  What if that photo paints another attendee in a less than flattering light?  Is it off the record if you simply report that you are attending The Lobby, even if you never mention more than the meals you had at the event?  For what it is worth, my goal was to keep the content of the conversations off the record (attributed or otherwise, during sessions or at the bar, to a few or to thousands).  My slogan for The Lobby was "the content is the conversation" -- off the record was about promoting open discussion, not creating a secret society.  But it is a tough line to draw and I will continue to ponder these questions in anticipation of The Lobby 2.  Until that time, I look forward to continuing to participate in the rapid evolution of digital media and hope that The Lobby has played some small role in that evolution.  &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sick Blogging:  Graphing Social Patterns and DonorsChoose Blogger Challenge</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/165567291/sick_blogging_graphing_social_patterns_and_donorschoose_blog.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the good things about being home sick is that you have time to blog.  So let me catch up on a couple of quick things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Graphing Social Patterns Conference&lt;/u&gt;:  The first one is that my friend Dave McClure has organized an interesting conference that is coming up called "&lt;a href="http://graphingsocial.com"&gt;Graphing Social Patterns:  The Business and Technology of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;"  The event is all about Facebook as a platform for other businesses and will have some great speakers like Tim O'Reilly and Reid Hoffman.  The Facebook phenomenon is sweeping Silicon Valley and this is the first event to try to put it in some perspective.  The conference is in San Jose from October 7th through 9th and you can &lt;a href="http://graphingsocial.eventbrite.com/?discount=vblog"&gt;REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt; to get a 25% discount on the conference (because VentureBlog isn't just about information, it is also all about value).  Also, don't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.videoegg.com"&gt;VideoEgg&lt;/a&gt; conference called &lt;a href="http://www.app-camp.com/"&gt;App Camp&lt;/a&gt; on how to build a real business on Facebook.  VideoEgg have become The experts on rich media advertising and monetization of social media.  Given that, App Camp will be a very interesting discussion of how to actually make money on Facebook.  I have been saying for a long time that I believed social networking (or, the "social graph" in today's parlance) would become a core piece of infrastructure in all sorts of applications and the Facebook platform is the perfect extension of that observation -- now application providers can outsource the entire social networking infrastructure to Facebook and focus on the overlying application.  It will be interesting to see how these applications and monetization continue to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;DonorsChoose Blogger Challenge&lt;/u&gt;:  The second random snippet of this fine sick day is Kara Swisher's quest for lunch with Jerry Yang.  &lt;a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20071004/blogger-charity-smackdown/"&gt;According to Kara&lt;/a&gt;, the Yahoo PR machine won't give her direct access to Jerry, so she is working on an end run to the problem.  In support of the DonorsChoose &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html"&gt;blogger challenge&lt;/a&gt;, Yahoo has offered a &lt;a href="http://yodel.yahoo.com/2007/09/28/you-know-for-the-kids/"&gt;lunch with Jerry&lt;/a&gt; for the blogger who gets the most donors to give money to schools through DonorChoose.org.  Kara is hoping to earn that honor so that she can dine with Jerry and, no doubt, put it on video tape.  The DonorsChoose blogger challenge is a fantastic way to help out worthy school projects.  But since I'm late to the challenge, I may as well lend my support to Kara, who has chosen some great projects to fund.  So if you are interested in contributing to some worthy causes, click &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=17217"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to get to Kara's DonorChoose page.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you all are healthy.  I strongly recommend getting flu shots.  Trust me.  Get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Ramblings of an Itinerant VentureBlogger</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/159346813/hello_ventureblog_readers_are_there.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello VentureBlog readers.  Are there still any of you out there?  My hat is off to folks like &lt;a href="http://avc.blogs.com/"&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who blog religiously on a daily basis.  While I post a thing or two daily to my personal &lt;a href="http://davidhornik.vox.com"&gt;Vox blog&lt;/a&gt;, that's usually a picture, a quote, a video.  Fully formed sentences are a bonus on my Vox blog.  But what it lacks in structure and depth, it makes up in cute pictures and video of my kids.  Sure, my mom is willing to read VentureBlog and pretend she gives a crap about liquidation preference because I'm her son, but when it comes to cute pictures of her grandchildren, she'll check that blog with OCD consistency.  My mom's desire for more info on her grandchildren, however, is no excuse for neglecting VentureBlog.  And so I return to the hallowed pages of VentureBlog (I hope it is more hallowed than hollow).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever read a newspaper column and get annoyed when it is just a bunch of little snippets without any overriding theme or structure.  Lazy, lazy, lazy.  Well, for the sake of easing back into VentureBlog, this post is going to smack of those lazy columns.  Sorry about that.  I'll try to do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, welcome to the New and Improved VentureBlog.  Do not be confused by its near identical appearance to the old and not yet improved VentureBlog (particularly if you are reading this via my RSS feed :)).  VentureBlog is now running on &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.com/"&gt;MT4&lt;/a&gt;.  There's been a ton said out there about MT4 -- lots and lots of praise for its depth, simplicity and beautiful new UI.  I second all of that (and not just because I'm an investor).  It is a pleasure to use and the MT team deserves a pile of credit for continuing to raise the bar for blogging software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprising to most of you, I'm sure, I spent the beginning part of this week at the &lt;a href="http://techcrunch20.com/2007/index.php"&gt;TechCrunch40&lt;/a&gt; conference.  While folks like &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/d"&gt;Walt Mossberg, Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/"&gt;Chris Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.web2summit.com/"&gt;John Battelle&lt;/a&gt;, make it look easy, the conference business is anything but.  It takes a pile of planning, a huge amount of leg work, some real personality and a fair bit of luck to make a new conference work.  But Mike, Jason and Heather pulled it off in a big way.  The TechCrunch40 had the necessary mix of startup energy, investors trolling the halls, journalists chasing down stories, and ice cream bars.  So congratulations to them for a great conference.  If you couldn't make it to the TechCrunch40 and want to get a feel for the energy in the halls, Craig and I recorded a &lt;a href="http://www.gruntmedia.com/venturecast.html"&gt;VentureCast&lt;/a&gt; show there that I am sure Craig will be posting shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was at the TC40 event, I bumped into Michael Copeland.  Michael is a great guy and an equally great journalist.  It saddened me to see "Fortune" on his name tag.  I don't have any problem with Fortune.  I like the magazine and I'm thrilled that Michael is writing for them now.  But it was just a reminder of the terrible decision by Time Inc. to shut down Business 2.0.  The crew at Business 2.0 worked hard to understand and articulate the underlying trends that continue to power this round of Internet innovation.  They weren't content to simply write about the fads after they had been outed by the blogosphere.  They dug in.  I was lucky enough to attend a couple of the Business 2.0 gatherings of their "Next Net" companies.  They were lively debates orchestrated by Erick Schonfeld and the rest of the Business 2.0 editorial team.  It is a shame that there won't be any more of those gatherings.  Maybe Michael can carry the tradition over to Fortune.  [I wrote this post on a plane this morning and then &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/20/welcome-erick-schonfeld-my-new-co-editor/"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; this evening that Erick Schonfeld has joined TechCrunch as Co-Editor with Arrington.  That is fantastic news for TechCrunch -- Congratulations to Erick, Mike and Heather.] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is par for the course, I didn't actually spend much time in the conference hall during the TechCrunch40.  But during one interesting session in which Marc Andreessen and Dave Filo were explaining to Chad Hurley how they invented the Internet, I peaked in and saw Eric Savitz in the front row blogging away madly.  Have I ever mentioned on VentureBlog how incredibly great Eric Savitz is?  He really is.  Unfortunately, because he writes for Barrons he blogs mostly about the public markets.  Somehow he managed to even make posts about earnings calls entertaining.  And when he is blogging at things like TechCrunch40, his stuff is just awesome.  If you haven't read &lt;a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/"&gt;Eric's blog&lt;/a&gt;, go check it out now.  It has been really impressive how quickly his blog has become one of the standard bearing tech blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bookend to Shameless Self Promotion Month, I should mention that over the summer I funded a great company called &lt;a href="http://www.jaxtr.com/user/index.jsp"&gt;Jaxtr&lt;/a&gt;.  Jaxtr is what I like to think of as "social telephony."  You can put a Jaxtr widget on your blog, social network, eBay listing, etc. and enable click to call.  Jaxtr then establishes a virtual phone number for you that is local for the person calling -- if someone is calling you from India, they get a local India number, same in Europe or China or Iowa.  And because the number is virtual and lives on top of a voip platform, you can then control the destination of those incoming calls.  It can come to your cell phone, your home phone, Jaxtr voicemail, whatever you prefer.  Better yet, you can determine the path of the call by individual.  These features are just the beginning for Jaxtr, which will increasingly take advantage of voip and the social graph (oh crap, I swore I wouldn't use that term) to create more control, leverage, cost efficiency and fun for users.  I'm thrilled to be involved with the company (along side many of the earliest Skype investors).  Incidentally, I did get a fair number of comments and emails telling me that Shameless Self Promotion Month sucked and that I should cut it out.  Fair enough.  We now return to our ordinarily scheduled program of pontification and sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that's enough for now.  Sorry for the rambling.  It is good to be back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Splunk:  A Software Enabled Platform for Data Search</title>
<link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ventureblog/~3/148947983/splunk_a_softwa.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first met with the team at &lt;a href="http://www.splunk.com/"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;, they were working away on building a system that could accurately track a transaction as it traversed the entire enterprise stack.  If the transaction broke somewhere along the way, their software could help IT discover the cause of that failure.  While it was clearly a pain point for some businesses, there was no clear customer and the value proposition was a relatively hard one to articulate.  But the technology they were building created a whole lot of intelligence built on the fumes of the data center (namely the log files).  I was interested in what they were doing, but not interested enough to fund them.  One day I got a call from &lt;a href="http://www.splunk.com/company/247"&gt;Michael Baum&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Splunk.  He told me that they had "figured it out" and that we should meet up.  I was certainly game to hear what they had figured out and we got together again a short time later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what had Splunk figured out?  They had figured out that if they could track, manage and correlate log files across the entire data center in near real time, that they could create the killer IT Search Engine that would allow an end user to see into their enterprise stack in a way never before possible.  The Splunk guys showed me a very simple example using Voip data and how one could track all systems that touched a particular extension by simply searching for that extension in the Splunk engine.  I was an instant believer -- it was clearly a better way to manage the massive amounts of IT data that exist in enterprises today.  I invested in the Series A and the Splunk team got to building the software that they had envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time after investing in Splunk, I was meeting with a group of managers from one of August Capital's biggest Limited Partners (the folks who invest in our fund).  I was describing for them what Splunk was planning to build and they asked me "so what's the market size for that?"  I quickly answered as best I could -- "I have no idea."  Needless to say, this was not the most satisfying answer they had ever received and they stared back at me with a look that suggested perhaps I should come up with a better answer.  But the reality was that I didn't have a better answer.  Not because it was unclear if there was any market for what Splunk was building.  But, more importantly, because once Splunk had built their search engine, it was unclear what market they would go after.  I explained to my investors that Splunk had a number of multi-billion dollar markets in which they might play (management, compliance, BI, security, capacity planning, development, etc.) and the only question was which ones they would choose to go after first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That conversation with my Limited Partners was over two and a half years ago.  And since that time, the Splunk team has built precisely what they promised -- a large-scale, high-speed search technology for your data center.  But despite the fact that Splunk's software has been &lt;a href="http://www.splunk.com/index.php/predownload?d=progeneric"&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt; by over 100,000 users and despite the fact that there are now more than 350 paying &lt;a href="http://www.splunk.com/customers/1007"&gt;enterprise customers&lt;/a&gt; (including 21st Century Insurance, BEA, British Telecom, Catholic Healthcare West, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Comcast, Dow Jones, FedEx, Fiserv, GE Consumer Finance, LinkedIn, Mantech, Mozilla.org, NASA, Shopzilla, Telstra, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of State, Vodafone and Yahoo!), I would still have a tough time answering the question posed by my Limited Partner.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splunk has not built an application.  Nor is Splunk merely selling software.  Splunk has created a software enabled platform that continues to be extremely broadly applicable.  Is Splunk mission critical when it comes to maintaining availability of large scale enterprise systems?  Yes.  Is Splunk invaluable in the fight to maintain the security of your data center?  Yes.  Does Splunk uniquely simplify the process of data compliance?  Yes.  Can Splunk help you dig into your data and analyze it like no other solution?  Yes.  But, frankly, that's just the tip of the iceberg -- once you are able to query individual pieces of data across your entire data center in real time, the applicability of the platform is limited only by the creativity of its end users.  And those end users are driving value back into the platform, creating applications we hadn't thought of before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the market for Splunk?  i still couldn't say for certain.  But I can tell you one thing -- it is awfully big.  And in the venture business, that's big enough.&lt;/p&gt;
