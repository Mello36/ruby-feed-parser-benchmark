    <description>    Above: Spicy’s favorite photo of the divine Miss Page. I am sad to report that the beautiful &amp; groundbreaking 1950s pinup, Bettie Page, has died at the age of 85.  Bettie suffered a heart attack last week and soon after fell into a coma.  “I want to be remembered as I was when I was young and in my golden times.  I want to be remembered as the woman who changed people’s perspectives concerning nudity in its natural form.”   We will miss you, Bettie.
