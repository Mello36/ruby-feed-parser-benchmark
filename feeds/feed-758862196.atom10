As one who never underestimates the Republican party, I won’t dispute that. But when Morning Edition’s Steve Inskeep asked about in-party criticism that the Republican party might consider distancing itself from the extreme religious right, Duncan actually said his is the party of the “big tent”. </p>
<p>Yeah. I just about choked on that one, too.<span id="more-3657"></span> The big tent? The Republican party? Really? I’d be surprised if even Republicans believed that. As I recently wrote for Virginia’s conservative <a href="http://www.commonwealthconversations.com/node/122">Commonwealth Conversations</a>, part of the problem we saw with Republicans during the past election season is that more and more Americans are falling out of the fold precisely because the Republican party isn’t speaking to them- literally.</p>
<p>I get that Duncan is trying to keep his job. I’m just not sold on his rhetoric. Afterall, saying you’re the party of the big tent doesn’t make it so. You have to actually put that into practice. Perhaps the elections of Gov. Bobby Jindal and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98116257">Joseph Cao</a> in Louisiana will move things along in that direction. It’s admittedly encouraging, in some ways, to see their success- particularly in the Republican party. And let’s be honest. The reason their success is so remarkable is because the Republican party isn’t perceived as being open to ethnic minorities. The party has a loud, if small (which is debatable), faction to thank for that. Maybe it’s changing. Maybe it’s a ruse. Only time will tell. And Democrats would be wise to pay close attention to how it all unfolds. </p>
<p>But ethnicity isn’t the only cultural battle the Republican party has to face. It is a good start, though. And if Republicans are really on that road, maybe Duncan isn’t crazy afterall.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we know what Obama’s priorities are, don’t we? And it’s good to see that health care, still, is one of them despite (or especially because of, to hear him tell it) the downturn in the economy.</p>
<p>Today, President-elect Barack Obama announced former U.S. Senator and Minority and Majority Senate leader, Tom Daschle will head up the new administration’s efforts to reform health care (upon confirmation). As Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and Director of the White House office of health reform, Obama said Daschle would be not just responsible for implementing a new health care plan, but also be the lead architect of that plan.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly interested in a debate of Obama’s decision to choose Daschle. No doubt many Republicans will find something in that choice to criticize; many Democrats will be fine with it. The more interesting thing (in my opinion) is that this was among the first high profile set of appointments Obama has made; the third following his economic and foreign relations teams. </p>
<p>It’s encouraging that health care is among Obama’s top priorities, especially given our economic dire straits. Obama clearly recognizes that the rising cost of health care is a major component of our financial problems, as individual families and households, as well as collectively as a nation. </p>
<p>&#8220;If we want to overcome our economic challenges, we must also finally address our health care challenge,&#8221; he said during his press conference this morning.</p>
<p>And, to that end, Daschle is the perfect man for the job. His commitment to health care reform is no secret. And he echoed Obama’s thinking about the relationship between health care costs and our economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time that there is so much at stake, there is no question that fixing health care is and has been for many years our largest domestic policy challenge,&#8221; Daschle said. &#8220;Addressing our health care challenges will not only mean healthier and longer lives for millions &#8212; it will also make American companies more competitive, address the cause of half of all of our personal bankruptcies and foreclosures, and help pull our economy out of its current tailspin.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope he’s right.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://bearingdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/steven_chu_sidebar.jpg" title="Steven Chu" class="alignleft" width="125" height="250" />Though not yet announced, it has been leaked that Obama will be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/12/10/obama.energy/index.html">nominating Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Chu to be his Energy Secretary</a>. Dr. Chu is the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. For a post that, since created by Carter in 1977, has been a home to career politicians and bureaucrats with little to no experience in energy, this shows a refreshing break from tradition. Chu is a strong advocate for alternative energy policies, especially regarding their impact vs fossil fuels on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. I also believe that this is the first time in at least decades that an actual scientist has been tapped for a Secretary level position. For anyone potentially doubting the coming administrations commitment to reforming our energy policies and focusing on sources of renewable energy, this should be a welcome development.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/virginia/election_2009_virginia_governor_election">Rasmussen released a poll earlier this week</a> showing that all four candidates for governor are not only close heads up but that nearly a third of those polled don&#8217;t know enough to hold an opinion yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rep. Brian J. Moran of Alexandria is the only one of three leading Democratic hopefuls who beats Republican Attorney General Robert F. McDonnell in a straight match-up, 41% to 37%, according to a new Rasmussen Reports survey of Virginia voters. Five percent (5%) favor some other unspecified candidate, and 16% are undecided.</p>
<p>McDonnell, who is expected to be his party’s unchallenged gubernatorial nominee, runs dead even with Rep. R. Creigh Deeds of Bath County at 39% apiece. Four percent (4%) prefer a third candidate, and 18% aren’t sure. This is a repeat match-up for the two since McDonnell defeated Deeds for attorney general in 2005 in a race so close it required a recount.</p>
<p>Deeds is also the favorite among Democratic voters who will select a gubernatorial nominee in a June primary.</p>
<p>The best-known of all four candidates, longtime Clinton confidant and fundraiser Terry McAuliffe, trails McDonnell 41% to 36%. Five percent (5%) like another candidate better, while 17% are undecided.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moran&#8217;s numbers may reflect the strength of Northern Virginia, but that Deeds is favored by his party but only breaks even is an interesting stat.</p>
<p>Also key to note is McDonnell&#8217;s standing among independents - he beats all Democrats heads up among unaffiliated voters - and that his favorables and unfavorables beat every Democrat heads up as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Forty-nine percent (49%) of Virginia voters have a favorable opinion of McDonnell, with 18% saying their view of him is very favorable. He is viewed unfavorably by 19%, with 32% not knowing enough about him to have an opinion one way or the other.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Deeds is regarded favorably by 37% of Virginia voters and unfavorably by 24%. Thirty-eight percent (38%) have no opinion of him.</p>
<p>For Moran, his favorables are 33%, his unfavorables 31%, with 36% having no opinion.</p>
<p>McAuliffe, who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005, is seen favorably by 36% and unfavorably by 34%, with only 30% undecided about him.</p>
<p>All three Democrats are viewed Very favorably by 11% of Virginia voters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, it&#8217;s hard to take any polls at face value eleven months out from the actual election and with only one debate under their belts.  But the Democrats are going to face a tough fight for the nomination and those unfavorables - 24%, 31%, 34% - are only going to go up if things get ugly.</p>
<p>Deeds is in the best position being outside of Northern Virginia.  Moran and McAuliffe are fighting over the same base and while neither can outright ignore the rest of Virginia, they have more ground to cover there than Deeds would given his roots.  So if Moran and McAuliffe eat each other alive, Deeds can come right up the middle and beat both of them out fairly unscathed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Del. Lionell Spruill has me wondering why he isn&#8217;t Governor of Illinois.  It&#8217;s all about the Benjamins, it seems.  After making headlines for endorsing Del. Brian Moran for Governor, and raking in $7,500 a month for the honor, he announced this week that he endorsed Jon Bowerbank for LG.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2008/12/bowerbank_hires_spruill_spruil.html">Washington Post</a>, Spruill is getting the cashola on that nod as well.  Bowerbank&#8217;s campaign manager wasn&#8217;t even sure how much they are paying him (wouldn&#8217;t want to contradict any upcoming filings, eh?).</p>
<p>That just leaves one question.  Which Democrat for Attorney General will cough up the cash to &#8220;earn&#8221; Spruill&#8217;s support?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Governor of Illinois who was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081209/ap_on_re_us/blagojevich_corruption_probe_22;_ylt=An4T1sDj08zln8zoC7uAI0fCw5R4">arrested today on corruption charges</a> for trying to sell Barack Obama&#8217;s Senate seat, to which he can still appoint a successor from his jail cell, is showing us a great history lesson.</p>
<p>Before the 17th Amendment, this likely happened all the time.  State legislators appointed all US Senators, and except for the many times that they deadlocked and didn&#8217;t send anyone to the Senate, accusations of bribery and corruption abounded.</p>
<p>There have been several calls to end the popular election of US Senators, arguing that with that change went the last vestiges of states rights and any state check on federal power.</p>
<p>But the brazen actions of Democrat Rod Blagojevich (&#8221;I want to make money&#8221;), and the fact that he can still exert his power, tells me that while the 17th amendment on balance was a good thing.</p>
<p>Imagine if he appoints himself!</p>
<p>Impeach him.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><del datetime="2008-12-09T04:42:19+00:00">Today is</del>Yesterday was the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, a terrible day in American history, whose conflict largely ended in devastating atomic attacks on Japan.  Makes me wonder in today&#8217;s world when would we use the nuclear option.  If a group of terrorists set off a dirty bomb, would we respond in kind?  If so, against who?  What if a country launched one against us?  What would be the best thing to do?  I truly hope that we never have to answer these questions but seeing how India and Pakistan tensions can bring them to the brink of war it is an issue we need to figure out.  </p>
<p>On a side note, want to give my thanks again to all those who serve.  I have the pleasure of working the military on a daily basis and I see first hand their hard work and commitments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The party out of the White House picks up seats in the midterms.  The party out of the White House wins the race for Governor of Virginia.  These decades-long patterns have led me to feel a certain confidence about a Republican rebound.</p>
<p>I just didn&#8217;t expect it to begin before Obama even takes the oath of office.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081207/ap_on_el_ho/louisiana_congress">Two GOP wins in Louisiana</a> with an ousted Democrat in a heavily Democratic district.</p>
<p>Not bad for openers.  Hint to Advancers - quit fighting with Republicans and defeat Democrats.  If you accomplish only that, you&#8217;ll make a quantum leap towards having the success Louisiana is celebrating today.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://bearingdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/autofail1.jpg" alt="" title="autofail1" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3610" />So the 3 stooges of Detroit decided to drive their hybrids to DC for their second visit to Congress.  They even tried to dazzle us by making us think the <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/electriccar" target=_blank>Chevy Volt</a> is close to reality by driving it for <a href="http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/081204-GM-CEO-Drives-a-Chevy-Volt-to-Washington-Sort-Of/" target=_blank>just the last few miles</a>.  So the Big 3 companies saved a lot of money on this trip by not flying those luxury private jets right?  <strong>No!</strong>  The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Autos/story?id=6402552" target=_blank>CEOs took luxury jetliners back to Detroit from DC</a>!!!!  So I’m guessing they decided to spend even more money to fly the jets empty to Reagan National until the hearings were over so these gentlemen wouldn&#8217;t have to go back the way they came.  Seriously, I didn’t really care they took the jets the first time but if you’re going to make a point of not taking a luxury jet then don’t do it!</p>
<p>Back in the 80’s, Chrysler was in the gutter much like today but they had a CEO in Lee Iacocca who had a vision of how to turn the company around and the saying <em>“If you can find a better car, buy it”</em>.  This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y4hfBfUyg8"  target=_blank>1984 Chrysler commercial</a> is worth watching because it makes you wonder why don’t the car companies learn their lesson.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Y4hfBfUyg8&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Y4hfBfUyg8&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>I’m liking a lot of what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQqGtm2kWpM"  target=_blank>Senator Corker is saying</a> about how the union has to make real concessions and the companies have to make difficult decisions but I’m not confident the Congress and White House will do the right thing here.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should start shortly, hopefully my computer has enough juice.</p>
<p>Panel is hosted by Cyrus Krohn, RNC e-Campaign Director.<span id="more-3586"></span></p>
<p>Party is further along technologically than the press would have us believe.</p>
<p>Krohn is from Fairfax. Nice.</p>
<p>Obama captured 13 million emails. RNC and McCain possessed 12 million emails (about 6 million each).  Almost parity (though no word what DNC&#8217;s list has).</p>
<p>Host 30 state party websites with email platform, they provide those emails to the party for free and website hosing services for free. Seeking to provide applications to parties that aren&#8217;t on their service to gain access to their database.</p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s talking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">Long Tail</a>. Long tail represents internet and new blogs. Easier to use to communicate as it&#8217;s easier to find them, harder before they&#8217;re scattered.</p>
<p>Text &#8220;join&#8221; to 46708 to join the RNC text list.  Will contact you based on area code so MD zip gets MD updates (sorry, Krystal).  Eventually may narrow to zip code (vendor issue).</p>
<p>Communication: online presence to empower activists and spread message. Internet will not win elections for you, candidate will.</p>
<p>Video is a must have. Talks of finding camera for a couple hundred bucks to spread message/track. I recommend <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8480716&amp;st=flip+camera&amp;lp=1&amp;type=product&amp;cp=1&amp;id=1185268654578">$150 Flip</a> for quick and easy entry level video.</p>
<p>Obama ran a flawless online campaign. Feels we need to get online offline - capture their hearts and minds online and get them on the streets.</p>
<p>Network via FaceBook, MySpace, YouTube, Twitter, etc.  Tap into viral effect (friends inviting friends).</p>
<p>Showed how you can use Twitter to update your Facebook. Just friended him, if I was already his friend I&#8217;d have IM&#8217;d him on FB and shown it on the big screen. Ah well.</p>
<p>Questions on how you can tell if folks click links and should you get a younger crowd to set it up and run it for you.  Awkward answers.</p>
<p>Bloggers do not adhere to same journalistic standards as media. You need to be conscious of what people are saying about you.  Recommends <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com">Google Blogsearch</a>. Hasn&#8217;t hit on message control yet.</p>
<p>Cites Google Bombing, which isn&#8217;t as big as it used to be due to an algorithm shift.</p>
<p>Question on how to properly respond to bad blogs or figure out good from bad.  I ended up speaking up, find the diamonds in the rough, as time goes by the cream will rise to the top, will shift to the big head of the long tail, and you can use THOSE guys, ignore the trash, trust the diamonds.</p>
<p>Sorry for the break, I ended up going and talking to the group, I forget what I said.  My bad.</p>
<p>Shilled <a href="http://www.redstormpac.org">RedStormPAC</a>, was told by a guy in the back they weren&#8217;t here to hear me, undersood.</p>
<p>Google search ads for cheap. Which a lot of folks need to know more about - you can advertise for pennies a click. DON&#8217;T LET THE OTHER GUYS BUY YOUR NAME OR KEYWORDS - great point.  Same with domain names. Protect yourself.</p>
<p>A lot of questions on what to buy and how much to spend to protect yourself online: domains, search terms, advertisements, etc. - how to track who visits and reply to them directly.</p>
<p>RNC marketing campaigns:</p>
