So there are a few things that I've read about during the week that have kinda have made me think "Thumbs Down to that".</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.chipdamage.com/archives/603"><![CDATA[<div class=""><p>Hello, again. Nice of you all to join me on this day. On time with this blog, thank you, thank you! So there are a few things that I&#8217;ve read about during the week that have kinda have made me think &#8220;Thumbs Down to that&#8221;.</p>
<p>I personally want to start with the whole Bethesda thing and with Fallout 3. They recently have announced on their site and the Fallout official web page that the <a href="http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/home/pr-112508.php">PC and X360</a> versions of the game will be getting updates and patches as well as the new expansions. Apparently it was announced also before the games release that the PS3 version would not be getting expansions. Does this make me angry? Normally, yes it would. Considering I spent my time trading in my games and pay 13 dollars to get the game. Spend 40+ hrs on finishing the game and stuff. I&#8217;d like to see some expansions. But alas, I don&#8217;t get any and I&#8217;m not really that angry. Since I know Bethesda was just doing their job and that Microsoft just offered a lot more money than Sony did. Thumbs down to the decision to never release it on the PS3 even before the game was released on the console.</p>
<p>If they decide to release some sort of things like Oblivion, I&#8217;ll probably trade in my copy for a used copy of it. I won&#8217;t be boycotting Bethesda for this decision, but I&#8217;m slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>Next I&#8217;d like to say &#8220;Thumbs Down&#8221; to sore losers in HD Remix. You know the ones that call you a bitch or cheesy or just drop the game while you have them in the third rep of a noogie trap (That jerk!). Sure it&#8217;s fun to make them rage quit and taunt you, but come on. Don&#8217;t be a complete and utter sore loser and take it out on a note. You&#8217;re just saying that stuff because you&#8217;re safe behind your TV/Monitor. If you saw a 5 foot 10 Korean guy who&#8217;s kinda chunky playing you, would you say that? I don&#8217;t think you would. (This part does not apply to the people I play locally).</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been playing too much lately, trying to put in Resistance 2 into my PS3, but it always just pops out and in goes Fallout 3 again. Wow, that addicting! Don&#8217;t get me wrong Resistance 2 is a good game, but I think I&#8217;ll enjoy it with an HD screen and playing it on 720p.</p>
<p>Last Saturday was a great time for a majority of us since we actually got to test out the system link for Left 4 Dead. Let me tell you, you NEED two HD screens, the horizontal split kinda sucked ass. We must have stayed on there for like 3-4 hours trying to beat No Mercy on Advanced (At least that&#8217;s what it seemed like). I vote for next time that we try a tactic like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy940e-4BLE&amp;watch_response">this</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XL5TS5HX_I&amp;feature=related">this</a> (The latter one requires sniper skills!) Good stuff though. We need to do it more.</p>
<p>Anyways I&#8217;m pretty much done with this article, I&#8217;ve probably missed out on a few things that I wanted to talk about. But I&#8217;ll leave that for later. As for gatherings, I think something is going down on Saturday or something or maybe Friday, depends on what&#8217;s going on. Drop us a line or something in the Gatherings Thread on the <a href="http://www.chipdamage.com/forums">forums</a>. Well I&#8217;m out, GGPO players.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.chipdamage.com/archives/584"><![CDATA[<div class=""><p>Well, it&#8217;s late Friday night (11pm to be exact), and I thought it be about time to make an official blog post concerning the new &#8220;Media&#8221; section that&#8217;s been up since early this afternoon.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s exactly what it sounds like. A section where we place our videos from events and such. This includes matches, as we do record the finals at our tournaments.</p>
<p>Right now, you will find two sections currently up. Matches for &#8220;Fight for the Future 2&#8243; and &#8220;That Summer Tournament 2007&#8243;. I assure you, more will be added in the future. Before I forget, I&#8217;d like to thank ShinAkuma (Shane) for not only recording these matches with his equipment, but also uploading it to youtube. He&#8217;s been doing it for much longer than I&#8217;ve been a part of Chip Damage.</p>
<p>Anyways, check out the media section and expect future updates. Alternatively, click below on one of the banners to have a look.</p>
<p><a href="/media/fftf2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-536" title="fftf2matches" src="http://www.chipdamage.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/fftf2matches.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="100" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/media/tst07"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-570" title="tst07matches" src="http://www.chipdamage.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tst07matches.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="100" /></a></p>
<p>Last but not least, you will notice that there are no videos uploaded from TST3, our last big summer tournament. We did record the match finals, I assure you that. We also recorded crowd footage. So what&#8217;s the hold-up on posting the videos?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it officially here. Yes, there is an official TST3 DVD in the works, and nearing (as game producers would say) &#8220;gold status&#8221;. This does not mean the videos will not be uploaded. They will sometime after the release of the DVD. That said, they will also be cut and labeled.</p>
<p>There is no official date for the release yet. Right now, it is on a &#8220;It will be done when it&#8217;s done&#8221; schedule. But, personally, I am pushing for a pre-Christmas release date.</p>
<p>One last thing I should mention. Keep your eyes on the front page for the TST3 DVD teaser, coming soon. And that&#8217;s my queue. Enjoy the new part to the website and look forward to some new additions.</p>

This is ridiculous, guy who posts the mosts blogs and he&#8217;s falling behind. There are a few things that I guess I should cover this week. The big one would be:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fight for the Future 2: Revived</strong></span></p>
<p>This tournament went extremely well, all things considered. We set up pretty much like TST III, I&#8217;m very grateful to have a good team that runs things along side with me. Also, I&#8217;d like to thank Ariel from <a href="http://www.machineinterface.com">Machineinterface.com</a> for giving us more prizes and making ours look like crap, just kidding. I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who came out, especially the newer players. I appreciate your support to the scene. I hope to see everyone in the next year where we&#8217;ll have at least 5-6 events planned. Especially with the new slew of games coming out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to also say that the staff of the SSGA/Chipdamage.com did very well this tournament. Our final one of the year and we have Duong &#8220;nYo&#8221; Phu taking out Shane &#8220;Shinakuma&#8221; Fleury in ST for the number 1 spot, Matt &#8220;ckasady&#8221; Lehotsky getting 3rd in ST. Then in 3S we had Tyler &#8220;Kang&#8221; Sanderson and myself place in the top 4 (4th for Tyler, 2nd for me). Honorary member/staff Steffan Fields being able to do what he does best and placing top place in nearly every game. Awesome job you guys. For more results/videos and details, go the <a href="http://www.chipdamage.com/forums">forums</a>.</p>
<p>The other topic I&#8217;d like to discuss is the arrival of the long awaited:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo: HD Remix</strong></span></p>
<p>Wow, it took a very long time for this game to come out. I mean FOREVER. I&#8217;m thankful to have heard the news that the PS3 would be getting it before the X360 because of Thanksgiving on Thursday. My fellow staff members, sans Jayse, were able to gather together on Tuesday and play long hours of local gameplay of the game.</p>
<p>The game looks fantastic, with a few graphical flaws in my opinion, but otherwise great. The actual game is great fun, since the rebalanced mode really does change things. I was actually winning more games than I usually do in that game. It&#8217;s a great game to play online as well, many people to challenge and stuff, especially on PSN (People should head to the SRK PS3 boards to find challengers).</p>
<p>I honestly say that Dhalsim/Boxer/Dictator/Cammy are top on my list. Others have their own opinions, which is great since the game is still very much playable. Akuma kinda sucks now, but I guess it had to be done. Other than that I have nothing but praise for the game. Get it as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to discuss:</p>
<p>Nothing else really. I&#8217;ve been addicted to Fallout 3 and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m almost done the game. With FFTF2 done I&#8217;m pretty much done with 3S as well. STHD Remix will pretty much what I learn for SFIV. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more things to discuss about for our future. We do have things planned I&#8217;ll tell you that much. We&#8217;re also gonna be trying to get a podcast or something going locally. Simply because we just don&#8217;t see them that much around here. Okay, well I think that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m gonna go back to Fallout 3, GGPO gamers.</p>
<p>James &#8220;Korea&#8221; Kim</p>
<p>P.S. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re gathering this weekend, we probably are, but just make sure with Duong or something.</p>

I really really wanted this jacket, but with everything that&#8217;s going on. I can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t be able to get it. Hopefully they&#8217;ll re-release it and I can get it sometime later in the coming year. PLEASE TRIUMVIR, RE-RELEASE THAT JACKET!</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m one day late with my normal Wednesday update, and almost 2 days late too. I&#8217;ve been busy with other things. School has pretty much made my weeks a living hell hole, especially with Fight for the Future II this Saturday. Can&#8217;t let it get to me though, more school = more pay = more money = SHADOWLOO JACKET!</p>
<p>Fallout 3 has pretty much taken my gaming time as I&#8217;m rarely seen on 2DF or even playing games when we have the gatherings at Duong&#8217;s. I&#8217;m mostly sitting around playing the games for 360 (aka Gears 2 and Far Cry 2 or L4D) or just chatting. Which leads me to conclude the following:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I am completely screwed for Fight for the Future!</strong></span></p>
<p>Do I really care? No, not really, simply because this is our last tournament of the year, and the final showings of some games. Oh who am I kidding, I do care, but it&#8217;s just that so many other games have entered my life. Not that I&#8217;m deterring from Fighters, but I&#8217;m trying to keep myself occupied until SFIV.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something though about Fallout 3 (Sorry if my blog seems to move from one place to another). Fun game, I strongly suggest you get it for 360, PC, or PS3. It&#8217;s worth it, unless you hated Oblivion and such, because it&#8217;s practically that, but with GUNS! GUNS AND MORE GUNS! Who doesn&#8217;t want to be scared shitless by things like Mole Rats and Big Ugly Mutants. I do admit though, the AI for your allies SUCK, they don&#8217;t know how to use cover for ANYTHING. Kind of reminds me of Oliver and watching him play Gears 2. If they would have just fixed or tweaked that, maybe my dog wouldn&#8217;t have died!</p>
<p>So other than that, I&#8217;ve been playing nothing else really. I&#8217;ve been scouring the webpages and stuff for other information, but nothing comes to mind. So many games coming up this year that it&#8217;s just making my mind explode. Reading Tyler&#8217;s (Kang) blog did make me shed an invisible tear, as most of what he said is true. Oh well. Oh wait, one thing I found out. STHD is coming out for PS3 one day earlier than 360, EAT THAT BITCHES! And we get the OST for free! YEAH YEAH!</p>
<p>No gatherings this week for gaming, or maybe there will be some practice going on tomorrow in the Science Lounge if we can get shit set up properly. Other than that, see you guys on Saturday. (By the way, be there for about 12 - 1pm for some casuals and stuff.)</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.chipdamage.com/archives/397"><![CDATA[<div class=""><p>I originally had something else planned to write.  However, I realized that this is something I should probably state before the tournament.</p>
<p>This Saturday, our charity tournament, Fight for the Future will be happening.  This tournament is an important one.  Not just because the proceeds will go to charity.  This event will see the end of quite a few things for our tournament events.</p>
<p><strong>Dreamcasts</strong></p>
<p>Some of the staff have expressed desire to phase out DCs by the end of this tournament.  This of course, doesn&#8217;t stop any of you from bringing them to play casuals.  I expect Matt to continue issuing money matches in MVC2 and Shane showing us why he prefers Second Impact over 3rd Strike.  But this would mean the end of their use in official tournaments.</p>
<p><strong>Original Super Turbo</strong></p>
<p>It looks as though HD Remix will not be out for this tournament.  However, there&#8217;s a preeeetty good chance it&#8217;ll be out by the next event where we run a Super Turbo tournament.  For those worried that the remixed mode will become broken and unplayable, remember that HDR will also be including the original unchanged game with nothing more than the new graphics and music.  The game uses the same code as the Dreamcast version so it would otherwise be the same game we&#8217;re playing right now.  This is of course a hypothetical situation as we will be using the remixed mode by default.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Strike as the main event</strong></p>
<p>3rd Strike will always have a special place in our hearts (well, most of us).  However, Street Fighter 4 is going to soon become THE game to play.  Although we&#8217;ll continue to host 3S tournaments so long as the support for them is there, SF4 is going to end up taking the priority.  It&#8217;s also going to likely take 3S&#8217;s comfortable 6:00 pm timeslot.  We&#8217;ve consistently held 3S tournaments at that time due to it&#8217;s prime time status and to give players a consistent time to be used to.  Come SF4&#8217;s launch, expect it to take that spot.</p>
<p><strong>One of the games being held</strong></p>
<p>For this tournament, we will be hosting five games.  The most we&#8217;ve held in a single day tournament ever.  It&#8217;s already going to be a massive workload and it&#8217;ll be completely impossible to run all these tournaments in the future.  Something is going to get cut for the next multi-game event.  It&#8217;s important that you show your support for the game of your choice this event.</p>
<p>Smash Bros Melee is the last game you can expect to disappear.  It has a unique style, unique platform, unique players, unique everything.  With the exception of TST &#8216;08, it continues to have the most entries in any of our tournaments.  We&#8217;ve already shown that we will not compromise this game because of Brawl.  Even if Brawl ends up seeing support, we try our best to continue running this game so long as the support is there.</p>
<p>Whereas SSBM is the least likely, Capcom vs SNK 2 appears the most likely to lose it&#8217;s spot.  It&#8217;s a major shame in my view, considering we literally just got a bunch of dedicated players who highly support this game.  However, it unfortunately doesn&#8217;t draw the same numbers that 3rd Strike does.  The fact that it takes so much longer (both in match lengths and converter inconveniences) doesn&#8217;t help matters.  Even if it does survive, the possibility of DCs being phased out means that this game might be expected to be transfered over to PS2s/PS3s anyway.  There&#8217;s still the realm of possibility that more will pick up this game and 3rd Strike will completely die down by SF4&#8217;s launch but that&#8217;s unknown at this point.</p>
<p>Super Turbo is going to be replaced by HD Remix.  Therefore it&#8217;s essentially going to be a &#8220;new&#8221; game anyway and on a newer platform.  It also has the advantage of taking much less time to run than any of the other games we hold.</p>
<p>3rd Strike will continue to see support from the staff so long as it continues to see support from the players.  It still has the advantage of nearly everyone in the scene being able to play it in some fashion.  Like someone on SRK stated, many old school players hate 3S because it plays so differently from other Street Fighters.  However, that&#8217;s precisely why it&#8217;s going to last for a long time.  On the other hand, some of the SoCal players have stated that ever since SF4 has been released, 3S doesn&#8217;t feel relevant anymore.  Does this concern us?  Only if you want it to.  Just be aware that we&#8217;ll continue to host tournaments for this game in some fashion if you still want to play it.  Still, it will no longer take priority.</p>
<p>Soul Calibur 4 is also in the danger zone.  We all know that I personally like 3D fighters (including this one) and I do want to hold at least something to fill the 3D void (Tekken players just aren&#8217;t coming to our tournaments) like the way we continue to support Smash players.  Still, the game doesn&#8217;t seem yet as though it may be a big draw.  TST&#8217;s tournament was free entry and BaseLan 16 didn&#8217;t draw (although there are many reasons for that).  FFTF will be another big test for this game.</p>
<p>If you want your game to continue seeing tournaments after FFTF &#8216;08, be sure to come this Saturday and show support for it.  If you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll survive, be sure to come for it may be your last chance to show your stuff in your game of choice.  As always, anything can happen.  For all we know, we could see a resurgance in Tekken, Guilty Gear or even&#8230;&#8230;.King of Fighters.  We will support where the competition is.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.chipdamage.com/archives/391"><![CDATA[<div class=""><p>For screwing a lot of people over with your &#8220;new&#8221; by-law! If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, then let me give you the summary.</p>
<p>The new trading in games by-law in Manitoba (and only in Manitoba for the moment) is that you pretty much can&#8217;t get anything free anymore by just trading in games. That means no free systems with 6 games, no 2 games 1 free game, NONE of that exists anymore in good ol&#8217; Manitoba.</p>
<p>So what DO we get?</p>
<p>Well the government pretty much said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want people getting games and/or systems tax free, that&#8217;s not good for us&#8221;. So here is their answer to that (Well at EBGames at least):</p>
<p>- <em>You can only trade in software FOR software, doesn&#8217;t matter which platform it&#8217;s for, that&#8217;s all. You cannot exceed the value of the game you&#8217;re purchasing. If you do, you have to pay at least 1 dollar from your own pocket and then any credit left over MUST be used towards something else, even if you only have 4 dollars left. There is no Edge card anymore.</em></p>
<p>So lets do an example, of this, I&#8217;ll use what I did yesterday. You go in with a handful of games, you look at the game you want. You go up and say &#8220;I wanna trade these games for this game&#8221;. They&#8217;ll be like &#8220;Ok, let&#8217;s value your games&#8221;. So the amount of games I traded in were 117 dollars. Now I wanted Resistance 2 for the PS3, so I ask him for it. He says I should get another game. Which is reasonable, I have 117 dollars afterall. This is basically his push for the whole use your credit all in one shot (So that means if you wanna buy ONE game, take in about 10 games, since I had 21 to trade in). So I bought Fallout 3 as well. Total of both games came up to about 130 dollars. This is pretty good considering now I only have to pay 13 dollars for 2 brand new spanking PS3 games.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go back a bit and let&#8217;s change my total to 116 dollars to allow my credit to go over my total. If this happened, I have to now pay 1 dollar, at least, to pay for the games and then I get 1 dollar left over in credit. And I have to USE that 1 dollar or take my losses.</p>
<p>This is pretty much the same for hardware, only hardware can be traded in for hardware. I didn&#8217;t have any hardware to trade in, but I&#8217;ve got a feeling it&#8217;s a big hassle for that too.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t exactly what I call a good deal anymore, for the customer OR the retailer. Blockbuster won&#8217;t even offer their trade in 4 get a free game deal anymore. I asked and they said they got rid of trading all together at the Kenaston location. What does this mean for Future Shop when it starts trading in games as well? Who knows. All I know is, we all got screwed over.</p>
<p>So, I got Resistance 2 and Fallout 3 yesterday for a nice amount of 13 dollars. Not bad if you ask me, brand new games and they&#8217;re about 6.50 a piece.</p>
<p>So I popped in Resistance 2 first and man, I can say that I haven&#8217;t played an FPS on a console for a LONG time. Controls are gonna be hard to get used to, the game so far is pretty good, ample amounts of weapons, unfortunately the enemies are small sometimes and I find myself shooting aimlessly in the air trying to hit them. Also, it&#8217;s really annoying to have cloaked enemies in the game that can kill you in one hit start to shut off cloak when they&#8217;re 2 feet from you. I can&#8217;t tell you HOW MANY BLOODY TIMES I died to it. Online multiplayer is pretty cool. The co-op missions are little objectives that you do with other ppl (up to 8 players) and you get to choose between a heavy weapons guy, soldier, or medic. Each time you hit something with your weapon, you gain XP, which then unlocks new abilities or weapons. Pretty neat. The 30 vs. 30 is really good too, provided you don&#8217;t get trapped in a server with a bunch of 10 year olds.</p>
<p>Fallout 3 is interesting as well, I&#8217;ve never played the first two Fallouts, but I remember hearing about this RPG that you utilizes guns and stuff. So getting this was kind of a way of closure from the past. Anyways, the game is made by Bethseda, the same guys who did Morrowind and Oblivion, and it seems to follow the same type of engine, which can and cannot be annoying, since FPS mode is really bland and third person mode kind of stinks too. Other than that, the moral choices you make and such make the game a lot like a futuristic, non-kiddy version of Fable/Fable 2. I&#8217;ve <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">just started the game</span> restarted the game, just to change a few things I did in the first time through thing. I&#8217;ll have to see where I go from here, I want to be a charismatic, gun totting, scientist!</p>
<p>Other than that, I think that&#8217;s all I have to state today in this week&#8217;s news. The gaming gatherings are happening this weekend I believe. I will be missing at least one of them to hang out with a friend whom I haven&#8217;t seen in a while. 2 weeks until Fight for the Future 2, let&#8217;s gets some practice in before hand guys! Anyways, until next week, GGPO!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.chipdamage.com/archives/386"><![CDATA[<div class=""><p>My second column is, interestingly enough, inspired by a quick scroll through the forums. One of the first things that popped up in my mind was that the &#8220;Player Rankings&#8221; forum is&#8230;</p>
<p>Completely blank.</p>
<p>Part of this is because our tournaments have been somewhat few and far between in the past year or so. Dating back to November 2007, we&#8217;ve had 3 Third Strike tournaments, with one soon to come at FFTF II (and we hope to see all of you there), and even less tournaments for the other games. With some highly-anticipated releases in the near future (Street Fighter 4 and Super Turbo: HD Remix), I expect it to be somewhat of a breath of fresh air; everybody gets to start from scratch with SF4 and I look forward to seeing how the game evolves, and hopefully ST:HD will provide the right balance between the new players (who feel like they missed the boat on Super Turbo) and the old school guys (who get an opportunity to try to find some new tricks in the revised version of the game). I can&#8217;t say for certain what will be happening in the future re: tournaments and ranking battles (ranbats for you hipsters who like shortening things), but rest assured that we are looking forward to having new games available for competition.</p>
<p>Which leads to the second part of the puzzle; if there&#8217;s a competitive game, and we&#8217;ve got regular tournaments with good numbers for said game&#8230;how do we rank/seed the players? Ideally, we get a system that answers two questions: first, we should be able to assess who has had the best &#8220;season&#8221; (where the season is comprised of a series of tournaments that occur within, say, a calendar year). Second, if we&#8217;ve got X number of players who enter a tournament, we should have a good idea where it is appropriate to seed those players so that people get a fair shake, taking into account momentum/current level of play.</p>
<p>The two are distinct questions: for example, if Player A dominates the first five SF4 tournaments with a nice gimmick, but gets peaced out of the next five pretty easily once people figure out his trickery, one measure should say &#8220;Player A has had a good season&#8221; and the other measure should say &#8220;People have caught up to Player A; if we have a tournament coming up, Player A should be a middle-to-low seed&#8221;. Or if Player B has been leapfrogging other players recently after a modest beginning, we could say &#8220;Player B should probably be seeded fairly high at TST, but doesn&#8217;t have as many points this year as some of the other guys he/she has passed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ranking is more of a measure of past performance, whereas seeding is trying to measure present ability and predict performance for the immediate future. As such, seeding is much more of a gray area; and it&#8217;s not entirely perfect. It&#8217;s not really designed to properly account for counter-matchups (a situation where a mid-level player just seems to have a top player&#8217;s number) or the fact that what is &#8220;supposed to happen&#8221; doesn&#8217;t always happen (take it from somebody who won some money on the Giants this past Super Bowl). But it helps as an objective guideline to try to save those really good tournament matches for the end of the tournament rather than having them occur at the beginning.</p>
<p>Having set the table for our rankings (and having put most of the people reading this to sleep), it seems like a good place to leave this column for now. I think I&#8217;ll probably pick up this subject again a little closer to the start of ranking battles, and once we&#8217;ve ported over some of the old tournament results. In the interim, expect some reader e-mails to be answered in the near future :P.</p>

Whether it&#8217;s to get that perfect score, or that supreme combo. Unless you&#8217;re Tim &#8220;Mr. Street Fighter&#8221; Ho, he usually is able to expand a 2 hour session to an all nighter. It&#8217;s usually a topic of discussion for many gamers, you know that one question &#8220;How do you get good at &lt;insert name of game here&gt;?&#8221; As we all know most people who ask this tend to be those who reply, after you explain it, with &#8220;Wow, you should get out more&#8221; or &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re a complete dork/geek/nerd.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how different people will talk about how they practice and stuff. It&#8217;s usually different between people, since it&#8217;s much like learning in school. Some people just take longer than others, for example, what took me 2-3 years to do with Dudley took someone else maybe like 3 months. But then you&#8217;ve gotta see some of the things that affect that.</p>
<p>- How much time did they put into the game?<br />
- Were you using stick or pad? ( I simply ask this because some things ARE easier to execute on pad and vice versa)<br />
- Who were you playing against? (This can change a lot of things, if you constantly play a top player, you can learn things much faster than playing against a bunch of scrubs, simply put, you pick up bad habits when playing scrubs and it&#8217;s harder for you to get out of the bad habits)</p>
<p>If you guys read Duong&#8217;s (nYo) <a href="http://www.chipdamage.com/topics/winnipegmixup">Winnipeg Mixup</a>, you&#8217;ll see that all three interviews he&#8217;ll ask how you practice and such or how they got good. I think the majority said one of the 3 things above. So if you wanna get good at a game, fighter or not, practice does make perfect. Just don&#8217;t play so much to an all nighter type of thing. A couple of hours a day is pretty much all you need.</p>
<p>Okay, so onto the usual gaming news with other consoles. I recently downloaded the Mirror&#8217;s Edge demo off the PSN (Yes, I finally got my PS3 back), after watching Tyler play it on the 360. I can say it is probably one of the coolest FPS style games out there. It will probably make me sick as hell because of the motions. The soundtrack is also very cool, especially it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TERyxFfMqDk&amp;feature=related">theme song</a>. Still haven&#8217;t done much in terms of the PS3, no new games, been playing a bit more DMC4. Doing okay in it, sometimes the game gets so repetitive I just wanna throw the disc into a fire.</p>
<p>Resistance 2 and GoW2, I don&#8217;t know about you, but both look really good, and that&#8217;s coming from a fighter only type of guy. I&#8217;m actually impressed at the movements and just the great detail they went into making the game. I honestly don&#8217;t know how the controls are for the PS3, but I&#8217;m assuming that GoW2&#8217;s 360 port is easy to handle since the controller is so FPS based. Resistance 2, even though I didn&#8217;t really get to try the beta, I looked it up on Youtube, looks pretty damn good on a HD 1080p TV/Monitor.</p>
<p>No weekend gatherings this week as the normal group will be at <a href="http://www.allyourbaseonline.com">BaseLAN</a> this weekend (well Duong and Tyler will). If you are interested in playing games such as Soul Calibur IV and FPS games on the 360, please drop by and support them. Otherwise we will see you next week, or at Fight for the Future 2.</p>

<p align="center">Name: Russel Racca<br />
 Alias: Lickuid<br />
 Age 18</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 What games do you play?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I play Smash Brothers Melee, halo 3, and I enjoy playing rpgs </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 So you compete in ssbm and halo then?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I play SSBM competitively and i play halo for fun. Not really  serious with halo. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 How did you get into Smash?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I got into SSBM back in 04 when I saw world record times on  break the targets on youtube </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Nice. How did that inspire you to start playing competitively?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 It didn&#8217;t actually , but the advanced terms I had been reading  about on forums. I was wondering what they were but never really looked into  them until I saw a pro match on youtube. I decided to learn the advanced  techniques and started using them in my game play </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 How did you learn to do the techniques?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I learned most by watching an advanced how to play on youtube.  Some I read explanations of the forums </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Develop anything techniques on your own?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Not really my own techniques, but I&#8217;ve been able to incorporate  the falcon moonwalk into my game play, which not very many players do. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Who are your main characters?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 My mains are Captain Falcon and Falco. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Why do you main them?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Their combo ability on most of the characters. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 I&#8217;ve seen you use other characters to win before like young link.  Did you give up on them?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Pretty much , the use of higher tiers in tournaments and the  meta game make my young link pretty useless. I&#8217;ll use Young Link if it&#8217;s  situational though or if it&#8217;s against a scrub </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 What do you think of the current tiers for melee? Does it affect how  you select your character?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I agree with the current tier list. It somewhat affects how I  select my character, The only matchup I&#8217;m scared of is Falcon vs Sheik. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 How did you train to get to your current level?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Playing with my crew mostly. tournies also helped a lot because  of the experience with different players. i also improved a lot playing with the  central cali players, watching videos and reading matchups also helped </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 How did you do against the central cali guys?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I was able to keep up with them, our skill level was pretty much  the same. I went to a smashfest and we had a little 10 person tournament. i  placed 3rd </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Awesome, did you get to play anyone notable there?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Nope, they&#8217;re probably only known on smashboards , but nothing  big. They&#8217;ve had experience with the high level players , though </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Do you think the other top players in the city can compete against  other cities?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Definitely, honestly we are underrated just cause our name isn&#8217;t  out there. Wilson plays a beastly fox and I think I play a pretty high level  Falcon. That&#8217;s my personal opinion, Most definitely I think we can take on the  other cities for sure. We&#8217;ll find out soon when BC top player blunted object  comes to town, He placed 4th at the &#8220;At Melee&#8217;s end&#8221; tournament(Big Canadian  tournament). </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Who do you consider the top 4 players in the city? What do you think  makes them so good?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Top 4 would have to be Wilson Tieu, Janos Saluta, William Giang  and myself. Ii would place Adam Hayes there but he&#8217;s too inconsistent with his  play, No offence to him or anything. I think he&#8217;s still a very talented player.  Wilson is an insane player. He can pretty much play every character and dominate  with all the top and high tiers. Janos is a smart player and he&#8217;s been one of  the few to take Wilson out in tournaments. William plays a good Marth, he&#8217;s  really good at hitting the tippers. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 You&#8217;ve done very well in the tournaments here. Which ones of your  performances stand out</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I would have to say the most recent tourney(TST III). I got  knocked to losers pretty early and had to work my way back up to play Wilson in  the grand finals. I lost only 1 round in the first set , and taking all then  went undefeated in the second set. My Falcon was pretty boss that day. I&#8217;ve been  patiently waiting to watch those matches and see how well I did. I was in my own  zone that day and didn&#8217;t realize how bad I beat Wilson. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 How&#8217;d you hear about the competitive scene?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Jeremy had an account on smashboards and Rex invited him to  Baselan. Most of us couldn&#8217;t make it but Aris and my brother Nico went.</span></p>
<p>nYo:  <br />
 How do you prepare yourself for tournaments?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Before every tourney I play till like 4 am with whoever is at my  house. Normally Janos is the one I practice with. We have like little to no  sleep for every tourney </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 I dunno how you two manage to place so well with so little sleep.  What is your mindset when you&#8217;re playing in a tournament match? Do you play  differently from casuals?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Play to win. Play like a bitch if you have to, Just don&#8217;t think  about losing, don&#8217;t mess up most definitely. During casuals I like to play  around, it&#8217;s nothing serious but you get a feel from that persons play style and  how to prepare yourself for an actual tourney match </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 What are your thoughts on brawl?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 It sucks, It&#8217;s wack , there&#8217;s like no skill involved to win.  Metaknight is the most broken character ever. The gap between casuals and  competitive players skill isn&#8217;t very large. The only redeeming factor for brawl  right now are the hacks that have been made. So far there is no tripping. L  cancelling , melee air dodge (wavedash included) have been added, I still have  yet to try it out. Either way, melee will still be the better game </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Would you play brawl with the hacks that are coming out?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Once it&#8217;s polished, possibly. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Thats probably gonna be a tough thing for us to pull off. Who would  you consider your rival in the scene?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Wilson for sure </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 With new games coming out next year, anything else you plan to pick  up competitively?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 I&#8217;ve actually put some thought into street fighter 4. The game  looks promising, and a lot of my friends will be getting the game as well. I  could maybe start up a crew and play competitively. We&#8217;ll see though. Tekken 6  too, If I ever get a PS3. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 FYI both games are coming to 360. What are your plans concerning  melee over the next year? Planning to travel out?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Ohh well that&#8217;s news to me. I thought it was a ps3 exclusive.  I&#8217;ll probably go to California again. This coming summer and play with the same  guys. If I have enough money I&#8217;d go to Alberta where the &#8220;top players&#8221; are  located. </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Theres a group of us planning on heading to WCC2 in March care to  join us and show them what Winnipeg smashers are about.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 What is WCC2 exactly? Is there a smash tourney being hosted  there? </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Its Western Canadian Championships in Edmonton. I&#8217;d assume theres a  smash tournament if not you can at least play some of the players there.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 Ohh I would go then, we&#8217;ll have to see though , march is still a  ways away </span></p>
<p>nYo: <br />
 Agreed, lets conclude this with you talking some shit to other  cities, just kiddin, anything you&#8217;d like to say to the locals and others around  the country?</p>
<p><span style="color: #4ca9e7;">Lickuid: <br />
 To the locals - let&#8217;s get our name out there and good job  keeping the smash scene alive.To other cities - we&#8217;re good players, Don&#8217;t judge  us just because you haven&#8217;t seen us. A lot of your top players are overrated in  my opinion , but we&#8217;ll see when we actually play each other.</span></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.chipdamage.com/archives/341"><![CDATA[<div class=""><p>You may have came to our site as of recently and noticed something different. Perhaps you sensed that something was a bit off, not quite right. And then it hits you. Of course, it&#8217;s the hair, you got a haircut.</p>
<p>Well, I guess you could put it that way. Infact, we have a whole new theme, and I&#8217;ve already heard complaints the minute I put it up *cough cough Korea*. So for all those out there who enjoyed the last theme more, I&#8217;ll enlighten your curiosity as to why it was changed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to run all the reasons by you, but I&#8217;ll give you a brief explanation. The old theme was hard to maintain, buggy, and unsupportive of many browsers. It made it difficult and stressful to manage as we now have others who are posting on the front page. It was becoming messy and unorganized. The other reason was because it wasn&#8217;t my own. It was a tweaked theme of another, and if you bothered to read the fine print in the footer of the old theme you would have known that. It bothered me from the beginning to be using a theme that was not mine, but I didn&#8217;t have the time to think up a design myself&#8230; until now.</p>
<p>Which leads me to this. This theme is still a design I&#8217;m thinking up, even as I type this. Things will change over the course of the next couple weeks. It will become better. And as I mentioned to Korea, I will feed this theme to it&#8217;s viewers by the shovel until they love it, or choke to death.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s that, the new theme, for all to see. But I will tell you something, and I&#8217;m only going to say this once. &#8220;It&#8217;s a work in progress!&#8221; I still consider it to be in a beta phase.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. No need to explain the theme to you, you&#8217;re looking at it right now. Enjoy!</p>
