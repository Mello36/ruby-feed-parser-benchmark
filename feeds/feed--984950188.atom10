<p>Telling your story helps to separate you from the rest of the herd. </p>
<p>I suppose it&#8217;s no surprise to find an article about <strong>branding</strong> your farm, telling and marketing the story aspect of your agricultural production rather than relying on commodity pricing,  since I believe that &#8220;branding&#8221; got it&#8217;s name from branding cattle.   If you market a premium product, you may want to read this interesting <a href="http://www.cattlenetwork.com/Content.asp?ContentID=275310">marketing article from the cattle network</a> written by Dan Frobose of Ohio State.</p>
<p>It reminded me about a conversation from yesterday during a wonderful celebration lunch.  We were celebrating with Pat McKay&#8217;s business associates (she&#8217;s owner of an insurance agency that specializes in <a href="http://www.mckayins.com">insuring commercial embroydery business and non-profit organizations</a>), and while we were congratulating her on 15 years of business, we were also talking about the economy.</p>
<p>Someone asked how will high end, expensive businesses like Alpaca Farms make it during the economic downturn?  There are strategies to keep afloat, even during tough economic times.</p>
<p>If you are marketing a premium priced product like alpacas or the wonderful products made from alpaca wool, I would recommend reading everything that <a href="http://www.juliewassom.com/alpacas%20marketing.htm"><span style="color: #666666;">Julie Wassom </span></a>has published and written on the subject of marketing an Alpaca Farm.  She&#8217;s a marketing expert and an alpaca owner.  Although I don&#8217;t have any livestock to market, I have learned a lot from her newsletters, articles and ideas.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I was talking with 12 students in an <a href="http://www.resources-results.com/HotBox/press-30-0/press-details.html">Entrepreneurship class at Wayne College</a>.  Most the students are planning to launch a new product or service and many want to own their own business.  II was a guest speaker asked to talk about inexpensive but effective ways for marketing their products, services and businesses.</p>
<p>While we were talking it occured to me that there are at least 3 ways to invent a new product or service. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combine two popular ideas - </strong>If one idea works, maybe improving it with another makes it twice as good. </li>
<li><strong>Solve a Problem. </strong>Don&#8217;t create a product and then mass produce it.  Find out if there is a problem it solves.</li>
<li><strong>Ask your target market what they think: </strong>If you ask the people who will be buying it in the future, what their opinion is, you may save years and hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Don&#8217;t rely on the opinions of friends and family.</li>
</ul>
<p>My area of expertise is marketing it.  One of the ways we talked about marketing was of course on the internet.  I suggested that they learn to create their own website using Wordpress software.  If they set a static page to the main page of their blog, all of the suddent it&#8217;s not a blog with static website pages, but a website that has a blog on it.  Clever eh?</p>
<p>I predict as the economy shifts that we will see more and more entrepreneurs launching new businesses.  Are you starting a new product or adding a new service? </p>
<p> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I discuss blog marketing with business professionals, questions arise:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;How many clients have you got from blogging?&#8221; &#8220;Is it worth the time and effort?&#8221;</em>   <em>&#8220;Are you even sure if anyone is reading it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>To me, blogging is a whole different animal.  A blog extends the conversation. Here&#8217;s my responses to each question:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;How many clients have you got from blogging?&#8221;</strong> Most of my clients and potential clients are not the people reading this blog.  Most of my readers are already branding and marketing professionals who know as much as I do about the subject, and are reading to learn more, or different ideas on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Is it worth the time and effort?&#8221;</strong>   It is to me.  I&#8217;ve met some fantastic people I otherwise would not know.  I&#8217;ve gained ideas and insights from others, as well as been able to provide a forum for new ideas.  It helps me to stay current.  It&#8217;s a way for people to get to know me as well.  The value goes beyond networking, into idea expansion.  I can&#8217;t get the same effect from just reading websites&#8230; but reading and writing blogs really helps to unlock new territories.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Are you even sure if anyone is reading it?&#8221; </strong>I know people are reading it because of the increases in subscriptions. Because of the google analytical stats.  The blog is one of the main feeders into my website. Probably the most important way I know that people are reading it are by the comments.  While this blog is not the most conversational of the blogs on the web, I have about a 2 comment average for the 600 plus posts I&#8217;ve written.</p>
<p>Yesterday I learned about a clever comment counter and installed it on the sidebar.  Hat tip to <a href="http://www.meandmydrum.com/about/">Mark Sierra</a> at <a href="http://www.meandmydrum.com/">Me And My Drum</a> for the link to the <a href="http://www.successful-blog.com/">Liz Strauss</a> <a href="http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/liz-strauss-comment-count-badge-widget-wordpress/">Comment Counter </a>created by Planet Ozh.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are looking for a holiday gift for a friend who is a blogger or wannabe blogger?  May I suggest the <a href="http://stores.lulu.com/ageofconversation">AGE OF CONVERSATION 2:Why don&#8217;t they get it? </a>as a great gift.  Not only is it written by 237 bloggers, the profits go to charity.</p>
<p>Care to extend the conversation?  Leave a comment!! Thanks!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When should you rebrand your company?  Here are times when my company has been asked to lead the rebranding effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>The company was sold</li>
<li>The company was getting ready to be sold</li>
<li>there was a significant change in management</li>
<li>Focus was shifted to a new product line or service</li>
<li>The sales channel shifted to a different way of interacting with customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Rebranding is more than just updating a logo, refreshing a website or reprinting a new sell sheet.  It may involve a new potential customer list, a new system for providing estimates, and should include a system for tracking and analyzing sales results.</p>
<p>Rebranding means answering these questions first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is our target market?</li>
<li>Why should they care?</li>
<li>What is our unique competitive advantage?</li>
<li>How should we tell our story?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the best way to contact them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses evolve over time, but sometimes the branding and marketing efforts have to play catch up.  Does your business still have the old outdated tagline in materials that was &#8220;before ______&#8221;.  Maybe it is time to look at rebranding your marketing efforts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><em>The Story of Renewable Lubricants</em></h2>
<p style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px"><a title="Jackie Garmier by cmcbrown, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cmcbrown/3055188539/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/3055188539_f687b18ae3_m.jpg" alt="Jackie Garmier" width="217" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>On Friday I met Jackie Garmier when we were on a panel of entrepreneurs speaking at Kent State University during their &#8220;Hidden Gems&#8221; section of the Entrepreneur Extravaganza.</p>
<p>Jackie and her husband own a small business in Hartville, Ohio that provides lubricants that perform like synthetics for the racing industry.  She describes herself as a &#8220;farmer&#8221; and her production as a &#8220;recipe&#8221;, but she&#8217;s taking on the world &#8212; and she has the patents to keep her recipes proprietary.</p>
<p>She finds it easy to market her business because she is passionate about her brand.  She explains:  <em>How could I not love it?  We &#8211;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Design a bio degradable product</em></li>
<li><em>Help farmers grow more crops</em></li>
<li><em>Help her country reduce dependence on foreign oil</em></li>
<li><em>Reduce air pollution (the Kent State bus service uses her products)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Her company, <a href="http://www.renewablelube.com">Renewable Lubricants</a>, also uses soy based inks in printing and refillable, recyclable packaging wherever possible.  What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>Her message to other entrepreneurs: be passionate about your brand and carry your message throughout all of your products.   </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you struggle with branding yourself on line?  As a branding expert, I find social media challenging from a branding standpoint in that my name means something totally different to about 99% of the population under 30.  (In case you&#8217;re over 30 and have been living under a rock, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown_(singer)">Chris Brown</a> is an extremely popular hip hop, R&#038;B singer/entertainer.)</p>
<p>Imagine my delight when I found a website that can check, <em>in just seconds, </em> the availablity of user names on social media sites.  <a href="http://www.usernamecheck.com">Usernamecheck.com</a> helps you find out where your username is registered and checks user name availablity across multiple websites very quickly.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;ve decided to change my Twitter branding from CMcBrown to ChrisBrown330 which is both my area code &#038; my birthday&#8230;  http://twitter.com/ChrisBrown330.  I didn&#8217;t realize that it was so easy to change my name: <em>Change your Twitter user name anytime without affecting your existing updates, @replies, direct messages, or other data. After changing it, make sure to let your followers know so you&#8217;ll continue receiving all of your messages with your new user name. </em></p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://twitter.com/ristlist">Norma Rist</a> for telling me about it and <a href="http://www.techspikes.com/2008/11/check-username-availability-across-multiple-websites-with-username-check/">TechSpikes </a>for helping me find the link.</p>

<p>While sustainability of our people, planet and prosperity can not be compromised, somehow it is hard to &#8220;do it now&#8221; if the price seems just too high. </p>
<p>Pictured (left to right): <em>Terry Roberts, George Longcoy and Michael Sumpter from Johnstone Supply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Overcoming the Price Objection</strong><br />
One company who may have found a great ROI story to overcome the price objection to going green is <a href="http://www.johnstonesupply77.com">Johnstone Supply</a>.  I just heard about their motors with a variable speed control that can provide customers with an incredible 60% ROI in electricity savings in less than one year. </p>
<p>Tim Ferguson, a motor and pump specialist, explained how it works at a recent &#8220;Green Business&#8221; breakfast in Cleveland, where more than 250 business professionals met to discuss critical environmental issues facing Northeast Ohio, sustainable strategies and how to remain profitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The building we are in (Ritz Carlton Cleveland) has 380 motors as an example. Just one 20 horsepower motor that runs all the time uses $14,024 per year in electricity &#8211;assuming 10 cents per kilowatt hour,&#8221; he explained.  &#8220;By putting a $3,000 control on that motor, you would experience more than a $10,000 savings in just same year.&#8221;</p>
<p>With math like that, why everyone isn&#8217;t racing out to change their motors right now?? <em>Maybe they haven&#8217;t heard about it. </em></p>
<p>Johnstone Supply has a challenge to <strong>build awareness</strong> of the ROI solution with their potential customers.  The hardest part?  Often the person in charge of buying a motor is not the same person who pays the electric bill.  Both accounts payable and the facilities manager must be made aware of this ROI solution and work together.  I hope that many CFO&#8217;s in the room will go back to those two people in their corporation and ask to do the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Case Study: What to do</strong><br />
In an effort to build awareness, Johnstone Supply sponsored the event, got Tim Ferguson to become one of the panelists and placed their literature at each person&#8217;s seat at the event.  All this in an effort to help build awareness of their solution to the sustainability issue. I hope that whoever answers the phone in their sales department asks the question, &#8220;where did you hear about us?&#8221; so that they will know how much this marketing investment paid off in helping them to build awareness of their motor solution.</p>
<p><strong>What lesson can you learn from Johnstone Supply?</strong><br />
Does your potential customer have a problem?  How does your product or service solve it? And how do you let them know about the solution? You can&#8217;t just expect people to KNOW you have the solution, you have to build awareness of both their problem and your solution.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the lesson from Johnstone Supply: </p>
<ul>
<li>Work with a local organization to become a panelist</li>
<li>Prepare your talking points to clearly explain your solution</li>
<li>Be specific on the ROI and payback.</li>
<li>Have literature available at each seat to take back to the office.</li>
<li>Have other people from your company at various tables in the audience to help explain.</li>
<li>Offer a free analysis to help interested potential customers self qualify</li>
</ul>
<p> And, don&#8217;t forget to ask where they first heard about you in order to measure your marketing effectiveness!</p>
<p>Not knowing their marketing program&#8230; I would guess that they&#8217;d also include some press releases, direct mail pieces and search engine optimization techniques to make sure that this one marketing event investment pays them back a nice ROI as well!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I wrote about the differences between Gen X and Gen Y moms in their use of the internet.  I thought that Technorati&#8217;s David Sifry made some interesting points in <a href="Brands Enter The Blogosphere">Brands Enter the Blogosphere</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brands make up a major part of bloggers&#8217; online conversations. More than four in five bloggers post product or brand reviews, and blog about brands they love or hate. Even day-to-day experiences with customer care or in a retail store are fodder for blog posts. Companies are already reaching out to bloggers: one-third of bloggers have been approached to be brand advocates.</p></blockquote>
<p>I predict that this, combined with the shift of the mom demographics and the way they view online activities, will have far reaching implications for brands and their marketing managers.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how more and more brands will shift from offline activities to online activities to try to capture the attention of this next generation of Moms.  But it will be even more interesting to see the reaction of the Moms.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about the toy buying experience this weekend.  The holiday selling season is fully upon us in the stores.  Now that Halloween is out of the way, the stores are filled with wrapping paper, gifts, and Christmas music piped over the PA.  I could swear that I was even the smelling cinnamon, cloves and mulled cider wafting in the air.  All of this was intended to incite spending, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than 10 years since I left the toy industry, and I can&#8217;t help but think about how things have changed.  I was wondering how internet marketers are addressing the two generations of moms who are buying for their young children: GenX and GenY.</p>
<p>Each group has their share of toddlers, preschoolers, young children and tweens. These are the groups of women born between these years:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Gen X born: 1965 to 1982 (43 years old to 26 years old)<br />
Gen Y born: 1982 to 1994 (26 years old to 14 years old)</p>
<p>According to the US Census bureau, <a href="http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/79_births_and_birth_rates_by_race.html">most babies in the US are born to women ages 25-29.</a> Which means that in the next couple of years, the shift from Gen X moms to Gen Y moms is here.  It seems like this would be something of interest to marketers. This could be especially significant since the GenY group is a much larger group than the GenX&#8230; sometimes called the Echo Boom or Boomlet.</p>
<p>I found one study from Parenting.com&#8217;s survey of over 800 moms that explains how the two groups use the internet differently.  <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/interactive/gen-x-and-gen-y-moms-use-internet-differently-6006/?camp=newsletter&#038;src=mc&#038;type=textlink">GenY sees online activities much more integrated into their life, whereas GenX moms seem to use it more for specific tasks.</a>  Makes sense.</p>
<p>With the uncertain economy, it&#8217;s predicted that many consumers are tightening up their spending this year.  </p>
<p>I predict that marketers whose products are sold to moms and have authentically embraced the age of conversation, web2.0, blogging, twittering, facebook and social networking with the the GenY moms are going to have a much more successful &#8220;selling season&#8221; this year.  Marketers who insist on selling via TV advertising, printed holiday flyers mailed into the mailbox &#8212; and are wondering what the difference between Twitter &#038; TweetDeck is &#8212; will find their numbers slipping.</p>
<p>Let me know if you see any studies or know of a group studying this phenomonen.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px"><a href="http://brandandmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/state-map2.jpg"><img src="http://brandandmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/state-map2.jpg" alt=""  /></a></p>
<p>If you had a product to sell nationwide, at first glance you might consider blasting out mass media nationwide in big sweeping layers to coat the entire country.  This mass approach may have some merit.</p>
<p>But last night&#8217;s historic election showed that pinpoint marketing &#8212; focusing strategically on key segments &#8212; makes the difference. It&#8217;s not coincidence that most of the blue counties are where the Ohio cities are: Cleveland, Akron, Toledo, Youngstown, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati. This map doesn&#8217;t break it down by city or precinct, but that precinct-by-precinct focus was a key strategy for the Obama campaign.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had as many phone calls asking if I&#8217;m going to vote.  We even had someone drive into the driveway last Friday to make sure the 3 voters in my household had a ride to the polls.  It was a young man from my town whose Boy Scout troop meets at my church.  </p>
<p>A friend of mine told me the story of her daughter who is away in Vermont at college.  When she volunteered to make phone calls, she received a list of names and phone numbers of the neighbors from her street back home in Hudson, Ohio.</p>
<p>I think it was the strategic, affinity and close knit ties that made the difference in this election.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for your marketing?</strong><br />
Using referral sources who believe in your service and products. Testimonials from people your potential customer knows and trusts. Finding common ground with your potential customers.  No one wants to buy from a stranger, so how can your company become an acquaintance? A friend? </p>
<p>By the way, you can take a look at the individual county results in your state&#8230; just click on the individual states in the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26349526">2008 general election state results</a> map at this link.</p>
