If you are someone who appreciates art, an artist, a gallery or venue, or an educator <em>you need</em> to be a part of this organization. <strong>Register </strong>for the site at the lower right corner of this page and <a title="Register for forums" href="http://forums.arts-united.com/" target="_blank"><strong>register</strong> for the forums</a> as well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Oh yeah, I am aware that both of the calendars aren&#8217;t functional</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><sup>fixed!</sup></span>. I am in the process of setting up a full development site so you don&#8217;t have to witness the e-ugliness of the site in progress. I did, however; add a <a title="Events Calendar" href="http://arts-united.org/events/">full page <strong>Events!</strong> Calendar</a> (look up<a href="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/up.gif" rel="lightbox[82]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-99" title="up" src="http://arts-united.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/up.gif" alt="" width="30" height="30" /></a>to the menu at the top of the page). If you are an artist, a gallery/venue, or an educator with upcoming events, email the information to me. The <strong>Events!</strong> Calendar will be a collective of all events in the area. One stop shopping.</p>
<p>Do Art.</p>
