			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked out Hubspot&#8217;s <a href="http://hubspot.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6e84768fa3ed8a8123c211d94&#038;id=8c1a0eda66&#038;e=DiHs2Notto" target="_blank" >video</a> on Inbound vs Outbound marketing you should check it out. Cool tune, even cooler concept but does Inbound Marketing work?</p>
<p><img src='http://www.b2bcalltoaction.com/wp-content/uploads/inbound.gif' alt='Inbound' borders="0" /></a></p>
<p>The idea of having a constant flow of inbound leads is great, but is it really possible? As relatively easy techniques like blogs and social media sites generate and direct relevant prospects to a company&#8217;s website, what <strong>MAGIC </strong>do you use to filter and capture high-quality visitors? Calls to action of course.</p>
<p>Creative calls to action are the key to realizing value from inbound marketing. It is not enough to generate traffic (unless you are paid for website hits) but you must find <strong>and </strong>convert high-quality visitors.</p>
<p>To answer the initial question; of course Inbound Marketing works as long as the marketer understands that inbound activity is only one part of a two part play.</p>
<p>Visit your own site as a potential, serious customer and ask yourself: Would I respond to these calls to action or simply abandon the site?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our clients is seeing some interesting underreporting by Google Analytics. We know it is underreporting because we can see exactly how many leads (email addresses) we are capturing with EchoQuote and GA is showing 40-50% fewer &#8220;landings&#8221; than are actually occurring.</p>
<p>After researching the issue, it seems that it may be related to the fact that Google Analytics requires javascript to work. Many end-users have tight security on their machines and may not allow the urchin.js script to run.</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this behavior?</p>
<p>It really does not affect us because we are capturing live conversion activity that does not require javascript and our numbers are accurate. However, since most marketers are lead quantity driven versus lead value driven (which EchoQuote uses) it would be helpful to understand why it is happening.</p>

<strong>Why Most B2B Websites Don&#8217;t Work</strong> (by Brad Fallon)</p>
<p>The problem with so many web sites today is that they are built around an advertising model – but the wrong kind. As a result, business owners are throwing away money hand over fist when they could be pulling in tons of qualified, interested prospects and customers.</p>
<p>If you want your web site to capture more quality leads, this article is for you. You see, there are two types of advertising, but only one kind of web site. Unfortunately, most web site designers don’t seem to know this.</p>
<p><strong>Branding vs. Direct Response</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do open-ended or long-term marketing engagements scare you? Are you hesitant to engage a top-notch marketing firm for fear of &#8220;scope creep&#8221; that can drain your marketing budget? If so, you may be interested in a fresh approach; <strong>fixed price marketing services</strong>.</p>
<p>Most small and medium size businesses (SMBs) know they can benefit from experienced marketing firms for traditional as well as internet based services. The problem, however, is that most small businesses don&#8217;t have a huge marketing budget that allows for open-ended, time based services.</p>
<p>Now there are less risky options for purchasing specific marketing services based on a &#8220;buy-only-what-you-need&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>One example is Vancouver, BC based <a href="http://www.intersectionconsulting.com">Intersection Consulting</a>; a full service marketing concern that has taken the fear out of acquiring marketing services by offering pre-packaged services at a fixed price. From basic offerings like Market Communications, Website Development Management, Google Ad Campaigns to advanced services like Brand Management, Intersection offers fixed price packages.</p>
<p>To make it even easier on potential clients, Intersection Consulting now provides <a href="http://www.echoquote.com/portal.php?&#038;refsite=intersectionconsulting&#038;source=eqblog" target="_blank">Self-Service Pricing</a> so potential customers can determine budget fit before contacting them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All marketers are familiar with Calls to Action (CTA) used to motivate a prospect to take action. In the pre-internet era this usually manifested itself as a &#8220;Call our 800 number.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 800 number is certainly still in use today but is gradually being replaced with the more modern &#8220;Visit our Website&#8221;. For many companys, 100% of their marketing spend is focused on driving traffic to their website and good SEO/SEM processes can help with traffic. However, once visitors arrive at the Corporate website the hard part begins; qualifying and converting the prospect.</p>
<p>Is there a magic formula for creating a CTA to filter serious prospects and convert them to leads?<br />

As a relatively new player in the world of internet marketing, I am very selective about where I spend my time and who I spend it with. Last year I learned a lot at MarketingSherpa&#8217;s Demand Creation Summit. This year, the Inbound Summit just seems to &#8220;fit&#8221; and it got me thinking about synergy between Hubspot and EchoQuote.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last Fall&#8217;s MarketingSherpa Demand Creation Summit there was a specific track laying out a basic B2B sales cycle from start to finish. Although every organization will have a variation of the model, it is a good starting point to understand how organizations can improve their sales by understanding <strong>what </strong>customers are looking for at the different stages of the decision process and then <strong>providing </strong>it. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the model in a nutshell:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.b2bcalltoaction.com/wp-content/uploads/b2bsalescycle.gif" target="_blank" /><img src="http://www.b2bcalltoaction.com/wp-content/uploads/b2bsalescycle.gif" width="400" height="133" alt="b2bsalescycle.gif" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Earlier is better</strong></p>
<p>Ask any B2B VP of Sales the question &#8220;does your sales team have a better chance of winning business if they engage the prospect early or late in the sales process&#8221;; you will get 100% saying they need to engage early.</p>
<p>Of course they do. If the sales team can engage early then it can influence the decision (function) criteria. So why does Marketing fail to filter and capture these &#8220;future customers&#8221; during the Research phase?</p>
<p>The problem has become that marketing has fewer and fewer unique reasons (Calls to Action) for a prospect to reveal themselves so they continue to pile on more of the same stuff (whitepapers, webinars and case studies) without any noticable effect on lead generation.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the definition of insanity, &#8220;doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result&#8221;.  Do marketers who have created saturated sales websites really expect serious prospects to fill out a form for &#8220;more information&#8221;?</p>
<p>So, what is left in the Research Phase to incent the serious B2B prospect to engage?</p>
<p><strong>Budget Fit and Decision (function) Criteria, that&#8217;s what</strong>.</p>
<p>How are you handling these 2 &#8220;needs&#8221;?</p>
