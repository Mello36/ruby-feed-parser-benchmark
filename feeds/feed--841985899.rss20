      <title>Bush sanctions last-ditch rescue plan for GM and Chrysler</title>

A spokeswoman for the US Treasury, which controls the TARP fund, said: "We will stand ready to prevent an imminent failure until Congress reconvenes and acts to address the long-term viability of the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM also announced today that it will slash production by a third in the first quarter of next year and temporarily close 21 factories as it scrambles to conserve costs in the worst sales market for 26 years. As result it will make 250,000 fewer vehicles in the first three months of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to the situation told Guardian.co.uk that the manufacturers, who could be days away from filing for bankruptcy, were "working very hard with the administration" to secure a compromise. GM indicated in a statement today that the TARP  is its main hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are encouraged by the White House's willingness to consider other options, including the TARP program, for immediate aid to the domestic auto industry," said GM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Bush and the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, have resisted using the $700bn TARP as a funding source for the auto giants, but they blinked today as it became clear that GM and Chrysler had no other outlet. Paulson has $15bn left to allocate in the first $350bn tranche of the fund, which was set up with the explicit mandate of helping troubled banks and financial services companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under one scenario outlined by analysts today, the TARP money could be used as a government guarantee that would underwrite bank loans to the ailing manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government can ask the banks to make these loans to the industry and pledge that it will guarantee them,. That safeguards the original purpose of the TARP and it is more palatable than giving the money directly," said Aaron Bragman, autos analyst at IHS Global Insight. However, the White House would not give a deadline for striking a bail-out deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Stock Exchange opened nervously with the Dow Jones index shedding 1114 points to 8451 by the afternoon – a fall of 1.3%. GM, Chrysler and the third member of the so-called "big three" Detroit-based auto giants, Ford,  employ around 250,000 people directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford, which is the strongest of the three, has warned that it will be endangered if GM and Chrysler go bust because parts of their shared supply chain will also go under as a result. Fears that a bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler will therefore have a ripple effect through the US economy have been weighing on investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the leading Republican opponents of the bail-out package, senator Bob Corker, said he regretted the collapse of the rescue legislation in the Senate on Thursday night. "We were three words away from a deal. That's what kills me," he told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corker said those words were a date for when GM and Chrysler workers would accept wage reductions to bring them in line with rival manufacturers such as Toyota. Republicans had demanded those reductions by next year and accused the United Auto Workers of rejecting that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Gettelfinger, President of the UAW, said "working for nothing" would not help GM avoid bankruptcy but he admitted that the union would have to make concessions in order to secure a federal bail out. If the White House intervention succeeds it will tide over GM and Chrysler until March 31, who have warned that without the $14bn they will go bankrupt before January. That would leave the drafting of new bail-out legislation to the incoming President Barack Obama and a reconvened Congress and Senate that will have even stronger Democrat representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the rejected rescue deal, President Bush would have a appointed a "car tsar" to oversee the restructuring of the big three, who are asking for a total of $34bn including the $14bn for GM and Chrysler. The government would have received options to take sizeable equity stakes in the companies in return, as well as imposing tight controls on executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, rebel Republican senators balked at the terms of a bill that was passed by Congress but encountered stiff resistance in the Senate, where Republicans have stronger representation. They demanded  concessions that included the removal of a "jobs bank" that pays wages to temporarily unemployed workers, a sweeping debt restructuring and changes to a UAW health plan. Having reached broad agreement on those principles, the legislation then foundered on the proposed wages reductions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, analysts added that a new bail-out act could be based on the tentative agreement when lawmakers gather in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also reported today that GM has hired bankruptcy specialist Harvey Miller of New York-based law firm, Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges in case the White House talks fail. Miller's CV includes dealing with bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/automotive"&gt;Automotive industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/generalmotors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ford"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>British ambassador responds to German economic criticism</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/dec/12/germany-economic-criticisms</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/27753?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Politics%3A+British+ambassador+responds+to+German+economic+criticism&amp;ch=Politics&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Economic+policy%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union+%28News%29%2CGermany%2CUK+news%2CGordon+Brown&amp;c5=Middle+East+Travel%2CCredit+Crunch%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Nicholas+Watt+in+Brussels&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133097&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Politics&amp;c12=Economic+policy&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FPolitics%2FEconomic+policy" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain has registered its concerns with Berlin after the German finance minister described Gordon Brown's £20bn UK fiscal stimulus plan as "crass Keynesianism".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Michael Arthur, the British ambassador to Berlin, telephoned the German finance ministry to express Britain's displeasure after Peer Steinbrück intervened in a highly sensitive area of British politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disclosure of the ambassador's intervention came as European Union leaders reached agreement on a Europe-wide €200bn fiscal stimulus plan at their summit in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown today hailed the deal as a victory against the Tories – and, indirectly, Steinbrück – who have questioned the need for a fiscal stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's statement is the answer to all the talk of the last few weeks," the prime minister said in Brussels. "Europe is fully united, this is coordinated action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarks came as the foreign office confirmed that it was so concerned by Steinbrück's attack on the prime minister that the British ambassador had raised the matter with the German finance ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Berlin said: "The ambassador did call the finance ministry. It was to raise a number of issues and to register the fact that we did not agree with Herr Steinbrück. This was not a personal point. It was the politics of it: that we do not agree with his approach and the focus is what is going on in Brussels. Angela Merkel and Gordon Brown are working together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Miliband, the foreign secretary, indicated in Brussels that he was not aware of the ambassador's intervention, showing that Sir Michael's phone call did not amount to a formal diplomatic protest. But Sir Michael's decision showed that Britain was deeply irritated when Steinbrück took aim at one of the main measures Brown has adopted in response to the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finance minister sparked the row when he tore into Brown's £12.5bn VAT cut – the centrepiece of the government's £20bn fiscal stimulus package – on the grounds that it would saddle Britain with debt that will take years to pay off. He told Newsweek: "The same people who would never touch deficit spending are now tossing around billions. The switch from decades of supply-side politics all the way to a crass Keynesianism is breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I ask about the origins of the crisis, economists I respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades. Isn't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again, under all the public pressure?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row intensified on Thursday when the budget spokesman for Merkel's CDU party dismissed Brown's main response to Steinbrück – that Britain was caught up in a row between the SPD and the CDU, the two main partners in Germany's "grand coalition" government. Steffen Kampeter said, in a statement released by the Tories: "Peer Steinbrück's comments have nothing whatsoever to do with internal German politics as prime minister Brown has suggested. In questioning the British government's approach, Peer Steinbrück is exactly expressing the views of the German grand coalition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown brushed off the row today and said people should focus on the EU agreement on a Europe-wide fiscal stimulus plan. "This is a fiscal stimulus of 1.5% of our national incomes, around €200bn. It is in line with what will happen in the US and it includes support for judicious reductions in tax. Whatever comments have been made in the last few days – and I have not been privy to the domestic politics of any individual country – this is the answer: that Europe has agreed unanimously to take coordinated action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown hinted that there could be even more measures when the US president elect, Barack Obama, announces a more dramatic US fiscal stimulus package next month. "When next month a new president takes office in America, one who is also committed to fiscal action to cope with the economic slowdown, we will be able to work together and show that Europe and America can make changes that will benefit the economy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "The economic slowdown is a global problem that requires global action. That is why, in Europe and America, we are united in our belief that governments have a duty to act. We will continue to reject the do-nothing approach. We will not stand by and let the recession take its course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Europe has proved unanimously today is that it is ready to act in a united way to deal with the global downturn and to do so in an ambitious and coordinated manner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Global climate change decisions on hold for Obama administration</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/12/poznan-climatechange</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/98161?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Environment%3A+Global+climate+change+decisions+on+hold+for+Obama+administration&amp;ch=Environment&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Poznan+%28environment%29%2CClimate+change+%28Environment%29%2CEnvironment&amp;c5=Climate+Change%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CEthical+Living&amp;c6=David+Adam&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133375&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Environment&amp;c12=Poznan+climate+change+conference&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FEnvironment%2FPoznan+climate+change+conference" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN climate talks in Poland were edging towards a conclusion on Friday night, as ministers from 192 countries put the finishing touches to measures to fight global warming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks in Poznan were expected to make progress on helping poor countries pay to cope with the effects of climate change, as well as launch formal negotiations on a treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Miliband, energy and climate change secretary, said: "I'm more optimistic now then when I arrived here [in Poznan] that a deal is possible by the end of next year. It's not a done deal but I think it's do-able." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the talks had been given a boost with the news from Brussels yesterday that Europe had sealed a new target to cut carbon pollution 20-30% by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Poznan talks have made no progress on deciding new global curbs on greenhouse gas pollution, which scientists say are needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. Officials said new targets would not be discussed until the summer, to give Barack Obama time to signal his intentions as US president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, with another set of UN climate talks slipping by with no new agreement on global warming, we analyse the chances of a new deal over the next 12 months, and the likely approaches of the key countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overall situation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks at &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/poznan"&gt;Poznan&lt;/a&gt;, Poland, were never expected to make a significant breakthrough - the global deal is due to be settled in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/series/road-to-copenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen at the end of 2009&lt;/a&gt;. But even seasoned observers have been left downbeat by the lack of ambition. In a speech today, Al Gore claimed there had been "steady progress" but admitted it seemed "painfully slow".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the key issue of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbonemissions"&gt;carbon reduction targets&lt;/a&gt;, the main sticking point, the world is waiting for Barack Obama to make his intentions clear. Mexico announced plans at Poznan to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the EU has suggested beefing up its own 2050 target, from 60-80% cuts to a possible 80-95%, but such long-term promises will make little impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's scientists say that serious carbon reductions must start in the next few years, so any new global deal must set targets for around 2020. Such short-term goals are much harder for nations, because they demand immediate change in specific policy rather than vague talk of future technology improvements. This difficulty was in evidence in Brussels yesterday, when EU states finally agreed how they would achieve a 20-30% cut by 2020, but only after much hard bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The political process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/poznan"&gt;Poznan&lt;/a&gt; talks were the latest in an annual series of UN meetings, which were spawned by the Rio Earth summit in 1992 and produced the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. In Bali last year, nations agreed to negotiate a successor to Kyoto, to be signed at the meeting in Copenhagen. At the half-way point of that process, and with a new US president waiting in the wings, Poznan was always going to be something of a dead rubber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN circus now moves on to a series of meetings in Bonn next spring and summer, which should produce a draft Copenhagen text, though with significant gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem is the twin-track nature of the talks. Because the US is outside the Kyoto process, a new world agreement to include the US must be discussed separately from efforts to extend Kyoto beyond 2012, when its first phase expires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not scrap Kyoto and work on something totally new for everybody? The developing world fears rich countries would use that as a chance to escape from Kyoto's existing binding targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the UN meetings, a series of parallel events are planned for 2009. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has suggested two special summits on climate change, and Barack Obama could hold a similarly high level meeting once he takes office. Throw in the summer's G8 summit and a suggested extra UN global ministerial meeting to get the US up to speed before Copenhagen, and climate change will be rarely off the global agenda next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Copenhagen agreement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say a deal is needed at Copenhagen next December to give countries time to ratify it before the Kyoto agreement expires in 2012. A gap between the deals could destroy carbon markets, seen as an important route to reduce emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be considered a success, British officials say a new deal needs serious short-term targets for all rich countries, including the US, as well as some signal from large developing nations such as China that they will endeavour to reduce their own emissions. A number of supporting decisions on adaptation, financing and technology transfer are needed to make that happen. It's a big ask, and some have already warned it may not be possible — especially given the current financial woes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Europe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU's presence in Poznan was overshadowed by events in Brussels. Gore called the negotiations there a "struggle between hope and fear". The continent still has an official target to limit the global temperature rise to 2C despite mounting scientific evidence that this is unachievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;US&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration regularly stalled on climate targets. Barack Obama's team has yet to make its position clear, but has promised "vigorous engagement" at Copenhagen. Will want greater effort from developing countries, China in particular. The British team in Poznan said it was encouraged by the "enthusiasm" of the president-elect's team on the issue. But there remains a question mark over desire in Congress to sign the US to sizable carbon cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;China&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More aware of climate change than often given credit for. Likely to resist binding targets, but some pledge of future action will be needed to appease US. Has requested that rich countries pay 0.7% of GDP to poorer ones to help them adapt to the effects of global warming. Insiders say the Chinese delegation in Poznan was unwilling to discuss a EU proposal that developing nations reduce the rate of growth of their emissions by 15-30% over the next decade in return for 80-95% cuts in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has taken a hard line so far and voiced its opposition to legally binding targets.

      <title>Jean Charles de Menezes inquest records open verdict</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/dec/12/de-menezes-verdict</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/42357?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+Jean+Charles+de+Menezes+inquest+records+open+verdict&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Jean+Charles+de+Menezes%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CPolice+%28politics%29%2CUK+news%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Policy+Society%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Lee+Glendinning%2CSandra+Laville&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133233&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Jean+Charles+de+Menezes&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FJean+Charles+de+Menezes" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury at the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes today rejected Scotland Yard's claim that he was lawfully killed as part of an anti-terrorism operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banned by the coroner, Sir Michael Wright, from returning a verdict of unlawful killing, the five men and five women decided on an open verdict – the most critical that was available to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of answers to a list of crucial questions, they dismissed the testimony of the senior firearms officer who shot De Menezes – suggesting they did not believe the officer was acting in self-defence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury found that the firearms officer, C12, did not shout "armed police" before shooting De Menezes and that the Brazilian did not move towards him aggressively, prompting the fatal shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the De Menezes family, said the officers who claimed to have shouted warnings should be investigated for possible perjury. "There was certainly evidence of perjury by certain officers and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) should look at it again at this stage and I am sure they will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, De Menezes's cousin Patricia Armani da Silva said the jury would have gone further and recorded a verdict of unlawful killing "had they not been gagged by the coroner".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The jury's verdict is a damning indictment of the multiple failures of the police and the lies they told," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the jury leave Scotland Yard in turmoil. Sir Paul Stephenson, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner, said the force needed time to give "proper consideration" to the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the face of immense challenges faced by officers on that day, we made a terrible mistake – I am sorry," he said. "Our duty then as is now is to ensure that this organisation learns from the events to minimise the chances of it ever happening again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the criticism of police contained in the verdict, the De Menezes family – who were not in court after &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/dec/12/de-menezes-dramatic-scenes"&gt;last week's protests&lt;/a&gt; – accused Wright of "presiding over a complete whitewash". They plan to seek a judicial review over the omission of the unlawful killing verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a stinging attack on the former high court judge, they said he "failed on every count" in the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, offered her "deepest sympathy" to the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we have learned from the accounts of the tragic events that day reminds us all of the extremely demanding circumstances under which the police work to protect us from further terrorist attack," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquest at the Oval cricket ground, in south London, heard from 100 witnesses, including the two specialist firearms officers – known in court as C12 and C2 – who shot De Menezes dead at point-blank range on a tube carriage at Stockwell station on July 22 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Menezes was shot after being mistaken for the failed suicide bomber Hussain Osman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquest was the first time the public received a full account of the shooting from key witnesses who were in the train carriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting came two weeks after London was rocked by the July 7 suicide bombings, which killed 52 people. On July 21, a second gang of Islamist extremists triggered homemade rucksack bombs on London's transport system but the devices failed to explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As counter-terrorist police searched the city for those responsible, De Menezes was mistaken for Osman and shot dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven weeks of evidence, the coroner told the jurors to cast aside any emotion over the shooting. They were told to disregard protests from the De Menezes family and supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright said today: "It is only right that these proceedings conclude with me expressing sincere condolences to the family of Mr De Menezes. On any view in this case, this was a tragic and terrible event, the killing of an entirely innocent young man."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>De Menezes family criticise inquest as a 'whitewash'</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/dec/12/de-menezes-family-criticise-inquest</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/68456?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+De+Menezes+family+criticise+inquest+as+a+%27whitewash%27&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Jean+Charles+de+Menezes%2CPolice+%28politics%29%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Policy+Society%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Mark+Tran%2CJames+Sturcke&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133348&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Jean+Charles+de+Menezes&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FJean+Charles+de+Menezes" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of Jean Charles de Menezes declared the inquest into his death a "whitewash" today after the jury rejected Scotland Yard's claim that he had been lawfully killed as part of an anti-terrorism operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A family statement, released through the Justice4Jean campaign group, said: "After three months of evidence, 100 witnesses and millions of pounds, the coroner, Sir Michael Wright, has presided over a complete whitewash. He has failed on every count of the purpose of an inquest investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright had forbidden jurors at the inquest returning a verdict of unlawful killing. The jury opted for an open verdict – the most critical available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family's legal team confirmed it had launched a judicial appeal against the exclusion of unlawful killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Otone de Menezes, Jean Charles's mother, thanked the jury and said that she had been "reborn" by the verdict. Her reaction to the decision was read out during a press conference held by De Menezes's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am happy with today's verdict and would like to express my gratitude to the jury," she said. "Since the coroner ruled out the option of an unlawful verdict, I was sad. But today I feel I have been reborn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement the Justice4Jean campaign condemned both the decision of the coroner to rule out an unlawful verdict and the "gagging" of the jury from returning a narrative verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that if they had been left with the option of returning an unlawful killing they would have come back with that verdict," the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harriett Wistrich, the family's solicitor, listed a series of blunders in the police operation on the day of the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a tragic, tragic series of errors that could have been stopped if the police had done their job properly," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Independent Police Complaints Commission chair Nick Hardwick said De Menezes had "no opportunity" to defend himself and called for a review of operational procedures for police dealing with the threat of suicide terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now know there was nothing in his [De Menezes'] actions which justified his fate," Hardwick said. "He had no opportunity to defend himself or protest his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The inquest and health and safety trial have necessarily focused on the specific events of 22 July 2005. They have not examined the broader issue of how the police should respond to the threat of suicide terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I call again for this to have much broader debate and scrutiny by the public and their representatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, apologised for the killing but said the officers who shot the Brazilian "set out with the intent to protect and defend the public".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For somebody to lose his life in such circumstances is something the Metropolitan Police Service deeply regrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish once again to extend my profound condolences to the family of Jean Charles. They have suffered the most dreadful of losses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the suicide bombings of July 7 and the failed suicide attacks on July 21 had created a unique situation in the capital, with terrorists on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No-one set out that day to kill an innocent man. The coroner has ruled that, on the extensive evidence put to the court, this was not an unlawful killing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs de Menezes, who came to England for the inquest but has since returned home to Brazil, told the Press Association in an interview before today's verdict, that she believed some officers lied to the inquest and called for the resignation of Cressida Dick, the senior policewoman who led the operation that ended in her son's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After Jean was killed they started telling us lies," Mrs de Menezes said. "As a mother I would like to really know the truth about why they killed an innocent man. I wanted to be here to see with my own eyes, to hear with my own ears, because I wanted to know everything that happened that day. I wanted to know the truth and we want justice for this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most difficult thing to hear during the inquest was when the police officer said he shot Jean three times and his colleague shot six times at Jean. Everything that has been said during the inquest has been very difficult for us to hear. But those words were the most difficult. It was really painful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menezes, 63, and her other son, Giovani da Silva, 36, spent five weeks listening to key witnesses give evidence, but walked out of the court room after the coroner told the jury they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing. They flew back to Brazil at the start of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

Britain and Germany are leading the resistance. But something has to be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monuc force in Congo is to be increased by 3,000, but it will take months for the reinforcements to arrive. Amid reports of massacre, atrocities, and mass rape from the region, Human Rights Watch - which provided testimony of the massacre of 150 civilians in the North Kivu town of Kiwanja last month - urged the EU to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European Union should not wait for further killings to act. The current UN forces simply don't have the capacity or numbers to protect," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night Lord Malloch Brown, the Foreign Office minister for Africa, Asia and the United Nations, said: "Clearly we have felt the optimal solution was strengthening and transforming Monuc into something more able to do the job. The fact is we're not getting Monuc enlarged in the timeline hoped for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that if other European states wanted to contribute to Monuc or send troops to Congo alongside the UN mission, "then more power to them ... We are absolutely not going to be an obstruction." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU ministers also discussed an updated European security concept presented by Solana giving priority to the fight against terrorism - while Brussels counter-terrorist units were arresting 14 people suspected of links with al-Qaida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgian prosecutors said one of those detained might have been planning a suicide attack and did not rule out that the summit of 27 government leaders itself could have been a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solana's proposals last night for four different EU military missions to Congo followed a plea for help to Brussels from the UN secretary-general. Ban has asked the EU to command an armed mission for a minimum of four months to secure supplies for 250,000 displaced people in North Kivu and to protect civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would allow us to stabilise the fragile security environment and avert a humanitarian catastrophe," Ban wrote to Solana. He said the EU force should secure Goma airport and other strategic buildings, major population centres in North Kivu, and supply routes around Goma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rapid deployment of such a force would constitute a powerful political message that the entire international community is determined not to allow a further deterioration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the UK, Germany opposes sending its battle group, which is also on standby for deployment. Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and an apostle of armed humanitarian intervention, is keen for the EU to act, but diplomats are unsure if he has the backing of Nicolas Sarkozy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy"&gt;Foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/internationalaidanddevelopment"&gt;International aid and development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Senators accuse Rumsfeld over abuse of detainees</title>

They culminated in the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2003, where Iraqi detainees were found to have been forced into naked pyramids, sexually humiliated and threatened by dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration insisted the abuses had been the result of a few "bad apples" and that those responsible would be held accountable. The committee found neither those statements to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The abuses at Abu Ghraib, Gitmo [Guant&amp;aacute;namo] and elsewhere cannot be chalked up to the actions of a few bad apples," said the Democratic chair of the committee, Carl Levin. "Attempts by senior officials to portray that to be the case while shrugging off any responsibility are both unconscionable and false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other congressional report has pointed the finger of blame so squarely at Bush and his senior advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hearings in June and September, the committee heard testimony that allowed it to piece together the chronology of events leading up to the Abu Ghraib abuses. It focused its attentions on Sere, a training system used to prepare US soldiers for aggressive interrogations so that they might endure if captured overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The techniques were never intended to be used by US interrogators against their detainees. But in February 2002, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Bush determined that the Geneva Conventions should not apply to terror suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that ruling, techniques used in Sere training were applied against US detainees, and Rumsfeld gave his approval that December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/guantanamo"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Barclay brothers tell Sark: you didn't vote for us, so we'll take our money elsewhere</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/dec/12/barclay-brothers-sark-democratic-election</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/31930?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+Barclay+brothers+tell+Sark%3A+you+didn%27t+vote+for+us%2C+so+we%27ll+take+our+money+elsewhere&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Sark+%28News%29%2CChannel+Islands+%28News%29%2CLocal+politics+%28Politics%29%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CDaily+Telegraph%2CTelegraph+Media+Group%2CMedia+business%2CPress+and+publishing%2CMedia&amp;c5=Press+Media%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CMedia+Weekly%2CLocal+Government+Society&amp;c6=Steven+Morris&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1132890&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Sark&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FSark" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few precious hours there was a sense of jubilation and victory on Sark yesterday as, on a bright blue day, the tiny Channel island celebrated its first democratic election after 150 years of feudal rule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But joy turned to despair for many, and uncertainty for all, when the Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph and the Ritz hotel, reacted to their disappointment at failing to get their chosen candidates elected by announcing they were ceasing their multimillion-pound operation on the island and laying off 140 workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last night two hotels, shops, and at least one restaurant owned by the brothers, who live in a castle on a neighbouring island, were being closed. The brothers' building work on Sark also ceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon Dawes, the Barclays' Guernsey lawyer, said: "Sark will go back to what it was before the Barclays came and invested. The people of Sark have sent the Barclays a clear message and they feel they cannot work in a place where there is such an anti feeling against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The true sadness of it all is that the real loser will be Sark and, in particular, its workforce. But the Barclay family cannot be expected to continue investing at the rate of &amp;pound;5m per annum. I find it very hard, particularly at this time of year, not to wonder about the old saying to do with turkeys and whether or not they would vote for Christmas; well it seems we have our answer. I am genuinely saddened. The people of Sark have spoken." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Olsen, the senior politician on the island until the new parliament is formed, said last night: "We regret the opportunity not to be able to work through this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olsen, the first to vote when the poll opened on Wednesday, added: "I think everyone on the island is looking forward to building a better Sark that is good for everybody." One hotel worker, who asked not to be named, said: "It is devastating for us. Everyone thought this election was going to be a bit of fun - and good for the island. But it's turning out to be a nightmare for us." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a swift response to a disappointing, perhaps humiliating, day for the brothers. They have led the charge for democracy on the island which has been run by a largely unelected parliament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the election, two factions emerged. One backed the Barclays, who have greatly improved some of  Sark's hotels and other properties. The other faction liked things how they were and sided with the feudal "lord", the seigneur, Michael Beaumont, who is losing many of his powers and rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a bit of fun became  at times a bitter election, its importance underlined in the turnout - almost 90% of the 474 voters - and the number of candidates who stood: one in eight of the electorate. A recount was taking place yesterday because voting for the two candidates vying for the 28th and final spot in the parliament, the chief pleas, was so close. But the provisional results showed  that the Barclays' side had fared badly. One member of their team said: "We got our arses kicked." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the provisional results only two of nine people the Barclays had identified in a newsletter before the election as a "safe pair of hands" got in. Most humiliatingly, their man on Sark, estate manager Kevin Delaney, failed to win a seat. "That's democracy," he said before last night's decision. "There's a very real price that's going to be paid for this." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newsletter also identified 12 "establishment" candidates it said would "destroy" the future of island. But on the provisional result, nine of those got in. They included people such as Edric Baker, whom the Barclays' bulletin described as a "feudal talibanist" as well as Jan Guy, criticised because of a "socialist streak". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robust approach to politics did not go down well with many voters. Dawes claimed a "block vote" of about 200 had been "orchestrated" by the Barclays' opponents. One victorious candidate said the Sarkees were just better at politics than the Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a press conference yesterday , Sark's judge and returning officer, Lieutenant Colonel Reg Guille, was upbeat. "We have a healthy and thriving democracy," he said. But sounding defiant, he added: "We've welcomed people to live among us and accept our way of life. We are a very independent breed. We live and work by our own hand and long may it continue." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to say the island would not be "bullied", which was taken as another swipe against the Barclays by their people. They maintain that as the returning officer and judge he should not be making remarks of a "political" nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night Guille said he could not speak in detail of the Barclays' announcement but said it was "very disappointing". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the result - and before last night's announcement - Olsen and other members of the island's cabinet, met the Barclays' man, Delaney, at a hotel to try to find a way of working together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They clearly failed. But the brothers' lawyer, Dawes, said that there could be a reconciliation, if the islanders adopted a "sensible" approach. "The door is open," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now the doors of many of the island's businesses are firmly closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oh, brothers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Barclay brothers are joint 40th in the Sunday Times rich list, with an estimated fortune of &amp;pound;1.7bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• They own the Telegraph newspapers and Ritz hotel in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Sir David and Sir Frederick live on Sark's neighbouring island, Brecqhou, which they bought in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Born to Scottish parents, they grew up in London and left school early to work as painters and decorators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The pair first made their money in property in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• In 1983 they paid &amp;pound;45m for brewing and shipping group Ellerman, later selling its brewing division for &amp;pound;240m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Barclays entered the newspaper publishing industry in 1992, when they bought the European.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The twins bought the Littlewoods catalogue chain in 2002 for &amp;pound;750m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• They were knighted in 2000 for their services to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/sark"&gt;Sark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/channelislands"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/localgovernment"&gt;Local politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/dailytelegraph"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/telegraphmediagroup"&gt;Telegraph Media Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediabusiness"&gt;Media business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Press &amp; publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Guardian Daily podcast: EU summit on economy; plus police knives crackdown hailed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief political correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/strong&gt; reports from Brussels, where EU leaders are hoping to agree on a fiscal stimulus package. Gordon Brown and David Cameron have become embroiled in a split among the governing parties in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny new democracy of Sark in the Channel Islands votes against  the billionaire Barclay brothers. &lt;strong&gt;Steven Morris&lt;/strong&gt; reports from the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home Office figures show a dramatic fall in the number of young people carrying knives after a police stop-and-search crackdown. &lt;strong&gt;Alexandra Topping&lt;/strong&gt; reports from Hackney, east London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woolworths is disappearing from UK high streets after 99 years. We speak to shoppers snapping up bargains at the closing-down sale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Politics Weekly podcast: Saving the world with Gordon Brown – and Oliver Postgate</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/audio/2008/dec/11/politics-weekly-podcast</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we ask whether the prime minister's remark at PMQs that he "saved the world" was a Freudian slip. Political correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Allegra Stratton&lt;/strong&gt; thinks he can't possibly think he can save the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ask where the recession leaves the pre-election battle between the main parties after David Cameron confirmed that the Tories will cut public spending faster than Labour. Leader writer &lt;strong&gt;Tom Clark &lt;/strong&gt;thinks that both parties have moved to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we mark the death this week of Oliver Postgate, the creator of Bagpuss, the Clangers and Ivor the Engine. Postgate was also something of a serious political blogger. Senior political correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Sparrow &lt;/strong&gt;thinks his soup dragon may have been a parable for dispensing welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Simon Hoggart&lt;/strong&gt;, the Guardian's parliamentary sketchwriter, describes the scenes in the House of Commons where the subject of the recession this week provided an opportunity for the party leaders to try to outsmart each other.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cricket: Graeme Swann took two wickets in his first Test over as England dominated against India in Chennai</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/dec/12/england-india-test-graeme-swann-day-two-report</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/88270?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Sport%3A+Swann+on+song+as+England+take+charge+against+India&amp;ch=Sport&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=England+in+India+2008-09%2CEngland+cricket+team%2CEngland+cricket+series%2CIndia+cricket+team%2CCricket%2CSport&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CCricket&amp;c6=David+Hopps&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133232&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Sport&amp;c12=England+in+India+2008-09&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FSport%2FEngland+in+India+2008-09" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When England returned defiantly to India in the wake of the Mumbai atrocities, few imagined that they might have the capacity to overturn an Indian side that a few months ago sent Australia packing. But there is a distinct possibility that they might do just that. To turn up is one thing, to provide a turn up would be quite another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for England's jubilant dismantling of India's top order was Graeme Swann. A swansong properly occurs at the end of a Test career, but Swann, a great extrovert and not a man to be hidebound by tradition, chose to have his at the start. One over into his Test career, he had the wickets of Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid. It does not get much better than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The swansong, in any case, is a bit of a myth. Tradition has it that the mute swan is silent until just before its death when it bursts into song, but it does make noises. England's Swann snorted with delight when he had Gambhir leg before to his third ball, padding up, and honked incredulously when he spun his last ball beyond  Dravid's methodical defensive push for umpire Darryl Harper again to answer the appeal in his favour. That is only two half-centuries in 18 Test innings for Dravid and India is counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first ball felt like I had a ping pong ball in my hand,'' Swann said. "It was a terrible delivery. My mum could have hit it for four. Then it all went a bit crazy.'' After his second wicket he ran, "head spinning,'' towards cover to be engulfed in a bear hug by Andrew Flintoff. "I've known Fred since he was 11 and he was a big bruising lad then,'' Swann said. "But I wish he hadn't hugged me because he was dripping with sweat.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swann had been told that he was the first bowler in Test history to take two wickets in his first over. He was actually the second, Richard Johnson dismissing Mark Vermeulen and Stuart Carlisle in successive balls as Zimbabwe collapsed during Chester-le-Street's inaugural Test five years ago. Virtually the first time he turned on the TV in India last month after his arrival for the one-day series his faith was bolstered that he could make an impression. He witnessed a fellow member of the off-spin fraternity, Jason Krejza, take 12 wickets on debut against India in Nagpur. "It gave me great hope,'' he said. "Finger spinners don't get much of a deal in world cricket. I was determined to enjoy it.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England could not have imagined that six Indian wickets would have fallen by the close of the second day when Steve Harmison limped off after four overs with the new ball after feeling a twinge behind the right knee - he returned later with his pace only marginally curtailed – progress looked likely to be hard won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swann's intervention, James Anderson dismissed Virender Sehwag, exposing the technical flaw that England failed to take advantage of in the one-day series as Sehwag chopped on an 88mph delivery, among the quickest England bowled all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman added 61 with disturbing ease, Tendulkar bringing some perspective to Swann's day by slog-sweeping him for six. England's fielding was skittish. It looked ominous. Then England removed them in successive overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were return catches, reducing a crowd of 15,000 to mystified silence. Monty Panesar moved neatly to his right to hold Laxman – a catch which on a bad day he could have just as easily have kneed into the umpire – and  Flintoff, who had returned to hunt out Yuvraj Singh, found Tendulkar dead-batting his first ball straight back to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yuvraj's dismissal set the seal on a perfect day. Flintoff and Harmison would throw money in the beer kitty if it guaranteed that they could combine in the dismissal of a batsman not known for his false modesty. They did just that, Harmison's fullish delivery producing an edge that was held low by Flintoff at second slip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England extended their first innings into mid-afternoon, their last five wickets adding 87 in 38.4 overs against a predominantly all-spin attack as Mahendra Singh Dhoni opted not to take the second new ball. It was cagey stuff, but they made more than they must have feared after Flintoff fell without adding to his overnight score, gingerly pushing to forward short leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conscientious half-century from Matt Prior, 53 not out from 102 balls, edged them forward, an innings possessing only one flourish, a legside hit against Harbhajan Singh, and otherwise consisting of calm deflections. Harbhajan is a man of conflicting images. He has the grace of a ballerina on the field, but mischievous off it, having scoffed that England had batted too conservatively on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior did not take the bait. This was his first Test innings since the tour of Sri Lanka last winter when he also proved that he can play composed innings in adversity in sub-continent – his subsequent omission owed everything to his leaden displays behind the stumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson, who was badly dropped at slip by  Dravid, off Ishant Sharma when six, provided silky nightwatchman duties for 90 minutes before hauling to deep square. Only when Prior, on 47, was batting with the last man, Panesar, and showed no bold intent did Harbhajan seem to have a point about English conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/englandinindia200809"&gt;England in India 2008-09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/englandcricketteam"&gt;England Cricket Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/englandcricketseries"&gt;England cricket series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/indiacricketteam"&gt;India Cricket Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/cricket"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Music Weekly podcast: Metronomy and La Roux</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/audio/2008/dec/12/music-weekly-podcast-metronomy-roux</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life, it's a new edition of Music Weekly packed full of all the interviews and reviews you've come to expect. (Unless you've never listened before, in which case you may be expecting something completely different and slightly weird). Our main guest this week is Metronomy, aka Joe Mount, who pops into the pod and talks with Paul MacInnes about his flair for off-kilter pop and why he'd turn down Madonna (if she asked for production work, at least). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up, former man-about-town Tim Jonze talks to synth-pop star La Roux about getting emotional between songs, why taxi drivers don't understand her hairdo and, of course, how it feels to be hotly tipped for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exciting first, Paul MacInnes and Rosie Swash are joined by the Guardian's chief music critic Alexis Petridis to review the week's best new music. There's a fine remix of Grace Jones's William's Blood by Belgian outfit Aeroplane, the new Neon Neon single and Cat Power's most recent (and possibly last) covers EP. Last, but by no means least, king of squonk Michael Hann waxes lyrical about Guided By Voices in the feature with no name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instructions: you can listen to the show by clicking play above.

      <title>Golden Globe hopes for Winslet and Mendes</title>

Yesterday, their first joint project, Revolutionary Road - directed by him and starring her - received a slew of nominations at the Golden Globes, honoured alongside an unusually large array of British talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well on January 11, he could win best director, it could win best film, she could scoop best actress and her co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, could take best actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winslet has another chance to win the Golden Globe that has eluded her on five occasions: she is also nominated for best supporting actress for The Reader, in which she plays a former Nazi concentration camp guard who has an affair with a teenage boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Winslet-Mendeses are not the only couple up for awards. Brad Pitt is nominated for best actor for his role as the eponymous hero in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, who is born aged 80 and grows younger by the day, and his partner, Angelina Jolie, has a chance at best actress for The Changeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coveted best drama category, Revolutionary Road is competing against Stephen Daldry's The Reader and another British-directed film, Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. But the big competition looks to come from Frost/Nixon and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which both won five nominations. Doubt, which stars Meryl Streep as a nun who confronts a priest she suspects of abusing a black student, is also competing in five categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British talent was nominated in at least 20 of the 25 categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British actress Kristin Scott Thomas was nominated in the best dramatic actress category for her role in the French film I've Loved You So Long. It is her first Golden Globe nomination since 1997, when she was up for best actress for her performance in The English Patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other British women in contention include Emma Thompson for Last Chance Harvey, Sally Hawkins for Happy-Go-Lucky and Rebecca Hall for Vicky Cristina Barcelona. The last two are up for best comedy or musical, alongside Burn After Reading, Happy-Go-Lucky, In Bruges and Mamma Mia!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralph Fiennes has been given a best TV actor nod for Bernard and Doris, an HBO film in which he stars alongside Susan Sarandon. He is also a contender in the best supporting actor category for The Duchess, against the late Heath Ledger, who is favourite to win for his role as the Joker in the Batman film The Dark Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frost/Nixon is a big-screen version of Peter Morgan's West End hit, which recreates the 1977 standoff between presenter David Frost and the disgraced former president Richard Nixon. Morgan has been nominated for best screenplay, pitting him against fellow Britons Simon Beaufoy for Slumdog Millionaire and David Hare for The Reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Globes are typically seen as a crucial pointer towards the Academy Awards that follow in February, though they are not foolproof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's best drama award went to Atonement, while Sweeney Todd was named best comedy or musical. A month later, the best film Oscar went to No Country for Old Men. Sweeney Todd failed to even secure a nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/katewinslet"&gt;Kate Winslet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/bradpitt"&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/angelinajolie"&gt;Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/golden-globes"&gt;Golden Globes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/merylstreep"&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danny-boyle"&gt;Danny Boyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

Or, to put it another way, what price your dinner? How much are you prepared to pay to eat out? It's a pointed question particularly at a time like this, when money, as the sainted Mr Hucknall once said, is too tight to mention. At the end of last week's restaurant review I told you to look out for this week's review, because the bill would make your eyes bulge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well here it is, my &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/14/jay-rayner-helene-darroze-the-connaught"&gt;review of Hélène Darroze at the Connaught&lt;/a&gt; where dinner in the evening will cost you £275 for two, as long as you don't get too ambitious on the wine list. From long experience in this game I know this will drive some people nuts. Funnily enough I suspect the only thing that will make this review acceptable in some people's eyes is that I disliked the food so very much. It's a bad review of a restaurant that costs £275 for two. If it had been a good review of a restaurant that costs £275 for two that would be regarded as truly despicable. Which I think is a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some people – hell, a lot of people – who think spending significant sums of money on restaurant experiences is just plain wrong. I tackled this issue in my book, the Man who Ate The World and I'm not sure I can improve on what I said then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one reason for this and one reason only: we need food to survive. Therefore it is a necessity and to crash the plastic until it smoulders on a necessity is regarded somehow as wrong. Which is to completely misunderstand the point of restaurants and high-end gastronomy. Nobody goes to restaurants for nutritional reasons. Nobody eats hot smoked foie gras with caramelised onion purée to stave off rickets. They go for experiences, and what price a really top experience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's put it another way. How much would you be willing to pay to see your football team play in the FA cup final? £100 a ticket? £200 a ticket? £500 for a really good seat? You wouldn't think twice about it. A place in the front row for Robert de Niro on the stage?  A few hundred quid, easy. The chance to see Sinatra in his prime? Hell, you name the price. And what does that money buy you? Nothing but memories, and the right to say you were there. Serious gastronomy is no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case £275 of The Observer's money brought me memories of the wrong kind. That awful dish of sweetbreads roasted in astringent tandoori spices gives me nightmares. But I have had big ticket dinners paid for – whisper it – with my own money, which I thought worth every single penny. I treasure those memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So am I wrong? Is it simply impossible for a restaurant experience to be worth these sorts of sums? Which means I'm asking you whether you think I am deluded (form an orderly queue please). Or do we need to re-categorise them alongside once-in-a-lifetime Sinatra/De Niro experiences? Let the shouting begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/foodanddrink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/restaurants"&gt;Restaurants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Lack of snow takes the shine off Whistler's new Peak 2 Peak gondola</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/dec/12/peak-to-peak-gondola-whistler</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/9396?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Travel%3A+Lack+of+snow+takes+the+shine+off+Whistler%27s+new+Peak+2+Peak+gondola&amp;ch=Travel&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Skiing+%28Travel%29%2CCanada+%28Travel%29%2CSnowboarding+%28Travel%29%2CWorld+news%2CTravel%2CCanada+%28News%29&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CWinter+Sports%2CNorth+America+Travel&amp;c6=Tom+Robbins&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133228&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Travel&amp;c12=Skiing&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FTravel%2FSkiing" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been more than a decade in the planning and construction, but today Whistler's world-record-breaking  £28 million cable car finally opens to the public. The &lt;a href="http://ww1.whistlerblackcomb.com/p2pg/"&gt;Peak 2 Peak gondola&lt;/a&gt; stretches between the two separate mountains - Whistler and Blackcomb - that together make up North America's leading ski resort, meaning skiers no longer need to interrupt their day by descending  to the resort to get from one to the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never before has the opening of a cable car been the cause of such excitement and promotional activity. The resort is laying on a series of concerts and parties on the mountainside for paying guests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone in the resort is going to be cheering at today's opening ceremony though. Local powderhounds are filling up chatrooms bemoaning the fact that so much money has been spent on a lift that doesn't give access to any new skiing terrain whatsoever. All it does, they argue, is cut out the three-minute walk through Whistler village, from the bottom of one mountain's pistes to the start of the existing lifts up the other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Officials, however, are convinced it will give the resort a more European flavour, linking its disparate mountains into a unified whole, and will draw visitors to 2010s Winter Olympics here. Perhaps comparisons with Europe are unwise at the moment. For on its big, celebratory weekend, Whistler has a major embarassment on its hands - the lack of snow. Currently only a handful of runs are open, those are patchy and icy, and skiers are unable to ski back to the resort. Meanwhile the Alps are glorying in the best early conditions for at least 11 years - in Verbier, for example, they are having to use lorries to ship snow out of the village centre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that snow is forecast for later today - a dusting of powder would be the perfect finishing touch for the shiny new gondolas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resort officials, who have been working on plans for the Peak 2 Peak since the 1990s, see this as far more than just another ski lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is going to add a whole new dimension and really differentiate us from all the other resorts in North America," says Rick Temple, the construction manager for the project. "This is an new icon for the resort, and today is the most exciting day in my 40 year career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brochure produced to mark the big day goes further still: "The Peak 2 Peak is more than a world record setting icon, it is a testament to the human spirit… proof of the power of optimism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main record the gondola sets is for the longest span between pylons - 3,024m. It also claims the greatest distance from gondola to ground, 436m, although this has the caveat  "for a lift of this kind" (which means a "3S detachable gondola" if you want to be pedantic). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be honest, we needed a big span to get across the valley anyway, and when you have a span of 2,800m, you may as well add another 200m and get the world record," said Stefan Huter, project engineer for Doppelmayr, the Austrian company that carried out the project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got a sneak preview of the new lift, and it is undeniably impressive. Each of the 28 gondolas carries up to 28 people, taking 11 minutes to cross the Fitzsimmons Creek valley. Most people might feel a twinge of vertigo as they hover 436m in the air, but just to make sure, two of the gondolas have a glass section in the floor. The views, from Fissile Peak in one direction, and back to Whistler resort and Rainbow Peak in the other, are stunning, and in summer hikers using the lift will have the chance of spotting black bear among the Douglas Firs below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers are proud of the fact that having so few pylons, with big gaps in between, keeps the lift's "footprint" to a minimum, and that because it travels horizontally across the valley rather than descending to the creek bed then climbing up the other side, it uses no more energy than a conventional chairlift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting there&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Robbins traveled with Inghams (+44 (0)20 8780 4447; &lt;a href="http://www.inghams.co.uk"&gt;inghams.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) which offers a week at the five-star Fairmont Chateau Whistler from £829 room only, including flights and transfers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• For more on Europe's epic start to the ski season, read Tom Robbins's report from Verbier in Sunday's Escape section, in The Observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/skiing"&gt;Skiing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/snowboarding"&gt;Snowboarding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

Even as our governments claim they want to drag the world into an effective climate agreement in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/poznan"&gt;Poznan&lt;/a&gt;, they have just pulled Europe out of one in Brussels. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/12/eerope-carbon-emissions-climate-change"&gt;agreement&lt;/a&gt; they have just reached is a disaster. The 20% carbon cut they promise by 2020 falls miles short of what's needed, and they'll be able to buy most of it from abroad anyway. All this means, in a world which has to eliminate most of its carbon pollution, is that other countries, which have sold their easiest reductions to us, will then find it harder to make emissions cuts of their own. It's carbon colonialism, in which Europe picks the low-hanging fruit in developing countries, leaving them with much tougher choices later on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;European governments have also junked their commitment to turn the &lt;a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/climatechange/trading/"&gt;Emissions Trading Scheme&lt;/a&gt; into a fair and effective way of cutting pollution. At the moment over 90% of the licences to produce CO2 are given away to the biggest polluters. Some of these companies have made billions by passing on the nominal costs of the licences to their customers, even though they didn't have to pay anything themselves. It's a perfect inversion of environmental justice: under the ETS, the polluter gets paid. Those who have produced the most pollution get the biggest rewards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The EU promised that by 2020 all emissions permits would be sold at auction to the polluting industries. Now the heads of government have broken that promise: in 2020, big industrial polluters will have to pay for only 70% of the harm they do. Worse, companies will receive all their allowances for nothing if they can show that they're threatened by competition from firms outside the EU. As it's hard to think of any European sector which doesn't have competitors abroad, this concession appears to sink the sale of permits to industrial polluters altogether. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who has pushed hardest for these exemptions? The great green German chancellor Angela Merkel. The British government's environmental policies are wildly contradictory, but they look almost coherent by comparison to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/12/merkel-germany-european-union-summit"&gt;Germany's&lt;/a&gt;. In some respects it's the most progressive country in the EU, with a federal scheme to insulate the entire housing stock and an investment in wind power which puts the UK (with far greater wind resources) to shame. In other respects it has become the dirty man of Europe. It was Merkel who demanded weaker standards for fuel efficiency in cars, Merkel who pushed hardest for a €40bn bail-out of the motor manufacturers, Merkel who now insists that the big cement, steel and chemicals companies are allowed to get away without paying.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can these contradictions be explained? Rather like our own government, Merkel's administration is prepared to support only those measures which don't hurt big business. It pours billions of euros into useless schemes which generate corporate revenue (such as the half million solar roofs it has paid for so far, which contribute a grand total of 0.4% of Germany's electricity supply) and opposes effective schemes which would clobber carbon emissions but hurt corporate profits. The German government is prepared to go green only when it costs corporations nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, Mrs Merkel. With the help of Donald Tusk, Silvio Berlusconi and one or two other Neanderthals, you have now messed it up for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/greenpolitics"&gt;Green politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/poznan"&gt;Poznan climate change conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Stress and lack of exercise are killing elephants, zoos warned</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/dec/12/elephants-animal-welfare</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/12546?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Science%3A+Stress+and+lack+of+exercise+are+killing+elephants%2C+zoos+warned&amp;ch=Science&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Animal+behaviour+%28Science%29%2CZoology%2CAnimal+welfare%2CUK+news%2CScience&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Ian+Sample%2C+science+correspondent&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1132885&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Science&amp;c12=Animal+behaviour&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FScience%2FAnimal+behaviour" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal welfare officers yesterday urged zoos to phase out keeping elephants, after two damning reports found the animals suffer serious health problems and die much younger in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elephants born and raised in zoos live less than half as long as those living in their native Africa and Asia, despite being protected from predators and having better care, according to one of the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the deaths are thought to be linked to obesity, because the animals are well fed but get very little exercise in their small enclosures. Scientists also blamed high stress levels, which the animals suffer most after being transferred between zoos and being separated from their mothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists called on zoos to introduce immediate health checks on elephants to identify obese and stressed animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, researchers led by Ros Clubb, a wildlife scientific officer at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, analysed records of 786 Asian and African female elephants kept in European zoos between 1960 and 2005. They then compared the lifespans of the captive animals with Asian elephants used by a logging company in Burma, and African elephants living in the Amboseli national park in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian elephants born in captivity typically lived for 18.9 years, while those used as working animals in Burma survived for 41.7 years. African elephants also fared worse, living for 16.9 years in captivity and 35.9 years in the wild. When the scientists discounted African elephants killed by people in the national park, the typical lifespan reached 56 years, more than three times as long as those kept in zoos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You would expect captive elephants to live at least as long, if not longer, than those in the wild because they are better cared for, but that is not the case. The difference is massive," said Clubb, whose study appears in the US journal Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second report, commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, examined the welfare of 77 elephants in 13 UK zoos. It found that the animals spent 83% of their time indoors and 71 were overweight. Only 11 were able to walk normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We often hear that zoos play a vital role in conserving elephants but patently this is not the case," said Rob Atkinson, head of wildlife science at the RSPCA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new data shows elephants die young in Europe's zoos, and those Asian elephants born in captivity have a poor chance of survival. Surely the way forward is to encourage conservation programmes in native habitats rather than condemn elephants to a shortened and unhealthy existence in our zoos."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "Elephants are having a torrid time in our zoos, judging by this overwhelming evidence, and action must be taken to alleviate their welfare problems as a matter of urgency." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoo enclosures for elephants are typically 60 to 100 times smaller than the smallest wild territories. African elephants can roam over 2,000 square miles, and Asian elephants 300 square miles. In captivity, researchers said, elephants are also at risk from infanticide, tuberculosis, herpes and lameness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/animalbehaviour"&gt;Animal behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/zoology"&gt;Zoology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/animalwelfare"&gt;Animal welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Where are all the environmental online videos?</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/dec/12/climate-change-youtube-videos</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/58578?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Environment%3A+Watch+this%2C+or+the+planet+gets+it%21&amp;ch=Environment&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Environment%2CActivists+%28Environment%29%2CClimate+change+%28Environment%29&amp;c5=Climate+Change%2CEthical+Living&amp;c6=Leo+Hickman&amp;c7=2008_12_12&amp;c8=1133102&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Environment&amp;c12=Activists&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FEnvironment%2FActivists" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When was the last time a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; video focused on an environment issue went truly viral?  Probably about a year ago when &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/education/2004083774_terrifyingvideo20m.html"&gt;Greg Craven&lt;/a&gt;'s nine-minute lecture entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zORv8wwiadQ&amp;feature=channel"&gt;The Most Terrifying Video You'll Ever See&lt;/a&gt;" wracked up several millions views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But such examples are pretty rare amid all the music videos, krazy dance routines and funny animal clips that usually hog YouTube's Most Viewed charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accurate reflection of what grabs the attention of the internet generation? Yes, but it does seem a little odd that amid all the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/09/climate-change-science-environment"&gt;current talk&lt;/a&gt; on how best to engage a largely apathetic public about our multitude of environmental problems then more people haven't tried to come up with other Craven-esque methods of spreading the message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking people to read their way their the &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/"&gt;IPCC&lt;/a&gt; reports doesn't seem to be doing the trick, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animation seems to be a popular technique for creating environmental videos online. &lt;a href="http://www.planestupid.com/"&gt;Plane Stupid&lt;/a&gt;'s Leo Murray recently created &lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1709110?pg=embed&amp;sec=1709110"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; as part of his MA in animation at the Royal College of Art, but it has yet to go viral beyond environmental circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a multitude of other environmental animations on the net, but none seem to have broken out and become a mainstream hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTV-style videos that are light on the message and high on style seem to be another technique that has had some success. For example, the &lt;a href="http://www.blueman.com/"&gt;Blue Man Group&lt;/a&gt; produced this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM-mfEMssy8"&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt; about global warming a couple of years ago and it has achieved more than two million views to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This video called &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FVZSUsT-Ws"&gt;Global Warming: A Point of No Return&lt;/a&gt; has had more than 300,000 views, but it's not my cup of tea at all. I think in our cynical times over-emoting like this risks putting more people off than winning them over. Also, the music, especially in the second half, is truly awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what have you seen out there that should be seen by others? And, more importantly, can YouTube-style videos ever be an effective medium for stoking passion about these issues?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/activists"&gt;Activists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climatechange"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;
