It establishes the research-based foundation for how to get an innovation - a new product, service or idea - diffused through, and adopted by, a social system. It is the origin book for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; marketing guidebooks ("&lt;em&gt;The 7,8,9 Steps for Achieving Market Nirvana"&lt;/em&gt;...) and is the source for identifying "adoptor" categories and the adoption life cycle process - think chasm crossing as an example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diffusion of Innovations&lt;/em&gt; puts forth that market segments are integrated social systems and the process of understanding their structures, behaviors and adopter-influencer pyches is the critical foundation step to devising a cogent business and marketing strategy. Meaning, you can want to "push" an innovation into a market but unless you understand that market's complexities and nuances you are vunerable to its whims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, marketing always starts here - right back where I began.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

To navigate around, and decide what you want to read, each Alltop site displays the headlines of the latest stories from dozens of sites and blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alltop positions itself as a “digital magazine rack” of the Internet - but Alltop links are content starting points, not the end game. Nonetheless, Alltop is wonderful way to transform online reading - you now can easily find stories from both your favorite frequented sites and sites that were previously lurking in Internet worm holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look at how Dan Roam, author of &lt;em&gt;Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems with Pictures&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://alltop.com/about/nuggets.php"&gt;visually&lt;/a&gt; describes the difference between Alltop and Google.

His message is one of personal re-focus, in that studies show that the vast majority of people don't use their strengths the majority of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His perspective revolves around the principle that your strengths are the single most important driver of performance. And, that the difference between great teams/companies, and not so great teams/companies, is the ability for people to use their strengths daily. Yet, we live in a world fascinated by what we don't have, what we don't do well, what we think we need to improve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help shift this somewhat universal mindset and help people put their strengths to work, he shared these macro "myths":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Myth #1:&lt;/strong&gt; As you grow, your personality changes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Truth:&lt;/strong&gt; As you grow, you become more and more of who you already are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Myth #2:&lt;/strong&gt; You grow the most in your areas of weakness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Truth: &lt;/strong&gt;You grow the most in your areas of greatest strength&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Myth #3:&lt;/strong&gt; A great team member puts his strengths aside and does whatever it takes to help the team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Truth:&lt;/strong&gt; A great team member volunteers his strengths to the team most of the time&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

Here is a quick summary of its key findings and themes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Meaning: &lt;/strong&gt; What matters to you is what motivates you. So, contributing to a "bigger" and meaningful purpose (as you define it) is how you'll fuel your career path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Managing Energy&lt;/strong&gt;: The report suggests that work-life balance is a "myth" despite the best efforts of corporate HR. The facts simply speak for themselves - senior executives work a lot of hours. The best advice then is, focus on priorities that energize you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Positive Framing&lt;/strong&gt;: Optimists actually view life through realistic lens, and that awareness leads them to acknowledge the truth of situations and act quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Connecting&lt;/strong&gt;: Bottom line, those with developed networks and committed mentors reap the benefits with a strong career path. Interestingly enough, because men have broader/shallower networks they attract more opportunities than women who have deeper/narrower networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Engaging:&lt;/strong&gt; Women need to step into the flow more; speak up and promote themselves. Those that take more risks, and elevate their profiles, will absolutely reap greater professional rewards.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

Invoking 64 steps to follow, he lays out a broad road map for visualizing and actualizing a successful life - albeit from a more monetary versus holistic perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canfield's background suggests that his success perscription has worked for him: From a teacher scraping by to make do to a multimillion dollar, best-selling book author/guru he has truly walked down his own transformation path. If the success of his &lt;em&gt;Chicken Soup &lt;/em&gt;series is any indicator, his new book has mined a winning formula that the masses will want to consume. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His philosophy is straightforward, and manner engaging, and is summed up by the view that success is not delegatable to anyone else but yourself. Here are some of his fundamental dictates:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Take 100% responsibility &lt;/strong&gt;- give up justifying, defending, and excuse making&lt;br /&gt;2. Decide what you want - have a &lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt; - and eliminate the phrase "I can't"&lt;br /&gt;3. Set measurable goals - and &lt;strong&gt;think of goals beyond yourself&lt;/strong&gt;, and envision them as already complete&lt;br /&gt;4. Think positive thoughts and visualize - &lt;strong&gt;thought is energy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5. Give up blaming - &lt;strong&gt;complaining puts you in a powerless position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Take action &lt;/strong&gt;- and establish new habits&lt;br /&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Adopt beliefs that empower you &lt;/strong&gt;- your perceptions are limited by your beliefs &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the no excuses comment category, Canfield asserts that the people who don't have goals end up working for those that do. (Ouch.) To start off, you have to determine if what you are only tolerating outweighs those things that truly contribute positively to your life. If this scale is unbalanced, start the process, embrace the principles, and start to rewire your brain. Success will follow.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

In a world where progress and success is often rewarded regardless of how it was achieved, &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; makes a compelling argument for rethinking this strategy and reviewing the set of values by which we live. Friedman's point is that the world wouldn't be in the financial mess that it's in if we focused more on how we live/work than what we want out of life/work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; makes the case that in today's world where information is immediately accessible on just about everything and much of what is produced in terms of products and services (the whats) have been commoditized, &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; you behave-act-live-work is where the real game of differentiation and value needs to be played. Also, when everyone can see "what" you do, they can infer "how" you are making decisions and the values you uphold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think Sarah Palin and her $150K accessories budget for a campaign wardrobe upgrade - how does that make her look to "everyday" folks struggling with their food and gas budgets? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seidman makes a cogent case that the age of transparency is right here/right now and that success in life is more based on behavior - or in the case of business, of outbehaving the competition. Characteristics such as integrity, passion, humility, and trust are the true cornerstones of personal or business success and living according to these tenants is what your customers, partners, colleagues, employees and investors (and friends) can count on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; represents a new currency for business, and not necessarily an easy one to calculate if you've lived according to a different set of rules. But in a wired world, a sterling reputation is your greatest asset and it is a well of capital from which you can draw. Mismanaging that reputation and not thinking about "how" you are living/behaving can have grave and lasting impact.

It's clear that recent government-sponsored rescue plans have not had the impact wanted, or anticipated, leading to damaging spill-over across some global markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their economists see the ongoing credit crunch resulting in: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some &lt;strong&gt;Q3 '08 negative growth for U.S. gross domestic product &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Further &lt;strong&gt;recessionary signals in Q4 '08 &lt;/strong&gt;and advancing contraction into the first half of 2009. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;No housing market uptick before the first half of 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;at the earliest, plus possible further drops in housing prices &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Near-term credit channels locking up&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e.commercial paper) - putting a huge load on conducting daily business across the board&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their expectation is that inter-bank lending will resume, building a step-by-step upswing in overall business and investing confidence - given that the government measures create the planned effect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: All hands from the private and government sector need to stay heads-down and work these measures through the system and, simultaneously, do their best to minimize public exposure to the messy, depressing inner workings that by definition must go on. Public confidence is absolutely a core component to switching the downward financial course - and the growing global tidal wave of fear must be rechanneled.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

But rather it is a generation that because of its digital origins thinks differently; is scoring higher on SATs; graduating more from college (and creating more college drop-outs); volunteering at an all-time high; changing family organizational models; and engendering the rise of truly collaborative communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the Net Generation have a whole new set of "how to live" expectations that include:(1) Freedom; (2) Customization; (3) Scrutiny; (4) Integrity; (5) Collaboration; (6) Entertainment; (7) Speed; and (8) Innovation. One of the most important findings was that 62% say that having fun while engaged in some product/service is as important as what a product does. And they extend that value to the workplace - have fun, or they'll leave. Moving in and out of jobs at an amazingly rapid, sequential rate.(Side note: Perhaps without truly understanding the new economy that we are facing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For them the marketing "P"s have also changed. Instead of product, it's about consumer experience. For place, it's any place, any marketspace, anywhere. In determining their price thresholds, they are interested in discovering true value before buying. And they are not grabbed by promotions, but rather engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The net for all of us marketers (and in fact all business people): Brands need to be relational in every aspect for those who have now grown up digital.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

Whereas conventional wisdom used to say that the best management team will beat the best strategy, the randomness of success or failure no longer guarantees this outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now only relentless performance improvement can avoid the gravitational pull of regression to the mean, but traditional performance improvement methods need to yield to the new discipline of "progressive improvements" that embraces the complexity of preformance through directed adaptation. True gains now depend on compounding the effects of small improvements to achieve large gains - and doing so by decomposing a long journey into holistic steps and engineering learning in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a business, achieving compound effects requires incorporating and adhering to: (1) shared infrastructure; (2) regulations that impose boundaries; (3) reviews that enforce compliance and accomodate exceptions; and (4) local initiatives guided by market forces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, the strategy process must be paced by the market and not the planning cycle - because as risk increases, planning must adjust to uncertainty. In short, companies must shorten the planning-doing cycle and move to a new strategy development construct that focuses on shorter time frames and more rapid outcomes. Here's his new way of framing how to drive strategy, and hence progressive perforamnce improvements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. In the old world, we all started with research and SWOT analyses. Now, simply state your Case for Action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Instead of a strategy articulation that was a full blueprint for getting from point A to Z, now compose a vision (a sketch) that is the design strategy ideal (and not complete roadmap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Eliminate the detailed plan and instead devise a campaign that is a portfolio of initiatives that can be tested, embraced, or ditched.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

The lessons: Learn to expand your horizons, see what's coming, develop key indicators, and conjure up a sense of possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;People are the Issue&lt;/strong&gt;: At the heart of every challenge a technology leader faces, the technology is always trumped by people. Real technology leadership mastery will come from embracing the sociological equation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Experience is the New Center&lt;/strong&gt;: The shift has happened. We have moved away from thinking about technology in terms of the coolness of the devices, to the rightness of the experience. This transcendence of experience centricity requires leaders to think less of product-service functionality and more about creating innovations in customer experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;The Conundrum of Big Change and Stubborn Stability&lt;/strong&gt;: Everything, everything is moving so fast - elevating the value of speed, scalability and rapid decision-making. Conversely, no matter how hard you try, some things stubbornly will not inch forward an iota. Finding balance here, and working within this paradoxical construct, will be the new business zen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Unmanageable Practices, Disciplined&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone is hungry for ways to wrestle down unmanageable processes - look at the huge success of six sigma, statistical process controls, and supply chain management. We're just beginning to see how software development and business experimentation can become more of a 'science' than art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;The Limits of Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Controls are stretching beyond control with the adoption of so many consumer technology innovations and digital mobile work - and even individuals empowering themselves in the face of corporate control mandates. Controls? Think again, and think radically differently about risk, security, responsibility, and individualism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Simplicity Trumps All&lt;/strong&gt;: Bottom line, the answer to all questions is elegant simplicity will win - no matter what technology, design, process is behind a solution. So, all competitive landscape bets are off, because going forward simple pratical solutions will prevail over what's harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Fun and Learning-The New Work:&lt;/strong&gt; Hard to imagine for a certain generation and for those of a certain mindset, but fun and learning are the new workplace absolutes for business success. Understand it, embrace it, live it - or lose consumers, customers, and a whole generation of workers who won't work for you without it.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

The path to shifting your orientation begins with simply being present with "Now," although the path to living fully in the present is not necessarily a fast or slow one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if an event or series of events impresses on you that all external forms are transitory - say a tragedy or sudden major life change - then you shift more radically and step back from over placing importance on forms. I know this to be true in my life when our daughter had a life-threatening situation seven years ago; my total external orientation shifted. Work and my career took second place; our new home that we had just built was no longer very important; the pursuit of all various external forms simply lost their ascendant value in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that I still don't care about my outer life, and that I don't believe in being the best I can be. I just don't attach like I did to external forms and measures, and from the moments where our daughter's life was in danger, I knew I never would. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result for me has been a new freedom from what others think, and how they measure me against themselves or some externally defined "measuring stick." These measure don't have any real meaning for me, although I may have to co-exist with them. I care most about my family, my home, and doing good work every day. In the process, I have been happier and more fulfilled than ever before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost losing our daughter immeasurably contributed to a much better life for me, and my family. Work and my career have benefited as well. And all because my values are much more fully intrinsically aligned.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

Based on a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the first time in the post-modern, post-feminist era, an economic recovery has come (and gone) and there are fewer women in the workforce than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the seven recoveries prior, more women re-entered the workforce post recovery - but not this last time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first tracked, the analysis was the "women were staying home to raise their children" - another assumption that really should raise the hackles of every sentient women. However, data irrefutably proves that women across the board and from the executive suite to the factory floor went home and are staying home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citing downturns, pay cuts, stagnate wages, lay-offs, and a whole plethora of dismal causes, women are just stepping out as opposed to dropping down the "scale" - perhaps fearing that once they step down they are going to have an impossibly hard time getting back to where they were, let alone to where they legitimately aspired to climb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts are the facts: Median pay is falling from $15.04 in 2004 for women to $14.84 for women, adjusted for inflation. Those that didn't go to college are scaling back, and getting that degree now. Those that have any safety net are in those nets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a positive outcome for anyone - women or men. But women need to take notice for themselves and their daughters. It's not time to step back because it is gut wrenchingly hard open those doors again. Many of us went through this during the last downturn, and the best (although hardest) thing to do is stay in the game.

I am the content director for the CEO Summit, and we were considering the hottest, and newest, books that provide insights into the global issues CEOs are most concerned about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the last thing I expected to add to this list was a book like &lt;em&gt;The New Earth &lt;/em&gt;- not that I don't read books like this because I do all the time. I just didn't think my company would want to stray outside the normal boundaries of business concerns. However, our executive sponsor (via his wife) had heard raves about &lt;em&gt;The New Earth &lt;/em&gt;and hence we included it in our "book gift package."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my responsibilities/time commitments directing content at the Summit, I didn't have a chance myself to crack open the book until I was on my annual Kauai vacation a couple of weeks later - and in fact, on the flight back home to Seattle. (OK, I said, let's see what this book is all about. I'm rested; have swum to my heart's content; have just been in my family world without work interference for a couple for weeks...I'm ready for something new.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't normally find that a spiritual book can hold my attention while flying, so I knew I was running a risk cracking open &lt;em&gt;The New Earth&lt;/em&gt;. (As a precautionary measure, I had my back-up books all ready in my canvas bag!) But once I started reading, I was riveted in a completely different way that I normally am. I felt that I was being spoken to, and called on, to do something beyond what I had been doing with my life - and I really needed to pay attention to what this book was trying to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've spent a whole lot of time thinking (and talking) about "what is my life's purpose" - and often have felt extremely frustrated that I wasn't achieving great clarity with what is surely the most important question I can answer in the 80 or so years (I hope) I'll have on this planet. But instead, I think I should be asking the question: "What does life (or God) want from me? What is my place in terms of the greater scheme of things, not in terms of 'me.'"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This question is big, and seemingly impossible to answer according to our normal paradigms of consciousness. You just can't get there from where most of us are. So &lt;em&gt;The New Earth &lt;/em&gt;starts with the first baby (and giant) step we need to take to awaken to the larger purpose - and that is to access the stillness within ourselves. We need to step out of our interfering thinking minds and be open to the broader dimensions and possibilities of inner stillness - and what arises from a place of utter quiet within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the first action Eckart Tolle suggests we embrace is to step into nature and perceive natural phenomena against the background of stillness - such as to look at a flower and simply experience it and not try to name it or describe it but just be with it. In stepping away from the voice that plays in all of our heads, we can start to "see" in new and more vital ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many concepts in this book, the step into stillness is powerfully captivating and simultaneously elusive. Which is why I am reading the book again. What's interesting is that when I went on &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com"&gt;www.oprah.com &lt;/a&gt;to watch Oprah's and Eckart's first global webcast (10 week program) on the book, I read in the "exercise workbook" section that the best way to assimilate &lt;em&gt;The New Earth's &lt;/em&gt;messages was to read, and re-read the text. "As you read, a shift takes place" within the reader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reader, and awakening spiritual student, I can only say that this direction has resonated strongly and positively within me.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

After receiving unprecedented response, he followed-up the article by publishing a book titled after the article's thesis - &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book's thesis is derived from Professor Sutton's academic group, where one of his colleagues clearly articulated what was to become a defacto policy, "Listen, I don't care if that guy won the Nobel Prize...I just don't want any asshole ruining our group." From that day on, his academic circle held all potential faculty hires to what they termed their "no asshole rule."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although on the surface the subject seems inflammatory, especially if you hold to a careful, corporate mindset, this treatise is really an object lesson about something incredibly important to anyone who co-exists with others - whether in business, academics, government, science, medicine, entertainment or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Sutton's research clearly reveals that accepting, tolerating, enduring or "living with" a bully, jerk, control freak, asshole (you choose the descriptor) negatively impacts physical and mental health.  What's even scarier is that when someone submits or accepts to being around these negative people, beyond a short period of time, they become increasingly like them. I call this the "clone bully evolutionary process." It's just easy to see how a culture with top leaders that lead by intimidation, control, or fear, create an overall negative environment that mirrors them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Sutton offers two tests for categorizing this unappealing type of person. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Test&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; one is if the "target feels oppressed, humiliated, de-engerized, or belittled by the person; if the target feels worse about him or herself" as a result of the interaction. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Test two&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is if the "alleged asshole aims his or her venom at people who are less powerful than at those people who are more powerful." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that Dr. Sutton doesn't support the importance of productive confrontation and competition. But when it all comes down to it, he says to listen to the language - the healthiest, and eventually most productive, organizational environments more often say "we," "partner," and "team," than "I" and "me."&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

HBR's "Putting Leadership Back Into Strategy" contends that strategy has become a left-brained exercise dominated by systems, frameworks, numbers, up-down arrows, scorecards, and a full plethora of tools. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This profound amount of analytical ammunition dominates how the C-suite integrates strategy into business processes. As a result, strategy is now seen more as a type of plan or idea derived and driven by quantitative parameters. The consequence of this shift is that "what we have lost sight of is that strategy is a way of life for a company. Strategy defines what a firm will be."  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what's truly been lost by this pendulum swing is the importance of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to strategy. In defining purpose, we need to ask why does a company even exist? What is the organization committed to accomplishing in the broadest sense? How should employees focus their efforts? And, why should any employee intrinsically care about their work beyond their normal financial compensation and corporate benefits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth, "purpose should be at the heart of strategy." Purpose directs the course of a company, sets guidelines for all behaviors, and motivates employee contributions to the corporate effort beyond strict quid pro quo. In all simplicity, defining purpose answers why any employee, customer, partner or market observer should care about your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, acknowledging the value of purpose is difficult today given how much the world has come to rely on analytically-based strategies. The topic seems "cosmic" (one definition I've heard), and the process of articulating a corporate purpose requires deep inner thinking and creative interpersonal interactions.  However, marshalling one's resources and determing an actionable corporate "purpose" is, in fact, the true task of today's CEO to give meaning and direction to his or her business.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

"Love and Fear and the Modern Boss" examines Niccolo Machiavelli's' 500 year-old premise that if a leader can't be &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; loved and feared that they are more effective being feared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the article suggests that there are business environments that for security or safety purposes (think nuclear plants and heavy equipment manufacturing facilities) where fear-based leadership still needs to reign, I wonder what that thesis says about the workers employed in these situations. That people can't make good everyday or significant decisions without feeling the fear of immediate respirals? Don't they have inherent concern about safety or security that guides their behavior?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I don't believe in leadership by fear or intimidation in any business, social, political or community circumstance. Fear, or power-based based leadership is the path of least resistance for leaders; it gives them an easy "out" to avoid coming up with positive, forward-thinking approaches for communicating with, motivating and rewarding team members as equal human beings. It's lazy and destructive, and should never be "in style."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If team members have to continuously deal with leaders that impose direction vis-a-vis fear/bully-based styles and methods, then they'll stop thinking for themselves and only focus on responding to demands and edicts.

What really stands out in his book is how HARD Martin worked - getting gigs, refining his no-punch-line comedic craft, and traveling/performing incessantly for journeyman-like pay. He became a consummate professional by sheer endurance more than any particular raw talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His big moment almost didn't happen and it took the confluence of timing, constant second-tier exposure, and the emergence of SNL to propel him into a whole new category of comedic success. But when he stepped into the big bright lights Martin knew that his moment may be short and that he needed to maximize his pay day. So, the crowds grew bigger and bigger - defying any previous norm about audiences paying to see comedians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the crowds and his huge, unbelievable popularity were the things that put an abrupt and final end to his stand-up career. People expected to see Steve Martin - that wild and crazy guy - King Tutting his way through his performances. These incessant expectations left no room for the discovery and practice of new (potentially equally crazy) ideas which were the hallmark and foundation of his comedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, he quit stand-up permanently one night and never looked back - until now. I'm glad he did turn his gaze backward and share with us this ordinary story of someone who became an extraordinary performer. Thanks Steve.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

A specialist in business creativity, much of Annette's work revolves around how to cultivate and inspire the creative thinking strategies necessary for succeeding in today's business world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her framework circles around the concept of "Five Faces of Genius," which are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Seer - The Power to Image&lt;/span&gt;. Seers can conceptualize ideas, concepts, directions as "pictures in the mind's eye" and thus can imagine and see unexplored possibilities. Their key creative skill is visualization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Observer - The Power to Notice Detail&lt;/span&gt;. Observers pay attention to all the information and data that they encounter and through their analysis of this information form new ideas. Their key creative skill is the incessant collecting of detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;*The Alchemist - The Power to Connect Domains&lt;/span&gt;. Alchemists take different systems of thought, domains and disciplines and shuffle information from them together to form a brand new set of ideas. Their key creative skill is that ideas come from previously unconnected connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Fool: The Power to Celebrate Weakness.&lt;/span&gt; According to Annette, the Fool is the most complex face in that it celebrates weakness, turns ideas upside down, and demonstrates extraordinary perseverance. Their key creative skills are the ability to embrace absurdity and staying the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Sage: The Power to Simplify.&lt;/span&gt; Sages distill information down to its core and in doing so hit upon a new way of looking at that information. Lots of information is key to this process, however, and they look to the past for clarifying insights. Their key creative skill is simplification and seeing that ideas coming from history and story.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

The answer: Focus on a single global brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In examining the challenges that Ford faces in having created specialized products for different countries, under various brands, author John Quelch concludes that Ford's multi-brand strategy has resulted in "added manufacturing and supply chain costs, a balkanized bureaucracy, and deteriorating market share, financial performance, and stock price." In short, Ford's brand value has declined significantly while companies like Toyota, Nissan, and Honda have built brand value by selling standard products under a single brand umbrella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the result today is that Toyota is one of the top 10 most valuable global brands and Ford, once on that prestigious list, is no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be a top global brand, here are the five characteristics Quelch posits are needed - with my added commentary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Same Worldwide Positioning:&lt;/span&gt; When you start making notable changes to how you position a product based on some sort market segmentation, you lose the power of having one consistent message and run the risk of message dilution and market confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;A Focus on a Single Product Category:&lt;/span&gt; Even if it is a broad way to categorize your positioning, zero in on one category for any product brand. Although Quelch says this is the best company strategy, and certainly it has worked with companies like Intel, I think you can successfully be in several product brand categories if a company has a clear and unifying corporate brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Company Name is the Brand Name:&lt;/span&gt; It's the best bang for your buck, for sure, and companies like IBM have leveraged this strategy very successfully. However, my opinion that even the best of brands (think Microsoft) can have great sub-brands (think Xbox), and often have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Access to the Global Village:&lt;/span&gt; Quelch says the "consuming the brand equals membership in a global club. Think IBM's solutions for a small planet." I agree that infusing the brand with some sort of broad, global meaning is necessary to maintain power brand status and insure that customers/clients keep wanting to associate with your brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt; Social Responsibility:&lt;/span&gt; It's not enough to grow, drive profits, create shareholder value, and deliver superior solutions; the marketplace expect leaders to lead in areas of social need. So, companies have to determine how to focus authentically on a particular social cause that makes sense in the context of the company and its operations - and deliver tangible results.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

It's an internal orientation shift that certainly implies a new way of thinking about business strategies, operationalizing the business, and motivating corporate employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steady and sustained top-line growth is their second area of greatest concern, with keeping top management aligned to execution of strategy in the third, profit growth the fourth, and finding qualified managerial talent in the fifth positions of concern, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People management, in short, is back in the spotlight replacing U.S. healthcare costs as the top HR issue as CEOs "become increasingly aware of the crucial role that people play in growing their companies." But U.S. CEOs still rank healthcare significantly higher as a concern than global counterparts, placing it as their 16th issue vs. European CEOs ranking it the 71st and Asian CEOs the 69th position, respectively.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

The Accidental Influential:&lt;/span&gt; Duncan Watt's academic research turns upside down Malcom Gladwell's theory in &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The Tipping Point &lt;/span&gt;that the rapid spreading and acceptance of big trends, "social epidemics," are triggered by a small subset of highly influential individuals in a particular social environment. Influentials are described as a smallish, select group of people who supposedly have "influential" impact (influence) on various market subsegments (people) - thereby negating the need to market to everyone in these market subsegments, but rather to a few key influencers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watt's research instead shows that the key requirement for what his calls "global cascades" - the broad propagation of an concept through networks - occurs via a critical mass of "easily influenced people." Via this theory adoption and buying trends are not led by a few influentials, but rather though many easily influenced individuals. So, we can see why today's popular social media vehicles (MySpace, Facebook, YouTube) are the real catalysts and drivers today for the adoption of new ideas, concepts and products/services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;2. Brand Magic:&lt;/span&gt; In brand marketing theory it goes without saying that a brand strategy matches up with a market segment - an audience category defined by its primary and differentiating characteristics such as age, interests, education, and socioeconomic status. As an example take a look at the range of cosmetic brands, by the same parent company, targeted at different age groups. To follow traditional brand principles, the brand parent graduates their customers to new brands once customers "move beyond" a certain age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this approach can discourage customer loyalty, cause indiscriminate brand jumping, and is the root source of significant overspending in product development and marketing. Instead, a brand parent should build and evolve a brand along with its customers' natural developmental processes, and adapt the brand as their customer base grows older, has (or doesn't have) kids, and moves forward in life. They call this form of brand strategy "Harry Potter marketing" - a branding concept that grows up with you like this fictional character did with its reading population.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

These employees also have the strong relationships with customers and build affinities with them, while believing their company can be classified as "outstanding" in their customer service. 26% of respondents have this type of supervisor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Caring Mentors&lt;/span&gt;" excel in relationship management and receive high appreciation marks from their direct reports. They rate high on being knowledgeable about relevant subject matter and demonstrate constancy and steadiness in their everyday business dealings. They are not seen as been particularly task driven, nor are they described as controlling, tough or ruthless. Bottom line, employees serving under this manager are the most likely to stay with a company long-term, as well as recommend the company to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, the least effective supervisor type is best described as tough, controlling, ruthless and Machiavellian. Maritz has named these inconsistent, untrustworthy and dishonest supervisors as "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Win-At-Any-Cost&lt;/span&gt;" and 19% of respondents have this type of supervisor. Employees do not respect these bosses and employee engagement is the lowest among this group. In fact, 71% of employees would fire their supervisor in this category if they could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Taskmaster/Taskmistress&lt;/span&gt;" category, with supervisors that are tough, controlling and task-driven but who exhibit a higher level of competency and ethics than "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Win-At-Any-Cost&lt;/span&gt;" supervisors. Their focus is on productivity and achieving results but they are not rated as being highly effective or having/inspiring high customer service competencies. 10% of respondents have bosses that are in this category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The largest percentage of respondents (29%) work for the "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Respectable Professional&lt;/span&gt;" - a highly task-driven boss that is not greatly involved with business operations but is regarded with respect by their employees.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.

But take note, there are some surprises in the job segments that are projected to experience slower than average growth, that being under 13%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect computer programming jobs to decrease by 2% between 2004-2014 due to the profound shift towards outsourcing. Who would have thought of this during the go-go technology years? So, if you want to stick with coding, refocus your professional energies on hot specialties such as security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalism opportunities will also go into a nose dive, despite the proliferation of rapidly expanding media outlets. This segment's dilemma is that online media will increasingly replace print and there will be a profit crunch. Jobs and overall costs will need to be slashed, forcing an internal contraction inside media organizations. In fact, journalism jobs are only anticipated to grow by 5% in the next ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't the moment to begin a career in radio either. Consolidation abounds, and the next decade will see overall job reductions in the area of 5%. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big surprise however is in area of federal jobs, with Washington employing two million people excluding the military. But, federal job growth is only expected to grow by 1.6%. Why? It looks a lot better (on paper) to move that money around and pay private contracting companies instead of federal employees to do the work. In fact, the House of Representatives reported that government contract spending rose by 103% between 2000 and 20005. Amazing.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Marketfusions.
