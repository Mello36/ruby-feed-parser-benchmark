			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p class="MsoNormal">Profit is a need, not a purpose. Even if it ensures business survival, profit is the result of successful business connections, thus, a measure of the relationship between you and you clients. According to Peter Druker, there is but one valid definition of the purpose of a company: creating clients. Each company creates its client, and I’ll go as far as saying it has a certain amount of control over them. So next time you wonder why a client is not ‘good’, take a close look at how you’ve created that client and what were the errors made during the aquisition or collaboration with that specific client.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">Get a clear picture of what and to who you are selling if you wish to create a ‘good’ client, make a comprehensible definition of your ‘offer’ and differentiate from competition</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In spite of the obvious need for clients, don’t rush in on selling proximately anything to anyone. A clear definition of products/services and client segmentation (see article on client segmentation), in other words specialization, differentiate you from competition.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if gte vml 1]&amp;gt;                     &amp;lt;![endif]--><!--[if !vml]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Innovation, price, brand? In the end it’s all about identifying your competitive advantage (and sometimes validate if you have one), otherwise you’ll have too little value to stay in the business. Keep in mind that, again, clients should be your main concern, and your long-term competitive advantage should be built around their needs, their needs expressed trough the value you can bring to what they produce, not what you offer. It might sound odd, but if you look closely you’ll notice that your business is a ferrule of the chain and that positioning your business correctly is a ferrule in your client’s value chain.<img src="/DOCUME~1/ALEXAN~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/DOCUME~1/ALEXAN~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt="" /><img src="/DOCUME~1/ALEXAN~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="" /><img src="/DOCUME~1/ALEXAN~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-2.jpg" alt="" /><img src="/DOCUME~1/ALEXAN~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Find out who’s your main competition</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><sub><span style="font-size:16pt;line-height:115%;color:#c00000;"><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;"> </span></span></span></sub>Understand and define your purposes</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]-->Grow or choose your target market or major</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]-->Define you offer and value (I’ll be speaking more about value in my next post)</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">Competitive advantage built trough client relationships</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It usually takes a little research to find out if you really know what your clients’ needs are. There is a tight connection between needs and fears or risks. The bigger the level of risk the client perceives, the smaller the odd that he buys a certain product or service, and the bigger the odds that if they do buy it, they will not be satisfied. This will result in a less happy client, and it’s your responsibility to ensure that the risks are as small as possible in order to create a good client.</p>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><sub><span style="font-size:16pt;line-height:115%;color:#c00000;"><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;"> </span></span></span></sub><!--[endif]-->Build in the targeted market, trough the use of references, recommendations and positive image, a reputation of trusted company that offers a quality product/service.</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Offer guarantees, assurances, and/or post-sale support, in order to enhance your client’s level of safety.</li>
<li>Build professional relationships with clients as the root of competitive advantage and regard your business as a complex social network.</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->The reputation of preferred deliverer does not start on the outside, but form the inside, trough the development of the appropriate mentality within your organization, and only than continues with your market identity. There is a very tight connection between motivated staff and happy clients, and that is all down to value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">Meet clients’ expectations</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clients’ needs are all about excellence of product/service, and excellence not the way you look at it, but in meeting the client’s fundamental need and value chain. The more your product or service will help your client produce value, the more of a competitive advantage you’ll have.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you know what produces value for your client, what markets is he involved in and what you can do to give him more awareness in targeted markets?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:red;">To attend or not to attend an event</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because they are randomly chosen and fairly expensive, b2b events rarely produce any spectacular results. Some experts believe that they’re a real gold mine of information on competition and thir new products/services, not to mention a terrific networking opportunity. If, however, you company has, alike many, attended a trade show in your field of expertise and has come back with a bag full of business cards, but no real leads or relevant information, then you’re probably in the ‘club’ of people who view event-attending as a waste of time and money.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:red;">Turning tradeshows into a valuable opportunity</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you want trade shows to result in leads and valuable contacts, you must change your angle of view a little. Attending as an exhibitor often implies high cost and little or no positive outcome. There are better ways of promoting your company, such as e-mailing or direct mailing. The advantages of tradeshows appear when you attend as a ‘plain’ visitor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:red;">What is boothhunting</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>Exactly what the name describes. It refers to ‘hunting’ for potential clients who are there as exhibitors. If you set the goal of generating leads, you have to look for events in your client’s line of work in order to ‘hunt’ for the interesting ones. Tough the idea of trying to sell a product or service to someone who is actually there to sell something to you might seem ‘built for failure’, the method truly works.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:red;">Boot-hunting vs. exhibiting – Why ‘hunt’ at tradeshows</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-left:37.65pt;text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Booth-hunting is considerably cheaper;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:37.65pt;text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->It doesn’t take as much of your time;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:37.65pt;text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The CEO of targeted companies will be present at important events where the company exhibits, so there’s a good opportunity to meet him face to face;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-left:37.65pt;text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->You can’t approach prospects if you’re there exhibiting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:red;">How it’s done</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;color:red;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color:red;">Choosing the trade show<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The bigger the event and the more prospect companies there, the better. As a rule, it’s not worth attending a trade show if at least 20% of the companies exhibiting are not firms you’d like to work with.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;color:red;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color:red;">Planning<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">One you’ve chosen the event, you have to plan your run. There are too many things to do in too little time, so you can’t afford to ‘figure it out when you get there’., Get a list of attendees and put together your own list of ‘tradeshow attractions’.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">One you know which companies you want to approach at the event, document on them a little. You can’t appear in front of a firm you know nothing about and expect to interest the in your services. Go online and gather some basic info: CEO’s name, what are the services or products the company provides, who it provides them for, etc.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;color:red;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color:red;">At the trade show<br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Companies exhibiting are there to sell, make themselves more notorious, and will not up their time too lightly in order to listen to you. That’s why you’ll never get their attention if you start going on and on about yourself, while ‘bombarding’ everyone with company brochures. Show interest in the product/service the prospect is selling and ask lots of questions about their company, and only in the end give them your business card and say no more than one sentence about your company. In a small notebook or on the back of the business card they give you remember to take notes regarding that firm and the conversation you had. It will help you later with following-up.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Also remember not to ignore the press, which will surely be present at the trade show. Give them less of your time then you do to networking with prospects, but keep in mind that contacts in this filed are also important. Often, reporters sent on site will ask visitors for their opinion. Do not hesitate to give yours if you are asked, and maybe even start a conversation<span> </span>and exchange business cards. You never know when it’ll help, but it surely will.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:-0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;color:red;"><span>·<span> </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color:red;">Follow-up</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">This part is one of the most important steps in boothhunting if you want to be sure you didn’t just waste your time on useless small-talk. The ideal time for following-up is two weeks after the tradeshow.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Do not make the mistake of sending an e-mail containing nothing other than an impersonal greeting and an immense list of your company’s products/services. It will sound like spam and ‘move’ nobody. Give it a more personal note by addressing them directly, using their names, be short about it and use no more than one line to describe you company.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">Booth hunting is a way of interacting directly with prospect company’s CEOs that turns in very good results provided you plan ahead a little and follow some basic rules. Surely a great alternative for the less efficient and more expensive ‘plain’ exhibiting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>In over 10 years of working in an IT-related field I&#8217;ve seen major progress in company images, external and internal partnerships, even in the way companies promote themselves. A single chapter remains overlooked: the price!!!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Surprising how an aspect so important to a company&#8217;s market success - the price - is given so little attention in companies’ strategies and even in specialized literature.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A starting point&#8230;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many ways to set prices, but before we get to that, let&#8217;s see to a sensitive issue: which is the real cost? Did you evaluate it correctly and step by step? Do you keep an evidence of the costs of product development in your company? Do you know, for instance, what will be the impact of bringing a new man to the development team or of an updating of the technical infrastructure? These are sensitive subjects which you have to work on with your team in order to carefully monitor the costs at all times.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have had the occasion to see countless examples of companies complaining of lack of profitability with certain products or services, when in fact the profitability problems were related to other areas of the business. The truth was that they weren&#8217;t correctly calculating the costs for each product, service or business field, thus the profitability evaluation being erroneous.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Work with numbers is, by definition, a field that belongs to engineers, and so, surprisingly, not exactly a hobby.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>How can the price be determined?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Regardless of the way you calculate your prices (by the hour, the day, or for the project or product as a whole), once you know your costs you will be able to control them and have a effective tool on profitability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before you skip to the price, it would be useful to find out what&#8217;s the &#8220;going rate&#8221; in your line of business (see the article about benchmarking), how they form their costs and what &#8220;package&#8221; does the product come in, what are the sales fluctuations, etc. All of this vital information should one way or the other influence your own pricing strategy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You company price policy should answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span></span></span>Do you want to work at high price/rates or high quality? However tempting it might be to rush in and say quality, see what the cost for quality is, before going for it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;"></span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Which companies would you like as clients? To which ones can you sell at the target price?</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">         </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->What are the additional products or services you can sell in order to maximize the profit of an integrated solution?</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A healthy contradiction</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b> </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There&#8217;s a lot of “classical ”literature regarding pricing, so I will not insist on this in particular. But, as usual, I have a different view on price: unlike the classics I will not advice you to sell at the highest price, since I think a greater goal is to sell at the price that helps on maximizing profits.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, in order to determine the price that will maximize the profit, I always suggest that we start with the highest <b>reasonable</b> one<span style="font-family:Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span>. It&#8217;s much easier to lower the price than to try to increase it afterwards, in establishing a ling-term price strategy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>When the price works for business development</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When it comes to pricing, we should have two ground rules in mind:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many applicable pricing strategies which respond to the needs of every business, including when it comes to promotion programs. I do not recommend them! The price is a tool that must be used with caution otherwise it might turn against us. We can use such strategies when there is so much competition in line of business that pricing remains the only &#8220;fighting tool&#8221;, but even in such cases I recommend that it is used with caution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Presenting the price</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The price is presented to the client in the form of the price proposal or the company&#8217;s overall proposal. The proposal&#8217;s format and the way you present it are very sensitive aspects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The price must be easy to understand, easily perceived as a value, not a number written on paper, it must be justifiable in terms of the client&#8217;s needs and possible investments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>How do we increase the price?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most frequent issue I’ve encountered it&#8217;s not how to increase the price, but how we give the client an extra discount. In reality, the increased performance is dictated by price increasing, not cost lowering and other restrictive measures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And, most important, why do we have a problem with demanding a higher price? The main issue is value. We do not perceive or do not know exactly what the value we offer the client is. Though the understanding of the value we offer is an internal evaluation process, in a future post we will speak about different ways of increasing value. Before the next post, you might consider asking yourself: <b>how much is your product or service really worth for a client? </b></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p class="MsoNormal">This marketing tip is different from the ones about strategic planning and focuses on minor actions, which can have great impact on marketing and sales. It refers to corpoate presentations, in particular the famous slide-shows or Power Points.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The client’s boredom and endurance test</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you ask clients to tell you what they think about company presentations they’ve seen, most of them will say more or less that they’re “a necessary evil”, a complete boredom, a step they have to take in order to get to the truly relevant discussions. Most of the times, these presentations do nothing more than bore the client with stories about the wonderful accomplishments of the furnishing company, their list of projects or abilities, preferably with as many technical phrases involved, etc..</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Have you ever asked your clients what they think of your company presentation? Maybe it’s a good time to do it!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What’s the point?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, what is the purpose of a company presentation? For the sake of that presentation’s success, have you set some goals as to what do you expect to accomplish with it before actually starting to create it or before exhibiting it in front of a client? To this question, we usually get an answer like:</p>
<ul>
<li>To impress the client</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Because we have to have one</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Because everybody has one</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">In all of these justifications, where does the &#8220;point&#8221; stand out? Isn&#8217;t the <b>point</b> our need to sell and win that client? Moreover, if we have to win that client, what is the need to which he wants a solution? Did you find out about the client’s needs before making him watch 30 slides or some demo on topics that might not be of any interest to him?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The 99.99% rule</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">99.99% of company presentations are boring and 99.99% identical to their competitor’s. 99.99% information the client can obtain from other sources as well. Think this is not a scientifically proved fact? Than which was the last company presentation to impress you?… point made.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What should be in it?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The client will tell you! So find out what is it that the client wants to know about your business. What will influence him in working with you in the future, what does he know about the type of solutions you provide and if he has a real need.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In conclusion, it should contain everything connected to the client and his needs and almost nothing about how big, good, successful or interesting your business is and so on. Many clients are likely to change their minds if the image of your company you provide for them is that of an organization too big, too diverse and with too many clients. They’ll start worrying about becoming one of the many, just another line in a PPT containing 100 names is not the kind of partnership they desire. They’ll leave happy that they’ve met with a successful organization and unhappy they haven’t found a communication and business partner in you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Information on how the potential client’s market is evolving, his challenges and alternative solutions to his problems. This is the kind of information he seeks and the kind that will get his attention. Notice that it’s information regarding his company and business!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>When size and shape matter! Advice in the form of numbers…</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though the content is important, the length of it and the shape it takes are also of vital importance.</p>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>-<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->No more than 15 slides, covers included</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>-<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->No more then 3-4 ideas on each slide, with a maximum of 3-5 words used to state each of them</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>-<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->As many diagrams as possible, illustrative and well organized</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>-<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:7pt;line-height:normal;">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->No more than<span>  </span>20 minutes for the whole presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>There are even ideas and successful marketers who think you should not event have a PPT presentation but a video one, a more interactive approach&#8230; well, whatever suits your customer. Find out!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>When are company presentations not necessary?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Before rushing to hand-over a company presentation to a prospect, ask yourself: <b>is really necessary to do so?</b></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most of the times, the client has no use for it from the very beginning of your relationship, for instance to get the first meeting, but will use it as a justification for delaying an appointment or putting off a decision regarding a deal with your company. If a client asks you for a company presentation on the first encounter, without knowing you at all, it becomes clear that he wants a delay, and you’d better look into the real reasons for this request.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My advice is to never send a presentation until it’s very clear to you that your products or services deal with one of the client’s specific problems, which the client has expressed it as such and requested your presentation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do not send the presentation via e-mail unless you already know the potential client agreement, and especially if you don’t know which purpose is it going to serve. Always ask for feedback after this, requesting information that would help you improve the presentation onward. This is why “Did you like it?” is not an appropriate question in this case, but rather “Did you find it useful?” and “What useful information did you got out of it?” or “What have you learned about us from the company presentation?”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best advice: during the first meetings with the client, put the fact that you have a company presentation out of your mind. Talk about you for 5 minutes at most and find out as much as possible about your client before drowning him in information about you company!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>When are corporate presentations required?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Presentations are never indispensable… surprisingly. If the clients will be interested in your company, they’ll ask what they want to know and evaluate you as a partner according to their own ideas and standards.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why must you then still have a company presentation? Because sometimes the client asks for one, after you’ve become familiar with each other and he wants to have an “argument” to support you in his company or in front of his partners in the start of a business relationship. But even in this case my advice is to offer to meet everyone involved in the decision-taking and discover their needs and <b>don’t let your presentation speak of your client’s business! </b>If this did not made any sense <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> , let me try to give you a clue: generally do talk as least as possible about you and as much as possible about your client&#8217;s business in any communication initiatives.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">Tough the analysis of competition is important, it&#8217;s just as important to choose the examples to fallow. You&#8217;d be amazed to discover that others before you have been facing, 90% of the time, the same challenges you have to overcome, the same problems you come across, and some dealt with them successfully. Thus, all you have to do is find out what their success formula was, adjust it to your specific situation, and watch the results! Easier said then done&#8230; </font></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri"><em>Not a barrier to your innovation and creativity!</em> On the contrary, if you know how many ways of dealing with a situation there are, you will always know which parts to simply apply as they are and which parts to improve.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Calibri">What is the final scope in b2b benchmarking?</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">The goal is to save time and effort by using a solution or success formula that has already produced results. First of all, you have to clearly determine what the situation you are dealing with is, and then you have to fallow the benchmarked steps. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Calibri">How do you choose the ones to benchmark yourself against?</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">You have to relate your benchmark to the goal or scope. If your goal is awareness, then you benchmark against the most famous brand or company name. If your goal is to raise a certain number of clients, then you benchmark to businesses that are successful in their business development activities, and so on. What&#8217;s important is that you clearly set your goal or scope for benchmarking. Sometimes, the one you choose to relate to can not and should not necessarily be in the same branch, as long as the situation or scope is similar. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Calibri">What are the criteria for benchmark? </font></strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">First of all, you need clarify your purpose. If your goal is, for instance, to become notorious, then you will consider brand related criteria, and the branding means trough which it became famous. For example, their marketing communications, the targeted audience, and the communication channels explored as well as the analysis of their brand evolution in time are some of the criteria. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Calibri">How do you use the benchmarking data you have collected?</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">There are tools, including software ones, for benchmarking. But benchmarking is a far more complex and vast process, and we are trying to simplify the matter with this post. The easiest way to do it is to register all these aspects in a map describing the benchmarked situation. Then, map your situation against it. You will notice some critical discrepancies between your map and the one that’s benchmarked against. You should start working on the parts which show major or critical discrepancies and commit to a program to mediate the important ones.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Calibri">Does this mean you have to copy?</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">There is so much &#8220;noise&#8221; around buzz such as “innovation” and “creativity” that people forget that we&#8217;ve learned to write, for instance, trough copying! Kids develop themselves tremendous by copying and modeling whatever they see in their environment. So there would not be any progress without copying and imitation. Imitation does not have to be a bad thing! Some successful companies have elaborate “follower” strategies meant to help them fallow the example set by market leaders<span style="color:red;"> </span>in order to quick start or fast advance to a certain level on the market. This works better in some stages against the chaotic strategies used in order to advance. But no, just because we relate to others it does not mean we have to imitate, but apply their effective solutions in our own specific way, or simply use the example they set in order to determine what we need to work on regarding our company. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Calibri">Why benchmark?</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">Many times we&#8217;re so caught in the situations we&#8217;re facing, that any extra management tool that will get you out of this loop will be helpful. Apart from viewing it as just another management tool, here are some of the benefits: </font></p>
<p style="text-indent:-0.25in;margin:0 0 0 0.5in;" class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><font face="Calibri">You will identify your <strong>niche</strong> for market success. By comparing your company to the successful ones, you&#8217;ll notice their weak points also. What are your company&#8217;s strong points to channel the efforts in covering those niches?. </font></p>
<p style="text-indent:-0.25in;margin:0 0 0 0.5in;" class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><font face="Calibri">You&#8217;ll become more <strong>organized </strong>in your marketing efforts. Sometimes, the things that concern us the most are not the critical or major ones. This process will automate your priorities when it comes to further development. </font></p>
<p style="text-indent:-0.25in;margin:0 0 0 0.5in;" class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><font face="Calibri">You&#8217;ll have <strong>confidence </strong>in your marketing efforts, knowing that your efforts have already been validated in a successful model. You’ll receive more support from the company, the team, and even from the market, for already validated plan easier to fallow.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:-0.25in;margin:0 0 0 0.5in;" class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><font face="Calibri">You know that you&#8217;re not reinventing the wheel and that you&#8217;re focusing on the correct aspects.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent:-0.25in;margin:0 0 10pt 0.5in;" class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><font face="Calibri">Last, this process costs less. </font></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">The process of benchmarking itself is far more complicated and laborious, but the steps described above are easily applicable immediately!</font></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Marketing systems that generate guaranteed sales results (II)</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">I hear more and more people complaining how difficult it is to sell. I stopped and wandered, why is it so difficult for us to sell, me included? Because I do not know how to sell, I know very well how to buy, and I can easily spot how everyone else around me is buying; it is seldom that I see a closed sale in which the customer was sold, and more than often when it’s so clear that the customer actually bought.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">I even went through sales processes and trainings, in the hope that this would make me a good sales person… but most of them solve some small problems, and some of them were good in guiding me to identify how customers buy. Somewhere along these lines, I understood that the best sales people never really sell, most of them help the customers buy. There are many steps to this process and we will approach them one by one to better understand that is the role of marketing in encouraging customers to buy. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">One of the first steps in this process is identifying how your customers buy today. How else will you be able to help them buy?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">In b2c that’s easier; you can have research studies, questionnaires, customer profiling and all sorts of tools, based on cold fact data. So you can map out this buyer behavior. How about in b2b? <span> </span>Well, as usual, you are on no man’s land. You can of course go through the same process as in B2C, and that will work, but it time and effort consuming, and the results are not guaranteed to be objective to your purpose. As I already accustomed you in this blog, I will take a step further and dare to throw in an alternative process, or shortcut to identifying buyer behavior. </font></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri"><span> </span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri"><span></span>First of all ASK! Yes, ask your customers and your potential customers. Use some of the questions below or make up your own questions, but always ask them. Do not try to put in any of your own opinions; even if you have a best intention, even if you come from the same field as they are in right now, even if you are a customer yourself for similar services, ask them, do not answer this only by yourself.<span style="display:none;"></span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri"><span style="display:none;"></span></font></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">What’s their motivation to buy?</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Do they have a strong reason to buy your product or service? This could be a legal or 3<sup>rd</sup> party enforced, it could be salving a critical problem or improving dramatically some part of the business, it could be a certain market shift or competition increase, the need to perform savings or improve operations and many more. Please make sure that the buying reason is stated in terms of specific requirements, activities, problems etc and not general terms.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Who is the decision maker in the buying process?</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Whom within the customer organization has the decision making power; who signs the contract? This is the person that buys, not anybody ales. If he buys from you or if he buys from someone within his own organization that you actually sold too… well that should provide you with some food for thought.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Who influences the purchase?</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Who advises the decision maker, who approves the purchase before it gets to be signed, who provides the information for the decision making, who has more power to advice or influence? This is usually either specific hierarchy within a certain business function, or the advisory group to the decision maker.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">What’s the criteria for selecting from different alternatives?</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Is it the brand, the references and background, the skills or the direct endorsements and social networking the bases of your customer’s criteria for selecting a provider?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Is there actually a process for purchase?</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Many times you’ll get an excuse that your offer did not got through to the purchase process. Well, as I said, that’s merely an excuse. Somewhere along the decision making chain someone did not wanted to buy. Find out this and help that person buy in your offerings. Purchase processes are good corporate excuses for the smart sales people that don’t take no for an answer. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">When and where are they buying?</font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">You can expand on this point as much as you want. Usually customers buy everywhere, from a social gathering to a billboard when walking by the street, they buy. So it’s a matter of being present where they are. If you did your segmentation correctly you already know where your customers are. Are you there yet? And I don’t just mean with advertising, but actually being there, getting involved in their association, supporting their efforts for a new government ruling in their sector and many, many more ways in which you can get involved to be present and be seen, so that you can be easily reached.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">How do you stand from the crowd? </font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">I already mentioned that if you are where your competition is, you are waisting your time. We’ll discuss some more on this point in the next post on positioning and differentiation, but for now it has to be clear, you have to be where no one else has gone before to have a winning long-term strategy. If you are where your competition is, the battle is on price and with that game, you and your competition will be buried alive… there’s no winners in this game.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Is it easy for your customers to know and reach you in the first place? </font></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span></strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Some companies make it very difficult for their clients to reach them. Are you everywhere where your customer might be looking for services and products that you provide? Not where you think they are looking.. .this is the catch… where they are actually looking. Do you know where your customer is looking? Did you asked?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">***</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">This is a simple list of question that will give you a lot to work on in understanding how your customer is actually buying. Be their purchase advisor, recommend something better if you truly think it’s just and you’ll get more business opportunities recommended after this than if you sold an account that you know you cannot execute at your best.<span>  </span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri"><span></span></font></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"><font face="Calibri">Find out what your customer is willing to buy and help him buy that… eventually from you. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;"></span><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif';">There’s much theory around this, but I am sticking to this simplified model of understanding how customers buy. It served many companies well so far. Let me know how it helped you.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>There’s so much literature about customer segmentation, that I had to fight with myself to actually write about this and not just dump a page full of links on this topic <span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Wingdings;"><span>J </span></span>But then, I pulled myself to it because segmentation does not work properly with many projects. Why? Because some “minor” detail will accidentally fall outside the big process of segmentation, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>your history on the market?</li>
<li>what’s your product roadmap?</li>
<li>are you competitive on the market segment, or you just added it to have a larger market to address?</li>
<li>And the list may go on…</li>
</ul>
<p>In B2C there are many segmentation models that work especially for creating different product or service offerings, but in B2B, I found it more efficient to apply segmentation mainly to drive lead generation, that is better targeting and positioning your offering with each segment.</p>
<p>Another challenge for me with this post: justify why you should segment your market before actually building up your positioning and USP. It is surprising, but most literature explains first how you build up your positioning and USP, and then go into market analysis and segmentation. I think that&#8217;s WRONG! (I do not use caps so often so this must be emphasized as a critical point here).</p>
<p>If you are to build your positioning, your USP (unique selling proposition) but you do not know yet whom you’re selling to, meaning what’s your segment, how are you actually going to do this? Well, one way this can work, is to address with your USP the same clients that you have today, which is not definitely wrong, but if you want to develop your business… and usually this is the whole point of strategic planning, than first you need to know your customer and only then you can develop the next steps in your planning. Even if  you only target development  in your own customer base, you still need to segment your market, otherwise you won’t be able to understand why they are your customers, and how can you keep them.</p>
<p><strong>Should you target the business or the decision maker within that business?</strong></p>
<p>Another issue we have in B2B, when segmenting …We’re not sure who’s the customer! Is it the business (with specific set of needs)? Or.. Is it the decision maker with individual goals and purposes on the job? For SMB it’s simple because we usually deal with individuals who run or have a direct participation in the business, so there is (a least in theory) a common ground between business development and decision maker’s needs. In targeting large business, challenge is so much more difficult. It’s worst when it’s a decision making committee of 2 or 3 people, than, segmentation based on persona’s becomes really messy.</p>
<p>So what do you do when your head starts spinning off on this dilemma? You can address these separately in your planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the business like?</li>
<li>Who’s the decision maker?</li>
<li>Who can influence the purchase decision?</li>
<li>What are the criteria for acquiring your type of products or services? for both business, individual or decision making groups.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom-UP!!! Start segmenting from within your customer base!</strong></p>
<p>In B2B best segmentation models follow a client profiling pattern. Meaning that first you have to describe in detail what type of customer you need than go up there on the big world and see where does this customer profile  can be found more often. This process make your marketing and sales efforts much more effective.</p>
<p>So what are some steps that can guide you on your segmentation?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What are your customers like?</strong><br />
Right now, what type of customers do you have and you want more of? Where and how did you reached them? What do they all have in common or do they behave in a specific way? What markets do you serve?<br />
This should give you a couple of valid points in profiling your customer, but it should also be a god opportunity for you to analyze your customer base and understand which clients are the type of clients that you’d like more for your business, where do you provide more value and which ones are more profitable.</li>
<li><strong>Where does your desired customer profile replicate?<br />
</strong>Based on common points identified above, brainstorm on where on the market you can find the same points? Clustering companies is usually very helpful in this step: do they all belong o a niche? are they all subscribed to a industry association? are they all clients of a certain supplier or do they all use a certain distribution channel? etc.</li>
<li><strong>With the segments you got from previous steps, how do you want to grow your business?</strong><br />
From what you result with in the previous steps, what  do you want to maintain and what to change? Any additional customer groups that your business could serve? Any new segments to enter with little or no effort?</li>
<li><strong>How will your targeted segments develop further?</strong><br />
The market segments that you identified, how are they developing further? Is there room for growth or are they on a decreasing trend? Which ones grow faster and where’s less competition for your business? Can you cross-reach </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Top-down! From a sea of businesses to the one island you need to thrive!</strong></p>
<p>Usually, in B2B I saw some segmentation models that seldom if not never work like segmentation based on company size, company type, number of employees, turnover etc. How can this be segmentation, really? This is more of a suspects catalogue  of categories than a market segment. Another long-desired and applied criteria, the vertical segmentation, is so generic that virtually anyone can be your customer within that vertical and it surely won’t help you in understanding your value, correct  targeting or generating leads. </p>
<p>This model comes from our need to standardize this process which in b2b is going to be difficult to achieve. For the ones that do dare to proceed with this criteria, at least please go with a cross analysis or a matrix of the above. It will bring you closer to your market segments but it won’t give you much to work with further in your planning. You’ll probably end up with a good potential customers’ classification, but not with your most desired segment.</p>
<p>To further get to a targeted segment, put your offering in front each framing you came up with in the matrix and see which one will require your offering. This way, you will identify each segment but   make sure you understand the distinctions between them, to address them correctly.</p>
<p><strong>How will business2business segmentation pay off?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will help you target exactly the right customers</li>
<li>It will help better position, easier acquire and retention customers.</li>
<li>It will help you correctly communicate with your targeted segments</li>
<li>You’ll be able to provide more value and explain your value better</li>
<li>You can gain a strategic position on a certain niche, to diminish competition</li>
<li>You’ll figure out how to drive further growth</li>
<li>Many, many, many more….</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there a more generic and standardized approach to segmentation?</strong></p>
<p>Well, none that I could find out, but there&#8217;s always room for creativity. So if you do find out of any other b2b segmentation process that works, drop a note here and I&#8217;ll be happy to include it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in b2b you know one size does not fit all. Take some of the steps indicated in the process above&#8230; I&#8217;ll bet on some quick visible results.</p>

Well if you start from “underground” it’s gonna be a bit more difficult to reach the moon, especially when you’re not sure where exactly you at are within this distance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">In order to succeed, in any planning process you have to understand clearly the starting point, meaning the t</span><sub><span style="line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">0</span></sub><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> situation in planning. I’ve seen “great” strategies that failed because of poor understanding or even consideration of this particular phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">You cannot make a giant ride a minibike!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">When did you actually evaluated last the situation you are now in, with the same depth and will as the achievements (or better yet the risks) you perceive in your desired actions and plans. By nature, we tend to superficially evaluate the current situation, because we are at this particular point and we want to get it done with, to get to the next step! By outrunning this, we put all our attention in considering the next step.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">In marketing planning especially, this tendency is even more emphasized, ‘cause marketing itself is future, development and business growth –oriented. However, as you’ll notice, the initial point and momentum, dramatically affects the success or the failure of the program. </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">The misunderstood initial points will give bad start in planning and execution, both, and will ofcourse contribute to teh eventual failure of a plan., program or campaign. </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Before taking and step further into your strategies, take a moment to consider the following (critical) aspects: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Are you aware and fully exploiting everything you actually got at this particular moment? </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Usually taken for granted, the products and services portfolio is not just your products and services. For example, support, guarantees, client assistance, brands, quality and account management and many more, are also parts of your offer. Although maybe you take them as “free of charge” and think they don’t require a special attention in designing and positioning your portfolio to your client, if you think about it really well, you can actually sell this items one by one… as a different component and in different “packages”; so look at them again and this time see what you actually can and should sell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">In general, these are seen as attributes, but when you think about your “whole” offer, these need particular attention and care, if you actually want to make money off of them; or don’t you </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Anything that brings value to your client is automatically a component of your portfolio…. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">It will be easier to sell your products and services if you understand this.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Another aspect worth considering si the way these components are connected or not, if they are packed or if there’s certain dynamics and dependencies in between them, etc. </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">All these thoughts can guide you in a storm of new ideas and opportunities to further exploit what you already got.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">How are products and services interacting within your portfolio?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">This really isn’t your everyday wake-up questing, is it </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">? If you considered this even once, you are one big step ahead.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">For example, you offer different products to different market segments. How do you administrate them without creating confusion and more, to secure your positioning with <span style="color:black;">each segment? This is an area where you can easily get conflicts between different components within your own portfolio. A classic example here is when you have products for both SMB and big customers. You try to offer both an accesible product, to strictly answer SMB requirements, and then you also have to offer a larger scale and scope product</span>, within great quality standards to big customers. In IT, for example, a lot of companies that offer enterprise solutions for very large corporations cannot, as much as they tried already, to accommodate in their portfolio solutions for small clients with the same success and vice versa. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">I’m not saying that it can’t be done, but, in this case, this audit of your own portfolio and dynamics must be done with a high level of caution and results need to be reflected upon.</span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span> </span></span></strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> </span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span></span>What are the opportunities in your current portfolio?</span></strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">At this moment, in your portfolio are many opportunities to continue exploiting the components of your own offer and find new revenue streams.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Can differently apply you product or service? Can other clients or market segments use it as well; with small changes, could you apply it differently, or can you outline all new benefits in a different context for your client?&#8230;etc&#8230;</span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span> </span></span></strong></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span></span>What are the limitations in your current portfolio?</span></strong></p>
<p></span><strong><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">If you noticed conflicts in your own portfolio in the above point, these are acting as limitation currently. Lack of certain products features or services extenstions that are critical for better exploiting your portfolio on the client side, require you to think of alternatives to respond their requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">A</span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">ny acknowledged limitation becomes an opportunity to develop your offer!</span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">The coverage to which you can expand the purpose of your products and services acts as limitations. Anytime you wish to add a new component to your portfolio you have to take each of above steps one at a time and make sure the certain addition doesn’t affect your current portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">You products and services portfolio is complete?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span></strong><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">When analyzing your portfolio with the above points, you will surely come up with ideas of either products or services improvement. In order to fulfill clients’ needs better, or to perform better tasks, to enlarge the scope or simply to satisfy your customer better, <span> </span>consider adding small features, benefits, additional “goodies” to your portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">The small additions need to be just that…”small”, but as you’ll notice these can be very impactful; just for a exemplification purposes, it’s enough to draw, a list of recommendations and references when they request a certain category of services that you do not perform, so that your customer can be satified and percieve you as more of a professional and caring company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Somtimes, it maybe be better to consider whether that certain service really is critical for your product’s usage, then, seriously consider providing this to your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">While performing the analysis suggested above, you will figure out exactly your current situation, you will find so much more to explore within your current portfolio, you will be able to control all the aspects of your offer that bring value to your clients and, probably, you will find many ideas for further development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">One challenge we have when executing a strategic plan is the first step, because there’s usually no logical path between the starting point and the finish. Well, this is the first step! Sometimes after performing this step you might even change the scope or your strategy to realize that your value and your offer needs to be developed in another area that you initialy thought of. You’ll figure out easy developments and logical steps to get your value proposing one step further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">The periodical evaluation of your portfolio of products and services, of your company’s offer, is critical for your company’s performance on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><em><strong>Note: </strong></em>An in-depth analysis of your products and services portfolio is “formally” performed in few ways. The most popular models are the Boston Consulting Group Matrix and the General Electric/Shell aka McKinsey / General Electric Matrix. Yet, these are methods that analyze the performance of products and services within the portfolio and don’t give out a clear view of the dynamics and opportunities in your current situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Georgia','serif';">However, these analysis will help you determine your product strategies; we will discuss about this in another post.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Objectives and marketing objectives by excellence would easily make up for a whole new discipline, the discipline of “where is everything going” </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">. But really, where are all marketing efforts going?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">If you read some of the posts in here you already must have understood I do not subscribe to “marketing is an art” but that it is in itself a science; an innovative one, yes, I agree. In this respect, when establishing new marketing strategies, policies, tactics or any other marketing-related needs, what are you actually paying for, are the expected results. In “before the execution” terms, you’re actually investing in meeting the <strong>objectives</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">So, what can we and what should we use when setting up marketing objectives in business to business? And more than that what should we pay for?</span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">If benchmarking is a structured approach for identifying the best practices in a certain area, than the first thing that comes to mind is let’s target the industry benchmarks with our objectives.<span>  </span>But when there&#8217;s such a </span><a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/marketing/2007/08/desperately-see.html" title="Desperately Seeking B2B Benchmarks"><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><font color="#800080">lack</font></span></a><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> of data on B2B Benchmarks, how do you actually setup the marketing objectives in B2B? <span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"><span></span></span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Why is this such a challenge in our sector? This is simple; in b2b, you don&#8217;t have a “mass” to research upon, the clients are not that &#8220;many&#8221; as in b2c; not to mention that reaching to decision makers in b2b is a challenge in itself due to their usually specific individual habits. The actual studies in this area are not even performed on the clients, but the <a href="http://b2b.questex.com/"><font color="#800080">markets themselves</font></a> are inquired to submit some numbers in order to draw conclusions (ie. about campaign results); so the process altogether is not that objective as in B2C where consumers are actually inquired. The only things that are better and better tracked from this perspective are the e-marketing campaigns in b2b but even there, there are many question marks before saying these can be benchmarked upon. The actual profile of the client is so specific with each business, and businesses are so careful to treat their clients in this respect, that I think there’s even a shyness into generalizing and benchmarking them into specific set of results, behaviors etc. (we’ll address this further into a future posting on market segmentation in b2b). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Before we go into the details of setting objectives, let’s see where do we start. We start form deriving marketing objectives from our business objectives. Here’s where most businesses fail at, since they don’t actually link the 2 and sometimes, they put marketing objectives without even looking at the business objectives. The worst is when the marketing manager is asked to come up with some proposals for marketing objectives, <span> </span>and the management committee will not get involved. The easiest way to test that is when the marketing manager actually asks for the marketing budget and then everyone suddenly starts asking questions to understand what money will be spent on. So how do you actually derive these objectives? We already touched practical case examples on how to get to marketing goals from company objectives in our earlier post on “<a href="http://btobmarketing.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/how-do-you-design-marketing-systems-that-generate-guaranteed-sales-results-i/" title="reference">How do you design marketing systems that generate guaranteed sales results</a>”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">From marketing goals it’s just one step further to the objectives, by adding a measurable to the goal, the expected result and a specific course of action. Ie:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>marketing goal</strong>: put a loyalty program/system in place translates into marketing objective: customer <strong>retention</strong> of “a”%</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>marketing goal</strong>: lead generation of [y] translates into “<strong>re-active</strong>”(or prospects that come into the sales pipe without a sales effort) sales from marketing channels of “a”% <span> </span>or a certain number</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>marketing goal</strong>: build awareness into [this] market translates into a <strong>branding</strong> objective</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>marketing goal</strong>: new product launch is a marketing goal of product branding, product <strong>success/market adoption or exposure</strong> metrics of “a” expected result</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>marketing goal</strong>: analyze the market, develop a positioning on the market and research for new prospects base, lead generation etc. translates into research objectives, new market identification, development of an USP etc</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">And many more… Other marketing objectives may derive from other business divisions; for example the need to employ qualified personnel and talent will require and employer branding program; or the change of some internal systems, processes and procedures might require corporate communications of change or development of own internal communications. Although some of this don’t directly fall into marketing, it should still employ marketing on the long run, and it’s best to keep marketing involved in any aspects of your business.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">However, these, as you see are objectives specific to each business needs. If you’d like to generalize, although I am not a particular fan of this, throughout marketing planning there are certain “themes “ or “guidelines” that will come up within your marketing objectives; this will rarely be accurately and comfortably to set, especially if you never used to set them up before, but we will address methods for fixing this as well. Some of the themes are inherited from B2C and are disputable to work for us, others are the knife &amp; bread for a B2B marketer. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Lead Generation</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> – this is closest related to the business development and this I think should be the masters of all objectives into b2b marketing strategies. Finding new customers should not be left solely to sales. Actually, best marketing programs should produce so much lead generation that your sales force should be busy full-time with just bringing those sales “home”. </span></li>
<li><span>Development of own<strong> portofolio of products and services </strong>aka Product Marketing</span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> – is an objective that needs to be specific for your own business; do not leave it general but setup metrics for what you need to achieve, if you need to although a product, setup metrics of market adoption, if you need to sustain it than it’s market exposure. So identify what phase in the product lifecycle are you on and set a specific metric for that.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Branding</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> – this is one of the inherited ones; some markets will argue that you can’t make it in b2b without a brand, some other will argue that in our sector, branding builds only organic, through referrals or good wom, and you cannot artificially push for building a brand; I agree with both </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> However, setting a branding objective into b2b is so challenging that I personally am not sure how other actually make it. <span> </span>It’s not difficult to set it but to measure it will be your challenge. (we’ll expore on just this topic sometime soon)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Channel strategy development</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> –since b2b channels are so complex, putting efforts into understanding, streamlining and developing those channels will just in itself pay off big time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Developments within own Customer Base </span></strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">– although in B2C, especially in highly competitive environments this is an objective that tops the marketing programs, I see many businesses disregarding this objective in <span> </span>b2b; since you already have a loyal customer why not sell him more, why not see what’s his other needs and meet them, why not get regular purchase? Quite recently we doubled a customer’s turnover just by promoting more intensively other service features and some new services in portofolio to the same customer base. So it would you like to gain more with less effort, work on your existing customer base.</span><strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Advertising</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> – there’s many ways in which you can promote yourself in b2b and other that just won’t work (see my view on tradeshows bellow). <span> </span>Since this is a generous topic we’ll dedicate it a full post soon.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">Communication objectives</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"> or PR objectives – are rarely targeted in our side of the industry, and they are usually part of a branding or new product launch. I agree to this, but I would like to suggest here a new approach to setting objectives in PR for b2b. Do it for sales. Make sure that when your sales guy gets his foot on a prospect’s door, that prospect already knows or heard about you in the last week. That will come in handy. Since PR is not even expansive, and it can also feed you with other valuable market information, do it right and you’ll get some results. Also, choose PR to generate good will or good wom on your potential employees, potential partners and suppliers and other business stakeholders. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';"></span><span style="font-family:'Georgia','serif';">With any marketing plan please setup between 3 to 5 maximum objectives that are specific to your priorities. You should go as a process from your company objectives o your marketing objectives. Since we mentioned lack of benchmarks we will start formulating objectives from company’s own marketing track record, consulting own personnel and<span>  </span>other similar programs up there; however since you started from your own marketing needs, coming up with measurable and expected results should not be a challenge. <span> </span>It will be the mastery of your marketing team to make it and since there are not too many rules on out sector, there’s really little arguments why they shall not reach any objectives. </span></p>
<p><span>Before we step into the segmentation and market analysis, we’ll stop next onto a marketing audit of your own portfolio of services and products and you’ll notice how important it is to perform a thorough audit, when engaging into any marketing planning activity. As you’ll see by adjusting small things in what you already have, with little of no effort you’ll get more results than engaging into expansive new programs.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><span>Strange coincidence that just when I was to set off writing about objectives I enrolled into a week-end training on personal development where a big chunk of it was about setting objectives; of course personal objectives, but let’s face it, what’s really different in the process of <span> </span>setting a company objectives than when setting personal objectives? </span></p>
<p>So why do you need objectives? And I mean in any area, why do you need objectives? Some of the answers to this inquiry may be: it’s definitely easier to shoot at a target that you identified, rather to just shoot and hope something will fall out of the sky.<br />
Plus, once you identified the aim, your actions and your team/ your company’s actions have a sense&#8230; that is to get the target in site and shoot for it. And there are many more reasons why it’s important&#8230;</p>
<p>Before setting your company objectives, it’s best if you seat together with your team and actually identify why it’s important for you and your team to set objectives for the company or for certain activities and processes? Do not proceed further until you have identified about three to five reasons why you need to set up objectives, so that you will understand why is this important for you and your team, and so that you and your team will be motivated and involved into this process.</p>
<p>Now that you know why you’re doing this, it appropriate to choose a method for setting objectives, in accordance to your needs. My soon to be ex favorite method was the SMART (you can Google it if you’re not familiar with the acronym; there’s too much good literature on this one). Although I always had a „sweet tooth” for the SMART method of setting objectives, there was something about the “Attainable” and the accountability or “measurable” attributes in the SMART method that did not fully justified how some people or companies realize so much more than what would be realistic, achievable and timely for them in a given timeframe. Today it just hit me, you have to perform a goal setting process similar to a personal goal setting system.</p>
<p>For example personal goals need to be positive and in your control; you cannot wish for the competition to die or vanquish from the market :)… because that is not in your reach, in other words you cannot control it… whatever objective you shoot for it must be within your control, you have to own it and it’s accomplishment. So, you could set a goal to be better at this game, by going onto a new market, developing the next product, making your customers loyal, having a better management of your finances etc; yes, on the long run this strategy will put some competitors of the market, but it’s not your goal; your goal is that you will be “better”.</p>
<p>Identifying those elements that will make your company and your team “better” is the basis of your objective setting. If we&#8217;re to take a real case scenario, your goal it’s a certain turnover but your final objectives needs to be in terms of what change you need to make within the company, so that you can achieve that financial objectives. How is the company now and how does it &#8220;needs to be”, what are the resources you can use to perform the change and could you assume as the actual “price/cost” of the change? Will your company still function in the same business environment, and how will this environment perceive and react to these changes? And that technique is actually borrowed from a personal development technique.</p>
<p>Unlike the limitations of the SMART model, in this model, make the objectives relevant to your own company following the above steps. When completing this, you also need to perform it with your team and make sure it’s a collective result. You need them to understand, agree and commit to the accomplishment of these objectives, because otherwise we have often seen wrong in execution due to the lack or mis- understanding of the objectives. It’s also your team that will be responsible for execution so you need them very motivated when they need to “get going”.</p>
<p>Never set objectives without making them relevant for each of your management staff. Brake down the company objectives at their individual level, clarifying what each has to achieve, but also making sure that in the process they will support each other, ‘cause corporate cannibalism can really affect your final result.This process would take very little time and effort and a lot of creativity or innovation.</p>
<p>What I am proposing here is a more flexible way of setting objectives rather than the rigid traditional ones. Your company is unique, you team is too, who’s to say you can’t be the first to land on the “moon” with corporate services or solutions, whatever this “moon” means for you. If you and your team are up to it…</p>
<p>Since our focus is on marketing in this blog, we’ll explore further in a future post, how to set <a href="http://btobmarketing.wordpress.com/2007/09/18/objectives%e2%80%a6-or-where-are-all-marketing-efforts-supposed-to-be-going/" title="marketing objectives">marketing objectives</a> in b2b.</p>
