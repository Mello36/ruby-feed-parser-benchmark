&lt;p&gt;Jonathan can you work on adding Mac OS as a choice for your sun ray solution?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Work with apple or maybe partner with:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Connect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel that thin client adoption will accelerate, and you should position your company to get the most out of it. Having the most flexible product will help you ... Also some ad campaign would not hurt .... (pc guy and mac guy can be joined by ray, who is way more power efficient)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am sure I am not the only one who thought about this...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you know the mac is gaining ground on the desktop...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mentioned that nobody call you back regarding the OpenSSO issue. If you have a ticket number, post it. I guess you have paid Sun for OpenSSO Enterprise edition which including License and Service agreement. Sun should be responsible of solving your issue.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re using OpenSSO Express Edition which is free and open sourced on Internet, then you are on your own. If somebody in Sun promise you on any official support, it must be a mistake and his/her manager will not allow this happen. For the opensource version, you can only use Opensso forum or Sun&apos;s JavaES forum for help. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s the way Sun make money on software. Now you have a need, pay for it, then Sun&apos;s stock goes up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Jonathan,&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It looks like a positive move... The future of cloud computing is in Enterprise Content Management solutions. Sophisticated storage management and optimization solutions are needed here... Now this will align well with Open Source Enterprise Content Management Solutions... You just need to put this in the picture and your definately headed for the cloud. Lets talk about OpenOffice and Open Source ECM alternatives to Microsoft Office and Sharepoint. That will guarantee more revenue and exposure to markets investing into the potential behind cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome to see these wins Jonathan - proof positive of your strategy. I hope this goes a long way to silencing the critics who keep asking how Sun is supposed to monetize off open source. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, I received an interesting phone call today - out of the blue - by a Sun sales rep. She thanked me for viewing the Sun Storage 7000 demo videos, and asked if I wanted to know more, view technical information, or trial a unit. What a pleasant surprise to have this happen (I only ever get called by Dell), and it&apos;s what you guys need to do more of. If there ever was a perception that Sun make it difficult for small operations to go with Sun, this is clearly something that you are making an effort to change! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well Johnathan, you do the right things in my opinion, SUN is aware of the OpenSource community and invests a lot of time and education in it. Great!&lt;br/&gt;
But I am not shure if Americans see, that you invest into the right place, but I do. Already most of the applications I use make use of JAVA, nearly everyone knows OpenOffice.org, I use NetBeans for development, EXIST is a JAVA driven XML-database, Tomcat is an extremely powerful webapplication-server and glassfish is another shining community-driven diamond.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wish you good luck, hope all your dreams come true next year and you&apos;ll be able to satisfy your investors...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you be offering open storage as a networked cloud service? The FISHworks interface runs on any web browser anywhere, so you could host the hardware while data owners managed their storage from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please setup a contest for all freelance/open source developers to come out with idea&apos;s to make star/openoffice much better product to compete with MS office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Setup a penal to review the idea&apos;s Reward who has submitted great idea and if required hire that gut to head the development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember M$ earns significant money from office suite.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During this slowdown , what is the motivating factor for IT/CIO to go&lt;br/&gt;
and buy the Sun server? they can still continue to use the old server&lt;br/&gt;
in the market and still be productive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have seen many F500 companies doing such things in the past , they&lt;br/&gt;
go to an extent of even not signing up for AMC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;over all these things, Ultrasparc has stopped sparking in front of&lt;br/&gt;
AMD/Intel cpu&apos;s, although commodity cpu&apos;s they work faster and better&lt;br/&gt;
then Ultrasprc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have seen only sprc64 cpu&apos;s beat Intel (wood crest) by a margin of&lt;br/&gt;
2-3xbut price for a sprc64 cpu based servers 3-5x more.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So what can you do to be profitable during this time, answer is get&lt;br/&gt;
into commodity laptop/desktop market, make a deal with AMD/Intel to&lt;br/&gt;
supply CPU&apos;s with good credit (time) ,start retailing the&lt;br/&gt;
laptops/desktops involve your engineering team do better power&lt;br/&gt;
management, make the hardware compatibility for Ubuntu/Mac OsX/Solaris&lt;br/&gt;
10 -x64/ and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Make strategy to sell the the basic system offer things like&lt;br/&gt;
wireless/HDMI/card reader etc ... with small fee and hardware/software&lt;br/&gt;
code to unlock the feature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Come out with Solaris lite(RTOS) for Smartphones/PDA , invest in&lt;br/&gt;
making Looking glass desktop to have smaller memory footprint and&lt;br/&gt;
better user experience, Hire key people from the Open source community&lt;br/&gt;
to this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most important : read this link , don&apos;t fire your employees&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see Sun Sales is a big bottleneck, I have a small business in India, Myself been a geek I love Sun Products and the innovation it brings and wanted the best workstation which Sun has and its been many weeks I am trying to understand how do I get one. I tried the Sun Sales call center, they don&amp;rsquo;t know anything, they say they will call back, takes the mobile number, all details, and no call till date I receive. They I got to the VAR list published in Sun site and call this guys randomly, They are not approachable at all, I guess they are least helpful. Now out of total frustration, I approaches dell, I go to their website and after giving the quote, they are very prompt in calling and understanding the requirement. I have not yet made the purchase decision. But I seriously think Sun needs to get out of this VARs model or try to improve the customer experience.  I love Sun, The sales process needs a complete overhaul and it should be friendlier with small business in their purchase decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice work on new 7k series of storage. Really a move forward from traditional storage, embracing new tehnologies. But why Sun Storage label? Hart of this new product is SSD drive which eliminate the need for storage cache. And in 1978 StorageTek developed the first modern type of solid-state drive. Makes sense to name it StorageTek Unified Storage System, don&apos;t you agree? &lt;br/&gt;
When we can expect to see FC and FEoE connections and FC drives? With price well in end-to-end FC storage solutions range, it is logical te expect this kind of features, optionaly at least. Bottom line, you only need pair of front-end and back-end FC controllers (you allready have FC enclosures).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Jonathan, Sorry for not congratulating you for the feat - I feel Sun just doesn&apos;t like customers, the prime reason the company is in red! We inquired about OpenSSO support from Sun India, and was told someone will get back to us with details. It&apos;s been 72 hours and haven&apos;t heard from anyone!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You know, I&apos;m a big fan of Sun, but haven&apos;t bought any stock yet - reason is that I check how they treat their customers, and I haven&apos;t got any service that makes me smile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hope you&apos;d fix your sales, support and marketing soon before the time runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of OpenOffice.org... I recently developed Screenwright(R), an OOo template for screenwriters, and it just won a cash award from Sun - thank you!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If this screenwriting template could be included as an integral part of an upcoming OpenOffice.org 3.x release, it will send a clear signal--to filmmakers in particular and to the Entertainment sector in general--that OpenOffice.org is ready to address the industry&apos;s unique text-processing and -formatting needs. News travels fast among members of the Entertainment industry, and they tend to be the gatekeepers and style leaders for the culture at large.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To publicize Screenwright(R)&apos;s inclusion in OOo, I propose to set up and run a short screenplay competition under the aegis of Sun/OOo. The winning scripts will be produced and showcased in a YouTube-like display area. I would establish strategic partnerships with a wide range of film schools (such as USC, NYU and UCLA), so their top directing students will have the opportunity to translate the best contest scripts into films. Depending on the number of entries and the size of the entry fee, this project could easily support itself, and even become a (minor) profit center for Sun.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What do you think, Jonathan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to see Sun&apos;s community starting to enjoy the fruits of their labour, no doubt there&apos;s much more to come, as Sun continues to expand  its customer base.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A growing customer base with smaller individual sales leads to greater financial security, your less subject to the ebb and flow of markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great news Jonathan!  Glad to see you structuring the company for better innovation and success over the me too feeling I have felt for the last couple of years.  That said, why the small print on the OpenOffice news?  I understand that it appears that you are pulling the rug out from everyone that believed you were really going to support an OSS business, but don&apos;t be sneaky about it.  Be bold about it.  With the emergence of the Web as a platform, applications of old that may have practiced in a monopolistic market (M$ Office) are being reinvented on the web and a new race is starting.  With StarOffice, and your previous work with the StarPortal, now is a better time than ever to take on delivering Office as a Service and it looks like you are taking on that endeavor.  Why the apologies .. its just business, right?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with the train of thought around advertising, I work for Sun and have done now for nearly 10 years and its never ceased to amaze me as to how little we do in fact to sell ourselves.  Whenever I meet someone and the ask me who I work for and I say Sun Microsystems 9 times out of 10 there&apos;s always a blank look on their face and this really hacks me off .... We&apos;ve had and we&apos;ve still got some brilliant products and technologies and we should be shouting these from the rooftops ! We expect our sales force to get out there and do the business yet from a corporate point of view we don&apos;t make their lives any the easier. What is wrong with spending money on advertising ? Everyone else does it and is doing it ! We are in danger of slowly slipping away and personally I think we should now start fighting ... So come on start spending some of those billions of dollars putting us out there, start putting your money where your mouth is, if we don&apos;t believe in ourselves then how can we expect to grow in a climate where 90% of the population doesn&apos;t even know who Sun Microsystems are ?  A nice snappy advertising campaign, nothing dull and boring, something people will remember and more importantly understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I am the only person who finds this agreement as odd.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OpenOffice is a direct competitor to Microsoft Office.  MySQL is a competitor to SQL Server.  I find it extremely hard to believe that Microsoft will push MySQL anywhere that the public will actually see.  Setting up with Microsoft explains why Suns Office product got dropped from the google pack.  Furthermore, Google seems to be going against java.  I downloaded the craptastic browser &amp;quot;Chrome&amp;quot; and it did not include java support by default.  There was also a fiasco about java and android a while back.  Java is slooooooooow and bloated which make these two a match made in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you seem to agree that developers are important, I need to insist on the point already made by Radu and Lucian. For about a month, downloads from Romania are being blocked. I have just tried another download and unfortunately nothing has changed. Download center support exchanged a few email with me just to eventually let me know that the Download Center has problems, and that&apos;s where it all stopped. I am teaching at the local university operating systems and Java programming. This means I need Java and Solaris. I now have access to none, and I am not sure how to explain this to my students. Many companies in my city rely on Java, and there are many more all over Romania. This means countless developers. I am worried about this situation and the word about Java not being available for download anymore is starting to spread. I do not know the nature of the Download Center problems, but if fixing them takes more than a month, it may be of interest to offer alternative download options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenOffice&apos;s strength is that it&apos;s gaining momentum as a viable alternative.  Please don&apos;t quash this product&apos;s popularity by adding adverts to it.  You&apos;ll result in alienating a lot of people, like me, who&apos;ll either stay with an older version, fork the software or move to something else.  Where&apos;s the proof that advertising will work either for Sun or for the sponsors?  I, like many, have never clicked on a Google Ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey JS,&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know these are hard times, however I&apos;d like to continue developing (playing) on Sparc, with decent 3D stereo graphics support and Niagara 2. Can you sell a tower version of your servers that have the ability to install full height graphics cards? Who cares if the PCIExpress connection&apos;s only x8, it doesn&apos;t make that much difference to performance, we can just beef up the graphics ram.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yep those NVidia Quadro&apos;s will run under X Windows, without FCode support, provided Nvidia compile the binaries, no, they wont display the console, so make sure it also includes an XVR-300 or serial port for console.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;See, it&apos;s just a bit difficult to do without Sun.  Let us play, you just never know where it&apos;ll lead to ;)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Market them as tower servers and research dev servers, with plenty of SATA/SAS disk bays, make sure Nvidia provide the Cuda dev libraries too, the Graphics Cards can be optional extras. Bare bones, they&apos;ll also make great SMB servers with SunRays, StarOffice 9 and all the Free Software you can think of pre loaded (accessible from sensibly laid out menu&apos;s), in these hard times SMB&apos;s don&apos;t need to purchase a rack, Sparc&apos;s proven rock solid reliability will bring enormous savings, given time, TCO remember.  Service / support can mostly be provided remotely.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;N.B. Imagine the excitment this will generate among the developers, developers, developers and researchers.  This wont be a costly exercise for Sun, it&apos;ll just generate more interest, in the same way that retailers move around their shop front contents to attract more customers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Peter&lt;/p&gt;
