The data, which comes from market researcher NPD Group, shows that U.S. retail sales of video game hardware, software and accessories has jumped nearly 10 percent, compared to November last year.  Nintendo was the most successful in November, with them selling over 2 million Wii&amp;#39;s, which according to Denise Kaigler, vice president of corporate affairs at Nintendo, is the most consoles Nintendo have sold in a single month since the console&amp;#39;s launch in late 2006.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/12/november-video-game-sales-near-3-billion'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/gX5FActHLJ0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Matthew Hopson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2008 11:54:57 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/12/november-video-game-sales-near-3-billion</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/12/wiredcom-best-pc-games-of-2008</guid><title> Wired.com: Best PC Games of 2008</title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/f1GCzPW-HF8/wiredcom-best-pc-games-of-2008</link><description>Making a list of the best PC games of the year is an impossible task.  First, consider that most of the truly top-tier gaming experiences to be had on personal computers this year actually fell into the Multi-Platform awards category, so Fallout 3 and the like weren&amp;#39;t eligible. Also consider that Wired.com writers include voracious players of browser games, MMOs, and independent games, and the nominations list was bound to be a scattershot pile of unrelated games.  Thus, that&amp;#39;s precisely what we&amp;#39;re giving you: Five games that we enjoyed playing in 2008 that are utterly impossible to directly compare.

The hit PC game, Sins of a Solar Empire, took the award for "Best Strategy Game of 2008".

At the end of October, EA warned on profits and announced plans to cut between 500 and 600 jobs. Now it has said that its performance will fall short of already low forecasts, although it will not make an updated forecast until February.  The company said it had been hit by the growing market share of Nintendo&amp;#39;s Wii console, because Nintendo also makes most of the top-selling games for the console. EA said it would now try to make additional cuts to its costs on top of those announced in October.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/12/electronic-arts-warns-on-profits'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/s6950Y88UEo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Haddaway</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2008 08:01:06 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/12/electronic-arts-warns-on-profits</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/10/spore-tops-list-of-top-ten-most-pirated-games</guid><title> Spore tops list of top ten most pirated games</title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/xw4XyPOt9bk/spore-tops-list-of-top-ten-most-pirated-games</link><description>Will Wright&amp;#39;s evolution based game, Spore, is the most pirated game of 2008, according to a list of the top ten most pirated games, posted on the TorrentFreak blog last Thursday.   TorrentFreak used data collected from torrents in order to create the list, which also estimated The Sims 2 to be the second most downloaded game, followed by Assasins Creed.   According to the statistics published by TorrentFreak, Spore has been downloaded over 1.7 millions times since it&amp;#39;s release in September, making it not only the most pirated game in 2008, but also the most pirated game ever.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/10/spore-tops-list-of-top-ten-most-pirated-games'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/xw4XyPOt9bk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Matthew Hopson</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2008 13:53:16 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/10/spore-tops-list-of-top-ten-most-pirated-games</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/10/playstation-home-arriving-as-open-beta-from-thursday</guid><title> PlayStation Home Arriving as Open Beta From Thursday</title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/gX1CdRnuNoY/playstation-home-arriving-as-open-beta-from-thursday</link><description>Sony Computer Entertainment will open up its Home online virtual environment to all PlayStation 3 users from Thursday, it said Wednesday.  Home allows users to create their own avatars and participate in a real-time virtual world, something like a cross between the Mii avatars on Nintendo&amp;#39;s Wii and the Second Life community. Users can interact with others through voice and text chat and the service also offers mini-games, videos and special events.  The opening up of the beta test, which has been anticipated for sometime, follows several delays for the service. It was first unveiled in July 2007 and initially promised for a global release later that year but was pushed back once to early this year.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/10/playstation-home-arriving-as-open-beta-from-thursday'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/gX1CdRnuNoY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Daniel Fleshbourne</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2008 10:41:00 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/10/playstation-home-arriving-as-open-beta-from-thursday</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/08/soulja-boy-making-his-gaming-debut-on-the-xbox-360</guid><title> Soulja Boy making his gaming debut on the Xbox 360</title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/wHBxHiOcieQ/soulja-boy-making-his-gaming-debut-on-the-xbox-360</link><description>In a recent interview with the Complex Blog, Soulja Boy revealed plans to release a video game based on himself. Following his inspiring review of the Xbox Live Arcade title Braid and his challenge to find someone who can beat him at Gears of War, Halo 3 or Call of Duty 4, Soulja Boy reportedly sparked the interest of unnamed gaming companies. Having discussed the proposal with his record label, the plans have apparently been given the green light. The game is slated for a 2009 release.  Soulja Boy, famous for his catchy debut single, claimed to have reacted to the news with the words "Oh snaps!".  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/08/soulja-boy-making-his-gaming-debut-on-the-xbox-360'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/wHBxHiOcieQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Michael Brown</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2008 21:09:20 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/08/soulja-boy-making-his-gaming-debut-on-the-xbox-360</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/08/2k-and-ea-to-use-nvidia-physx-technology</guid><title> 2K and EA to use NVIDIA PhysX technology</title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/aAwpboWNy9w/2k-and-ea-to-use-nvidia-physx-technology</link><description>Both EA Games and 2K Games have licensed the NVIDIA PhysX engine for use by the studios.  EA had already implemented PhysX technology in Mirrors Edge for the PC. The PhysX engine "works across all major gaming platforms, including Nintendo Wii, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC", which means we should expect to see PhysX technology in use on EA&amp;#39;s and 2K&amp;#39;s games in the future.  When PhysX was first released, on an individual PCI card, it received a less than lukewarm welcome; only a handful of games had support for it, and the card retailed at about &amp;#36;180 (about &amp;#65533;100 in the UK) &amp;#65533; over half the price of a mid-range graphics card.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/08/2k-and-ea-to-use-nvidia-physx-technology'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/aAwpboWNy9w" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Sam Alderwick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2008 20:37:32 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/08/2k-and-ea-to-use-nvidia-physx-technology</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/05/konami-website-hints-at-next-metal-gear-coming-to-xbox-360</guid><title>Konami website hints at next Metal Gear coming to Xbox 360 </title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/4JDtDM3pxKA/konami-website-hints-at-next-metal-gear-coming-to-xbox-360</link><description>A new official Metal Gear website by Konami has sent rumour mills spinning with word that the cryptic message is a sign that the next instalment will be coming to the Xbox 360. Little is known about the site, and the only words displayed are the Konami logo and an equation, with the subtitle "A Next Metal Gear Is...". Not much to worry over until you realise the equation is written in the signature Xbox green, and the result looks suspiciously like the 360&amp;#39;s green power button.  Word of an Xbox 360 Metal Gear Solid has persisted for years, with Hideo Kojima himself denying the existence of a 360 version of the fourth iteration in the series.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/05/konami-website-hints-at-next-metal-gear-coming-to-xbox-360'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/4JDtDM3pxKA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Michael Brown</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2008 16:32:07 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/05/konami-website-hints-at-next-metal-gear-coming-to-xbox-360</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/04/microsoft-releases-new-nxe-avatar-clothing</guid><title> Microsoft releases new NXE Avatar clothing</title><link>http://feeds.neowin.net/~r/neowin-gamers/~3/BUt_FGZPgho/microsoft-releases-new-nxe-avatar-clothing</link><description>Flying in the face of those that thought Microsoft would be charging for any and all upgrades to the NXE clothing range comes the news that the range has just been updated. For the low price of "absolutely nothing", you can now kit out your Avatar in stylish new winter gear, including a snowboarding jacket.  Admittedly, the update is a very small one, but the fact that Microsoft haven&amp;#39;t dragged their heels over updating the virtual wardrobe so close to the initial release of the NXE can only be seen as a good sign. What new clothing would Neowinians like to see?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/04/microsoft-releases-new-nxe-avatar-clothing'&gt;Read full story...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neowin-gamers/~4/BUt_FGZPgho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Michael Brown</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 07:49:01 +0000</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/08/12/04/microsoft-releases-new-nxe-avatar-clothing</feedburner:origLink></item>
