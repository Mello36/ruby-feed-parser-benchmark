It would be a high energy, relentlessly positive person. It would be someone self-motivated and self-sufficient, able not only to visualize complex projects but also to carry them through to fruition. He or she could engage strangers and embrace ambiguity. He sees the down streams and the downsides of any plan and adjusts accordingly. And so on."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I read that post by Seth at least twice, seeing if I could mentally measure myself up to his ideal. I can't say that I felt I was. But in B2B, you have to be more pragmatic. Murray, from the vantage of retired marketer/sales VP saw the hole in the perfection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was something missing from his description, however. The perfect marketer must also be the perfect politician. The astute marketer knows that, in a perfect world, all things are possible. But in a highly volatile world, where people see their investments and imagine their lives going down the rabbit hole, where Boards are insecure and CEOs intractable and budget cuts inescapable, not all things are possible. Indeed, most things – even the small things and especially the right things – require a great deal of personal conviction and much cleverness to gain the collaboration of those in high places if projects are to ever see the light of day."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now, &lt;a href="http://www.viewfromthecorneroffice.com/management/the-marketer-perfected/"&gt;Murray&lt;/a&gt; is not the first to pick on Seth. But in this case, he adds value. Because without conquering the politics, your ideas remain just that--yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;(Hmmm. Looks like I've given Murray the same one-name treatment. Completely unplanned, honest.)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3471387&amp;postID=2708649977266751041' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/2708649977266751041'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/2708649977266751041'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.b2blog.com/2008/11/marketers-attitude-perfected.htm' title='The Marketer&apos;s Attitude, Perfected'/><author><name>Dave J.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10115353782861719126</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3471387.post-324918246019274060</id><published>2008-11-18T14:09:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-18T14:17:31.432-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dave now on Twitter</title><content type='html'>1.

(Of course you can just create a page from scratch, too.) The tracking/to-do lists tool is great! Organization is pretty easy, at least for the few pages I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is part of our Google Apps account, it is easy to share this project across the company. That maybe the hardest part of Sites, which is getting others to join in and use my content and add their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll have to throw all my basic marketing to-dos and projects on Sites next.

But it gave the sales reps a chance to engage visitors to see if they 'won'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the show got slow on Friday, the reps actually tried to see how many of the stars they could give away.

So are their engineering-type users. So here is a cool desktop thingy they have released for free: &lt;a href="http://www.thomasnet.com/tools-gadgets/toolbox/help.html"&gt;The ThomasNet Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshot:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://b2blog.com/uploaded_images/tn-tool.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does just enough for a marketer to be useful. And as it hangs out in a normally dead zone of your screen (the very top), its not in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The screen capture lets you select the part of the screen to capture. Saves me a step cropping, especially if doing the same shot repeatedly. (Good for engineers making instructions, too.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Color palette tool picks colors off your screen and gives you coding. I forgot about this feature and was doing things the hard way this morning, copy-and-pasting Hex color numbers from a CSS to see what color they really were.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rulers help you measure items on your screen ... again helpful for marketers and engineers. (I do have a &lt;a href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/measureit/"&gt;cool Firefox plug-in&lt;/a&gt; that does this, as well.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who-knows when the magnifier may come in handy. I know Windows has one, but couldn't tell you how to call it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I normally hate post-it desktop tools, but who knows, I may use this one since it is attached to these other useful items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are stuck looking at "ThomasNet.com" all day in your header area. If it pays off, people will use the first item in the toolbox, which is a link to their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;I've picked on TN for posting other web-stuff that didn't really do the job, but this one is a winner.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3471387&amp;postID=3745696363364070039' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/3745696363364070039'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/3745696363364070039'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.b2blog.com/2008/09/cool-tool-for-hands-on-marketers-from.htm' title='A cool tool for hands-on marketers from ThomasNet'/><author><name>Dave J.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10115353782861719126</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3471387.post-7659100894854435562</id><published>2008-09-18T08:49:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2008-09-18T11:33:06.266-04:00</updated><title type='text'>Rant: Logging in shouldn't be this hard</title><content type='html'>One of our client's just sent a PO notification.

Does not work with Firefox.&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not give any warning about not working with firefox.&lt;br /&gt;3. Tells me my user/pass is incorrect instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...

I get a temporary password.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Now I have to select my secret question and secret answers? Why, why, why, do I have to select my secret questions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.

Then provide an answer.

The message was a bit vague, but promised a new way of generating leads via webforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to ignore spammy messages, but to save you, my readers, the trouble, I took a look at their website to see what the deal was. Here's there quick run-down (less their brand name):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. You tell XXX what industries you want to target&lt;br /&gt;2. You specify the geographic areas&lt;br /&gt;3. Choose the plan, that fits your objectives with the maximum number of 'form submissions' &lt;br /&gt;4. XXX proprietary technology then scours the web for industry and geographic matches.&lt;br /&gt;5. XXX pulls the data in, ranks them, and submits your contact info &amp;amp; sales message. XXX  populates the forms it determines most meet your target objective as qualified sites.&lt;br /&gt;6. You get oodles ultra targeted, interested, incoming calls/emails quickly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 151, 0);font-family:Helvetica Neue Black;" &gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;So, the assumption is that people forwarding webleads will helpfully forward your request to the correct person in the company. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine this may work as a back-door to sales and marketing departments. It may also work because it is a less common approach. But I don't think there is a whole lot of reason to think it is more worthwhile than other marketing techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it is just another spamming method, I think.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3471387&amp;postID=6128166824269325704' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/6128166824269325704'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/6128166824269325704'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.b2blog.com/2008/09/turning-others-webforms-into-lead.htm' title='Turning others&apos; webforms into lead generators?'/><author><name>Dave J.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10115353782861719126</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3471387.post-6012872782097566293</id><published>2008-09-08T15:17:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2008-09-08T15:40:24.053-04:00</updated><title type='text'>Finding a clunker in AdWords</title><content type='html'>At the beginning of August, I broke down my AdWords campaign into more keyword-centric 'ad groups'. Now I am able to look at the results of a whole month, and I'm glad I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I had about 20% less click-thrus. But wait, I had 40% MORE conversions. The conversion rate nearly doubled over July. Cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reviewing the data for individual keywords, I had one clunker of a keyword I am completely stumped by.  Here's the situation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its the number one keyword for this particular ad-group, lets call it 'tennis shoe'. I even pay a premium over my normal maximum CPC for this term to make sure I am listed well versus the competition. Right below it with almost identical views is 'tennis shoes'.

That alone should take the pressure off. How do you write about it? How do you talk about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boss and company president died last week of a heart attack here at the office. Joe was a too young 56. The gap in our business is huge, as well as a personal loss of someone I have worked with for almost 18 years. And the shock of realizing I could just walk away from the office, something that he would never be able to do again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the marketer, I realized I had to put something on the website. People are going to be looking for news about it. It was 11pm at night when I finally posted something. One of our overseas reps had sent an email of condolences, and I guess seeing it in print made it real enough that I could talk about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed what I had posted in the morning to a co-worker who made two comments: we should check with his wife first; and it sounded too newsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disabled the post waiting for approval, and replaced some of my text with someone else's "we regret to inform you...". Turns out that the approval never came. But for at least a few hours the news was right on our website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I realized, and was willing to accept, is that in certain situations, dignity and respect are more important than directness and timeliness. The writing style that I use here and on my company website needs to be dialed back, even to the point that the voice no longer seems to be mine. Who really wants to read a death announcement written by someone who was there and personally affected by it anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, the funeral service had this third-person feel. Part of the problem is that the pastor never acknowledged that a whole company was wondering 'what's next?' I hope that the family felt comforted by her words about his family life, but I wanted her to acknowledge my pain, my worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I settled for accepting that our presence there was to comfort the family as well. And the family was very gracious and heartfelt in meeting with everyone who was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do you say? What do you write? Who's your audience? Will you make others (or yourself) cry? Are you direct and personal, or formal and polite? Does it gloss over the ugliness or make it real to others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these questions for someone who has to communicate, never mind the personal thoughts one has about the passing of a colleague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shalom Joe Hamm.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3471387&amp;postID=7048827888518329154' title='9 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/7048827888518329154'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/7048827888518329154'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.b2blog.com/2008/08/how-do-you-write-about-it.htm' title='How do you write about it?'/><author><name>Dave J.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10115353782861719126</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3471387.post-4087351391292069973</id><published>2008-07-31T09:08:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2008-07-31T09:20:52.043-04:00</updated><title type='text'>AdNonsense Advertising</title><content type='html'>Saw this post yesterday by Tatum Marketing: &lt;a href="http://www.tatummarketing.com/b2b-online-advertising-%e2%80%93-you-need-to-change-the-default-settings" rel="bookmark" title="You Need to Change the Default Settings"&gt;B2B Online Advertising – You Need to Change the Default Settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The first of these settings is an automatic opt-in to a content network.

Not sure how to do that, but &lt;a href="http://www.globalspec.com/"&gt;GlobalSpec&lt;/a&gt;'s blue header-bar and bright logo seem more authoritative.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3471387&amp;postID=9169981710906763483' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/9169981710906763483'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3471387/posts/default/9169981710906763483'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.b2blog.com/2008/07/sneak-peak-at-new-thomasnet-home-page.htm' title='Sneak peak at new ThomasNet home page'/><author><name>Dave J.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10115353782861719126</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry></feed>
