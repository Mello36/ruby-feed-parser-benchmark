I believe the campaign is a project of &lt;a href="http://www.climateprotect.org/"&gt;The Alliance for Climate Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which is run by Al Gore.&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately it is very America based, but citizens of any country can join. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2000000 people have signed up so far. Become one of us. We &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; solve the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. That sounds.. really… corny. Does it? Just do it anyway!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64397079</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64397079</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 21:13:26 -0500</pubDate><category>environmentalism</category><category>activism</category><category>link</category></item><item><title>Hopefully Obama means what he says, and america will begin to...</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="336"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CuiUZiUnr0U&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CuiUZiUnr0U&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="336" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully Obama means what he says, and america will begin to repower herself. Americans never seem to understand how important it is for them to make good decisions - once this step is taken, other countries will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a per-capita basis, America releases more greenhouse gases than &lt;a href="http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/41944/intlCO2.JPG"&gt;any other country&lt;/a&gt; (except for Luxembourg). As a much-too-powerful-for-her-own-good world leader, this is a step American needs to take, and the rest of the world is glad the next government is beginning to understand this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64394733</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64394733</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 20:54:40 -0500</pubDate><category>politics</category><category>environmentalism</category></item><item><title>"…we have the opportunity now to create jobs all across this country, in all 50 states, to..."</title><description>“…we have the opportunity now to create jobs all across this country, in all 50 states, to repower America, to redesign how we use energy, to think about how we are increasing efficiency, to make our economy stronger, make us more safe, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and make us competitive for decades to come, even as we’re saving the planet.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/em&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64393081</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64393081</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 20:43:00 -0500</pubDate><category>politics</category><category>environmentalism</category></item><item><title>Treadmills</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I think treadmills are the most wasteful and pointless invention (despite the one shown below, although i do believe that is a joke).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why waste electricity just so that you can get fit without leaving the house? It costs US$200 to run a treadmill for 3 years, a treadmill itself can cost up to $4000 ( The ELITE Pinnacle Treadmill for example) … the money wasted is ridiculous. You could just run outside, which is more interesting, more natural and not wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just build yourself a giant hamster wheel of course!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really really have to buy a treadmill you may as well buy a &lt;a href="http://www.competitiveedgeproducts.com/detail.aspx?ID=23"&gt;non-electric&lt;/a&gt; one which are soo much cheaper and of course only waste as much electricity as it takes to make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity generating treadmills would be a clever idea but you would have to do so much running before you offset the waste of resources used in producing the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64391501</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64391501</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 20:32:23 -0500</pubDate><category>complaints</category><category>environmentalism</category><category>health</category></item><item><title>eugh… this is terrible..</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="336"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XUuwEq98ByM&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XUuwEq98ByM&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="336" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;eugh… this is terrible..</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64390549</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/64390549</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 20:24:56 -0500</pubDate><category>complaints</category><category>video</category></item><item><title>The weather smiled at us as we walked along the beach at...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://media.tumblr.com/PDcviIDYqhdoxaca4UxbPB0to1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weather smiled at us as we walked along the beach at Paekakariki.

I was captured by its cover and could not resist picking it up and looking inside. As i read it i was truly amazed, so much that i bought the book later and then one for my cousin just to show her how awesome it is. The simple words have a strong story and meaning behind them. I found reading it very inspirational and i strongly recommend you look for it, maybe even buy it like i did if it strikes you in the same way. Varmints is written by Helen Ward and illustrated by Marc Craste who is a part of Studio AKA, who have made a short (24 minute) movie of the book with the same name. I posted a trailer earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a look through the other stuff that Studio AKA has created and really enjoyed it. Jojo in the Stars was my favourite video, and still is. I also posted an advertisement from a collection of 12 that Studio AKA made for Loyds TSB in England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustrations in Varmints are breathtaking. They were all made in Photoshop and tie in perfectly with the short and simple yet beautiful words. i hope that some day i will create something as creative and meaningful as this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63471635</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63471635</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2008 00:32:47 -0500</pubDate><category>environmentalism</category><category>books</category><category>art</category></item><item><title>An advert made by Studio AKA - on who’s site i found the...</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="336"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/b3xe9dSY7zM&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/b3xe9dSY7zM&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="336" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advert made by Studio AKA - on who’s &lt;a href="http://www.studioaka.co.uk/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; i found the trailer for the short Varmints film.</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63469744</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63469744</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2008 00:16:00 -0500</pubDate><category>video</category></item><item><title>Varmints Short Video!</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.studioaka.co.uk/index.php?movie=8e5a02a721eb508dd1f72fd86d55bb1c.m4v"&gt;Varmints Short Video!&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;I’m so happy! I have been waiting for this video for ages!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the trailer for a short video called Varmints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short video is based on a short book also called Varmints, written by Helen Ward and illustrated by Marc Craste, who is part of Studio AKA and directed the short film.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63462017</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63462017</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2008 23:06:00 -0500</pubDate><category>video</category><category>environmentalism</category></item><item><title>5 Reasons Why You Should Drink More Water</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently gone through a phase of drinking nothing but water. I have often realized that i am dehydrated, and now that it has become apparent that water not only hydrates you much better than other drinks but has many other benefits, i have found reason to drink it as much as i can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course i am strongly against buying bottled water, this is extremely wasteful, unnecessary and in my opinion almost unethical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should drink more water because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Water Keeps You Hydrated&lt;br/&gt;
Being hydrated has many benifits. &lt;br/&gt;
It helps to lower your blood pressure, helps the blood transport nutrients and oxygen, carries wastes out of the body, and keeps your skin in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Water helps to prevent you from overeating&lt;br/&gt;
Drinking water before and while eating fills you up so that you are less hungry. This way you eat a more appropriate amount of food. I remember reading somewhere that thirst is often mistaken for hunger and that this is one of the most common reasons for obesity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Water prevents you from drinking other drinks&lt;br/&gt;
Many people intake more sugar than is good for them, and soft drinks have a very high sugar content. Caffeine also is bad for you. Drinking more water will stop you from drinking as much of other beverages, which don’t hydrate you properly and usually contain stuff like sugar and caffeine which can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Water is Free (Or very cheap)&lt;br/&gt;
Water doesn’t cost nearly as much as other beverages, so in drinking more water instead of other liquids you save yourself money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Water has relatively small impact on environment&lt;br/&gt;
Water is very cheap to produce, and the production process has a much smaller impact on the environment than other drinks. Tap water is not shipped in bottles (obviously), and drinking tap water instead of bottled drinks stops you from wasting extraordinary amounts of plastic for very little reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, for no reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your health, for your fitness and for the environment, drink more water!!&lt;br/&gt;
Of course, over-hydration can be very bad for you (you literarily drown yourself from the inside), but  many people are frequently dehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should drink before you are thirsty, but at the same time forcing water down isn’t always good for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63460096</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63460096</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2008 22:49:00 -0500</pubDate><category>health</category><category>environmentalism</category></item><item><title>Isn’t New Zealand bush amazing?

&lt;p&gt;I wish it was easier to take pictures of it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just came back from tramping in the Orongorongos. Which was fun but short and a bit boring.&lt;br/&gt;
Been there too many times before…&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63453950</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63453950</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2008 21:57:23 -0500</pubDate><category>photo</category><category>nature</category><category>landscape</category></item><item><title>Religions</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to be religious. Because there is no logic to most common religions. There is no proof. No evidence. No need. Science explains why religions occurred. How the earth was formed. And points out that there doesn’t need to be a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing i can understand or believe though&lt;br/&gt;
is that maybe gods and religions do exist&lt;br/&gt;
and are true&lt;br/&gt;
simply because&lt;br/&gt;
people believe they are true.&lt;br/&gt;
Define reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible. The universe doesn’t really make sence. Why is there stuff. How can there be stuff? How can there be the absence of stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So- maybe what we call imaginings and beliefs are as real as reality, because reality is impossible and must somehow be false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sort of understand that. And i understand the need for religion. In the past, in the present. And believe sort of that it might be worth believing in something which you know is not true just because you know that if you believe in it you will be better off. As will society, possibly. But, with most religions this is not the case. Most wars are religious based - a lot of controversy is caused when religion and atheism clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people always have to be right? Why does it have to matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we help thoughtless practically lifeless to-be children to live when many millions of children die every day, for reasons that are all derived from overpopulation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t know where that last bit came from.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63093871</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63093871</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 19:15:00 -0500</pubDate><category>issues</category><category>religion</category></item><item><title>Duelity</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.duelity.net/"&gt;Duelity&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;This is interesting. It’s sad it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish i was religious :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more, i wish religions are true.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63088444</link><guid>http://drian42.tumblr.com/post/63088444</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 18:37:49 -0500</pubDate><category>link</category><category>religion</category></item><item><title>Stop Apple Software Update trying to install Safari all the freakin time …</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.createwebsite.info/stop-apple-software-update-trying-to-install-safari-all-the-freakin-time/"&gt;Stop Apple Software Update trying to install Safari all the freakin time …&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newzealand.tumblr.com/post/44958387/stop-apple-software-update-trying-to-install-safari-all"&gt;newzealand&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
