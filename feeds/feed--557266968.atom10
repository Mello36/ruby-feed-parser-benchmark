<li>Download and install the multi-network <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.pidgin.im');">Pidgin</a> client</li>
<li>Install Perl. On Windows (yeah, I know. It&#8217;s at work. <img src='http://extrabright.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> ), install <a href="http://www.activestate.com/downloads/index.mhtml" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.activestate.com');">Active Perl</a> version 5.8.8.X. Don&#8217;t take the last one, the 5.10.0, as Pidgin does not support it yet.</li>
<li>Install the Package XML:XPath, either using the CPAN console (install XML:XPath) or using the package manager of Active Perl.</li>
<li>Restart Pidgin and check that Perl is enabled. (Help -> About -> at the bottom of the page, you should see &#8216;Perl: Enabled&#8217;).</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-twitterstatus/wiki/Installation" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/code.google.com');">twitter plugin</a> and put it in the plugin folder of Pidgin. (For instance on Windows in &#8216;C:\Program Files\Pidgin\plugins&#8217;)</li>
<li>Configure the plug-in and enjoy!</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I published some time ago a news regarding reducing the power consumption of my home server to 53 W. There was some open issues like how to reduce the consumption further.</p>
<p>Regarding this, I finally simply decided to switch off the server automatically every night using a Cron job. This is an elegant solution, as I am not hosting anything on this home server, other than stuffs I am using at home. Everything else is on my dedicated server.</p>
<p>This solution has the following two advantages:</p>
<li> It is very effective: I just need to switch on the server when I need it. It will get switched off automatically after a while. Hence the server is off most of the time.</li>
<li> It is handy: I don’t need to remember to log on into it just before leaving home. Just switching on the server when I need it, is fully OK for me.</li>
<p>What I can still improve:</p>
<li>Getting wake-on-lan working. That way I would not even need to switch it on. This would be really cool. I could even configure my WIFI access point to send automatically a wake-on-lan packet to the server, whenever it is accessed for the first time after a long inactivity period. I would just have a longer latency the first time I am accessing the server, whenever it gets waken up.</li>
<p>Will check this out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something I wanted to do since ages. My wireless router WRT54GL running the Tomato firmware has a button on the front, which can be used to toggle WIFI on and off. The router has also a rather visible LED indicator, behind the button, that is unfortunately not used to show the WIFI status. (Originally, the wifi status is just shown by a tiny LED, that is just visible when watching closely the device).</p>
<p>It’s easy to fix that. Using the web interface, go to the ‘Administration’ > ‘Buttons / LED’ page. Replace the custom script by the following code:</p>
<p><code><br />
# status: 1: wifi on, 0: wifi off<br />
status=$(wl -a eth1 dump | grep associated | cut -d " " -f 2);<br />
# toggle wifi &#038; amber led<br />
wl -a eth1 $([ $status -eq 0 ] &#038;&#038; echo up || echo down)<br />
led amber $([ $status -eq 0 ] &#038;&#038; echo on || echo off)<br />
</code></p>
<p>Then change the setting for ‘0 - 2 Seconds’ to ‘Run Custom Script’. That’s it. Now when we press the button, the wireless is toggled and the LED switches itself accordingly.</p>
<p>Tested with Tomato 1.19.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the free newspaper “news” of today (Zurich, Switzerland) page 15, the computer-science Professor Kieron O’Hara, which is concerned about the loss of privacy in the internet age, is advising the editor in the interview to “google regularly one’s name, phone number and credit card number”, to see if this information is to be found somewhere on the net. OMG. I am wondering where this crap comes from. Either is this professor as intelligent as my banana tree, or the editor writing this did the interview in Esperanto, which neither of the two are understanding.</p>
<p>Why is it a bad idea to google one’s credit card number? Just in case you don’t know.</p>
<li> The connexion to the google server is not encrypted. So anybody evesdropping on the path to it could get the information (e.g. at your local provider or your neighbour that just hacked your weak WEP wireless encryption).</li>
<li> There is no guarantee whatsoever about what google is gonna do about the submitted queries. At best it will be stored in one of their database in clear text.</li>
<li> At worst it will appear on a big screen inside the reception room in a google office, on the live query list.</li>
