<h3>Satish Talim - Ruby Evangelist and Facilitator</h3>
<p>Satish Talim is an established software development expert (over 30 years of experience in the industry!) based in Pune, India. He's most recognized in the Ruby community for his ongoing work with his <a href="http://rubylearning.com/">RubyLearning</a> group of sites. He's also built up a strong following on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/IndianGuru">@IndianGuru</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2006, Satish - along with a fast growing group of volunteers - has helped thousands of people (many of who first came into the Ruby world in 2008) in over 100 countries to learn Ruby. Tomorrow he starts <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/10/30/ruby-and-shoes-programming-a-new-course/">his latest class</a> - based around Why The Lucky Stiff's Shoes system. His <a href="http://www.rubylearning.org/class/">class list</a> shows that in this January to March 2008 class there were over 2200 participants! For this reason alone, Satish easily walks away with Ruby Inside's commendation for <strong>top Ruby teacher in 2008.</strong></p>
<p>As well as his teaching efforts, Satish has also become a popular blogger in the Ruby world on the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/">Ruby Learning Blog</a>. He's recently published interviews with Ruby and Rails luminaries including <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/09/23/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-jamie-van-dyke/">Jamie van Dyke</a>, <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/09/30/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-james-edward-gray-ii/">James Edward Gray II</a>, <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/11/11/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-jonathan-conway/">Jonathan Conway</a>, <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/02/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-ezra-zygmuntowicz/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> and <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/10/07/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-dr-nic-williams/">Dr. Nic Williams</a>. All worth reading!</p>
<h3>A Few Questions..</h3>
<p><strong>How (and when) did you find your way into Ruby?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After being with Java since its beta days, my interest in Ruby was aroused after I read an article <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/11/16/ruby-the-rival.html">Ruby the Rival</a> in November 2005. I decided to learn Ruby myself and started making my Ruby Notes for <a href="http://rubylearning.com/">my site, RubyLearning.com</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How have your Ruby &amp; Rails related projects progressed in 2008?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started my free, <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">online Ruby teaching site</a> in January 2008 and today it has over 5600 participants who have either learned Ruby or are in the process of learning Ruby with me. The experience has been very positive and fulfilling. I've also been promoting Ruby in India since 2006 with my <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/puneruby/">PuneRuby User Group</a>. I also managed to convince the the University of Pune to introduce Ruby as a full time paper in their computer science course from Jan. 2009.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">RubyLearning.org</a> I am able to give Ruby exposure to people across the globe (there are currently students registered from over 140 countries) - we have people from far-flung places where no trainers (leave alone <em>Ruby</em> trainers) are available - my site facilitates that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What plans do you have for 2009?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To introduce more new, free or low-cost courses in Ruby and related areas. Beginning 2009, new courses on TDD, Merb etc. are in the offing.</p>

<p>Back in the real world, Ruby has been doing just fine. Ruby 1.9.1 is due for final release any time soon, a ton of awesome libraries and technologies have been released or previewed, and Ruby (and Rails <em>and</em> Merb) powered Web apps have continued to flourish. This isn't because of any significant strides in the development of Ruby itself, but due to an ongoing effort by new and old Rubyists alike to keep making things better (and, in some cases, to put money in their own pocket - but who doesn't want to do that?)</p>
<h3>Launching the Ruby Top 10 of 2008!</h3>
<p>To celebrate just <em>some</em> of the people who've been working hard in the Ruby world in 2008 (or projects or companies), Ruby Inside is running a series of posts highlighting "top" Rubyists or Ruby achievements in several areas. <strong>The series starts tomorrow with "Top Teacher" and runs till the end of the month / year.</strong></p>
<p>As each post goes up, <strong>this post will be updated with links</strong> to them, but for now - the categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/rubys-top-teacher-in-2008-satish-talim-1396.html">Top Teacher - Satish Talim</a><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Top Presentation</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Hitter</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Blogger</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Tool</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Evangelist</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Implementation</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Gem</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Team</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
<li><strong>Top Event</strong> <em>(winner unannounced)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So now you're saying <em>"You could thank them in a single post!"</em> right? Noooo.. they're all going to be profiled in posts spanning from now till the end of the year. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Alternatively, get into the comments right now and <strong>say who/what</strong> <em><strong>you</strong></em> <strong>think should come top of these categories</strong>. It won't change the ultimate result, but it'll be interesting to see a wide range of opinions.</p>
<h3>Want to feel some love right <em>now</em>?</h3>
<p>If you're really anxious to find out who loves who, check out <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/items/1248">this 38 comment thread on RubyFlow</a> where people made some nominations for this top 10. Ultimately I chose entirely based upon my own opinion, though only two of the top 10 were <em>not</em> mentioned there.. so it's well worth reading.</p>

<p>Back in December 2007, Antonio Cangiano presented <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/12/03/the-great-ruby-shootout/">The Great Ruby Shootout</a>, a large set of benchmarks of then-current Ruby implementations (Ruby 1.8.5, YARV - early Ruby 1.9, JRuby, Ruby.NET, Rubinius, XRuby, and Cardinal). Even then, despite Ruby 1.9's infancy and experimental nature, Ruby 1.9 came out as about three times faster than Ruby 1.8.5 - while other implementations were barely faster than 1.8.5.</p>
<h3>Now.. for 2008: Ruby 1.9.1 is the winner..!</h3>
<p>Now Antonio has put together <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/12/09/the-great-ruby-shootout-december-2008/">an all new December 2008 Great Ruby Shootout!</a> There's a lot of reading to do but the results are very exciting. JRuby's performance has come along in leaps and bounds and Ruby 1.9.1 is around <em>five</em> times faster than Ruby 1.8.7. Phusion's <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a> (basically an amended fork of 1.8.6) also comes in at a surprising two-times faster than 1.8.7! Remember that Antonio's benchmarks are by no means representative of how <em>your</em> application might be using Ruby, but these numbers are extremely encouraging.</p>
<p>As well as comparing JRuby, Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.1, Rubinius and REE, separate benchmarks were run for Maglev, MacRuby and IronRuby - all still reasonably experimental implementations. Maglev worked out at about twice the speed of 1.8 (though some operations were <em>far</em> slower), MacRuby offered performance equivalent to 1.8 (at this point), and IronRuby was a little slower due to its focus on .NET integration and matching the Ruby spec more closely (versus working on performance and optimizations). Make sure to <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/12/09/the-great-ruby-shootout-december-2008/">head over to the article for the full results</a>.</p>
<p>Antonio sums it up pretty well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall I think these are great results. Ruby 1.8 (MRI), with its slowness and memory leaks, belongs to the past. It’s time for the community to move forward and on to something better and faster - and we don’t lack interesting alternatives to do so at this stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Could Ruby 1.9.1 be about to beat Python, Perl or PHP?</h3>
<p>Now all we need is for Ruby 1.9.1 to reach final release and to see how it stacks up on the Alioth Shootout. Currently Ruby 1.8 is at the very bottom and an earlyish build of Ruby 1.9 is 9th from bottom just below Python, Perl and PHP. If the performance of Ruby 1.9 can go from 28 times slower than compiled C++ to just 18 times slower, Ruby will leapfrog these three strong competitors and one of the biggest criticisms of Ruby will become extinct.</p>
<p><em>(As an aside - is anyone familiar enough with the Alioth Shootout to run the benchmarks for the latest Ruby 1.9.1 build to see how it compares so far?)</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rrunx.png" width="183" height="123" alt="rrunx.png" style="float:left; margin-right:12px; margin-bottom:12px;" />It was a few months ago that <a href="http://www.rubysophic.com/">Rubysophic</a> - a Bay Area startup working on products relating to Ruby diagnostics - came quietly into the Ruby scene, launching their first product, <a href="http://www.rubysophic.com/products/RubyRun/">RubyRun Community Edition</a>, a free, standalone application-performance diagnostic tool. While the most obvious use is with Rails applications, RubyRun works on any Ruby code (within reason) though it's primarily suited to Web applications.</p>
<p>I spoke with a few developers at Rubysophic recently to find out more about RubyRun and why they were offering it for free. It turns out that their team mostly comes from the J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) world (from companies including HP, IBM, and Cisco) and they wanted to release a suite of enterprise-quality diagnostics tools and services for the Ruby world. It seems that their ultimate plan is to offer a holistic range of services - not just tools like RubyRun but direct collaboration on performance issues.</p>
<h3>Diagnostics, Not Monitoring?</h3>
<p>The sort of data that RubyRun provides might remind you of <a href="http://www.newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>'s RPM product (it certainly did for me when I tried it out!) or those from <a href="http://www.fiveruns.com/">FiveRuns</a>, but the Rubysophic guys wanted to stress that they're "not a monitoring company" and are entirely devoted to "diagnostics." They told me that RubyRun is suited more to when you want to track down a problem and fix it, rather than as a permanent addition to your app.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rrtrace.png" width="567" height="261" alt="rrtrace.png" style="border:1px #000000 solid;" /></p>
<p>Upon playing with the tool, I got to see some rather in-depth "traces" of what my Rails applications were doing. It wasn't the sort of information I'd want to see all the time, but for fixing specific performance issues, it was incredibly detailed.</p>
<h3>Standalone, No Phoning Home</h3>
<p>I also noted another key difference between RubyRun and other monitoring tools (useful though they are) was that RubyRun runs standalone. It doesn't talk to a server. Everything is published locally into HTML reports - performance summary reports, detailed reports, and process traces. Further, the latency is in the single milliseconds range per request, so even though it's not designed for permanent use, it doesn't hurt too much on minor applications.</p>
<p>After getting a tour from the Rubysophic guys, I realized that despite getting the impression RubyRun was competing with the services offered by New Relic and Five Runs, it's not. RubyRun is a very direct tool that you can call on to look into both performance <em>and</em> code problems primarily during the <em>development</em> stage. It gives you information down the object level - how many objects of each class are currently instantiated, etc - and down to every single step made in a single request.</p>
<p>For free, it's a good tool. I imagine Rubysophic will be offering more commercial-level services in the future, perhaps even liaising with people who need problems diagnosed, but for now RubyRun is free and definitely worth playing with if you're developing applications where you want deep traces and instant HTML reports.</p>
<p>For more information check out <a href="http://www.rubysophic.com/products/RubyRun/">the official product page</a>, the <a href="http://www.rubysophic.com/download/files/rubyrun-0.9.8.htm">gargantuan and highly detailed user guide</a>, or <a href="http://www.rubysophic.com/download/">download it</a>. <em>(They won't like me for saying this, but if you don't want to give your details, check out</em> <a href="http://www.rubysophic.com/download/files/README.txt"><em>the quick start guide</em></a> <em>to see how to install it as a gem ;-))</em></p>
<p><em>(Disclaimer: Rubysophic is a sponsor of Ruby Inside. While I was unaware of RubyRun before this, I was impressed that they were offering a free, no-strings-attached product and thought it deserved highlighting. There are no sponsor-influenced posts on this site - except the monthly Thanks To Our Sponsors posts - and I believe RubyRun is a particularly interesting offering in any case. If you have similarly community beneficial products and services that could be featured in a similar way, do get in touch!)</em></p>

<p>In his <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/12/05/my-rubygems-development-tools-and-workflow/">explanatory blog post</a>, Nic also ponders Perl's <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> (a gigantic archive of Perl modules) and the module installation process it offers. When you install a module, the tests for the module are run in real time immediately. If they fail, the module isn't installed into its final location. Nic discovered you can do this with RubyGems by adding the <em>--test</em> option, but it would be nice if it were a standard operation as it could clear up ambiguity over whether a library is fully functioning or not before you try to use it.</p>
<p>If you want to see a different approach, Ryan Bates has recorded <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/135-making-a-gem">a "how to make a gem"</a> screencast.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Dr Nic <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/iphone-development-podcast-2-dr-nic-williams/">was recently interviewed</a> on the <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/">Mobile Orchard</a> podcast. Mobile Orchard is essentially the Ruby Inside of the iPhone developer world, and Nic spoke about getting Ruby onto the iPhone, unit testing Objective C from Ruby, and other great stuff.</p>

<p>One of the coolest features of RubyConf in 31 Minutes is that it's hosted on Viddler, which has allowed Gregg to tag and comment on the video so that you can see who's speaking and how to watch their full presentation as you're watching them give the summary!</p>
<p>If you want to see the <em>full</em> presentation videos, you can, thanks to Confreaks who <a href="http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/">filmed most of the presentations given</a>. Approximately half of the videos are up so far (I count 35). This isn't the time or place to go through them <em>all</em> but some particular highlights are:</p>

<p>Don't expect to see the talk <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles</a> was meant to be giving though, as he was unfairly banned for "inciting violence" by posting a tongue-in-cheek blog post - if you want see a suggestion of the greatness that would have prevailed, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/archaeopteryx-bowkett">watch his excellent RubyFringe presentation instead</a>.</p>

It also has its own intermediate representation language that's architecture independent and the instruction sets and typing system available are similarly language independent. In theory, if you want to build your own programming language <em>and</em> a compiler for it, LLVM will get you most of the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://llvmruby.org/">llvmruby</a> is an attempt to bring LLVM's power into the grasp of Rubyists. LLVM is typically used from C++, but llvmruby lets you use the LLVM compiler infrastructure directly from the Ruby interpreter. It's still pretty new and only a subset of LLVM is currently usable, but it's under semi-active development by Tom Bagby, and as well as <a href="http://llvmruby.org/wordpress-llvmruby/">a blog</a>, there's also <a href="http://github.com/tombagby/llvmruby/tree/master">a Github repository</a> you can check out.</p>
<p>On the topic of LLVM, Miura Hideki has developed <a href="http://github.com/miura1729/yarv2llvm/tree/master">YARV2LLVM</a>, a YARV (Ruby 1.9's VM) to LLVM translator. While it currently only accepts a tiny subset of Ruby, it's interesting because it uses LLVM's power to compiler YARV into very fast native code. The page is in Japanese, but <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/miura1729/20081012/1223785541">one of Miura's early benchmarks</a> is not hard to decipher.</p>
