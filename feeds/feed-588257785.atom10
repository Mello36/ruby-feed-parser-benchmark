<p>The 19-year-old Forever singer is the latest celeb to join the ‘Body by Milk’ campaign created to encourage teens to drink three glasses of lowfat or fat free milk every day, eat right and be active to stay lean and healthy.</p>
<p>The ad copy reads, “Chris Brown feat. Milk. Another great collaboration? Milk. Some studies suggest that teens who drink milk tend to be leaner and the protein helps build muscle. So eat right, exercise and drink lowfat or fat free milk. Talk about a smooth move.” The ad debuts in Rolling Stone on December 12, 2008.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLEX::</strong> So Sean Kingston was originally on your joint “Yamaha Mama,” and now it seems like Chris Brown has replaced him. Why the switch?</p>
<p><strong>SOULJA BOY:</strong> Chris Brown wrote the song. Originally, Chris Brown and I did the song together. And then they sent it to Sean in some kind of way, and Sean did his verse on it. Basically there are two versions. The Sean Kingston [version] wasn’t supposed to be leaked, but I think somebody from the label or somebody from the studio leaked the record and it was all over the Internet. Then the Chris Brown version was released too. Now, we have two different records all over the Internet. The one on the album is the one featuring Sean Kingston. </p>

<p>Another day, another rumor. Have you heard the one about Chris Brown and David Archuleta possibly touring together? Say it isn&#8217;t so, for the love of &#8230;</p>
<p>Back to CB &#038; Ri-Ri though. New rumors have surfaced online that the two have been spotted in Virgina spending some QT (quality time - for those who are a bit behind the curve today), and word is they&#8217;ve even been meeting with ~real estate agents~! Yeah, I&#8217;m not buying into it yet either. If they&#8217;re so visible, where are the pictures? Show me a picture, and then I&#8217;ll consider these new reports.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really want to bother posting the entire thing. You can read it <a href="http://24hourhiphop.com/hip+hop+Rumors/Chris+Brown+And+Rihanna+Shacking+Up%3F/3649">here</a> if you have nothing better to do.</p>

If you&#8217;ll be in e-attendance <a href="mailto:cbwdominique@gmail.com">e-mail me</a> before the chat begins.

INSTRUCTIONS/INFO:<br />

- The chat is live and Chris will be on camera (Please have your volume ON in order to participate)<br />
- Absolutely no profanity, the chat will be monitored.<br />

- You DO NOT have to be a member of kytetv to participate, you may chat as a guest.</p>
<p>Hmm. Now I really wish I could join the chat too! <img src='http://www.chrisbrownweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

To me, this is <strong>EPIC</strong>! I love to see Chris doing stuff that is good for other people. It shows he has not forgotten his roots and is not letting his celebrity go to waste. <a href="http://www.clothesoffourback.org/product_info.php?products_id=1859" target="_blank">Clothes Off Our Back</a> currently has a bowl signed by Chris Brown up for auction (ending December 12th), in effort to support <strong>Feeding America</strong> and their “Fill a Bowl, Feed America”. Head on over to their site and place your bids!</p>
<blockquote><p>Own the bowl signed by recording star Chris Brown.  Mr. Brown signed the bowl at the American Music Awards to support Feeding America and their “Fill a Bowl, Feed America” campaign.</p>
<p>Remember that $1 provides 16 meals for a child.  Proceeds from the auction benefit Feeding America.  Special thanks to Dick Clark Productions, the American Music Awards and the Official Silver Spoon Gifting Lounge for their support.
</p></blockquote>

Any mere mention of the name Chris Brown from the show’s hosts sent the young, female and generally besotted audience into screaming fits. Brown’s headlining set was, in kind, less a performance of music than a celebration of Chris Brown-ness, a flaming nebula of charisma that made whatever snippet of song he tackled largely beside the point. Brown is probably the best dancer in pop music today (a hugely underrated skill), and he turned over a big portion of his set to a gang of nimble kids who joined him in several dance-offs that surely left phantom pains in the joints of all adults in the room. Hits like “No Air” and “Kiss Kiss” were perfectly competent windows-down confections, but each were subsumed in the sheer wattage of Brown’s star power. So goes Jingle Ball as a whole &#8212; a good song will get you on the radio, but you have to rise above the playlist to stay there.</p>

<p>This is clearly a demo (unfinished track) if you listen to it, just as the other tracks that have been leaking out for months. </p>
<p>If an abundance of tracks begin to leak we will be removing all songs from Chris Brown Web and will begin to alert his management of the leaks. I am pretty sure that Jive will begin to pursue those who offer the leaks for download, hence why we do not allow them to be downloaded on Chris Brown Web. You may stream them as long as they&#8217;re available, though.</p>

<p>In a slightly disappointing turn for us Chris Brown fans last night, he scored 2 nominations for the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. Not to say I am not happy for him, because believe me - it&#8217;s still an honor, it&#8217;s just expected a different turn out. It is clear to anyone who has a brain that Chris Brown has been everywhere for the past two years and he is not slowing down any time soon. I agree with some fans that have left comments on the site that &#8220;With You&#8221; should have been nominated as well as his album &#8220;Exclusive&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know. The Grammy Awards are just not what they used to be. Hopefully the broadcast is amazing and something fresh. It&#8217;s been pretty stiff lately.</p>
<p>Anyway, the nominations:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance:</span><br />
Eric Benét - &#8220;You&#8217;re The Only One&#8221;<br />
*<strong>Chris Brown - &#8220;Take You Down&#8221;</strong><br />
Ne-Yo - &#8220;Miss Independent&#8221;<br />
Trey Songz - &#8220;Can&#8217;t Help But Wait&#8221;<br />
Usher - &#8220;Here I Stand&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals:</span><br />
Alicia Keys and John Mayer - “Lessons Learned”<br />
Madonna, Justin Timberlake and Timbaland - “Four Minutes”<br />
Robert Plant and Allison Krauss - “Rich Woman”<br />
Rihanna and Maroon 5 - “If I Never See Your Face Again”<br />
*<strong>Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown - “No Air”</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to put your two cents in.</p>

In an era where awards shows are as commonplace as reality shows, even the top-tier events are finding it hard to stand out.</p>
<p>So the Recording Academy is trying something different when it announces its nominees for its upcoming Grammys. Instead of its traditional morning roll call of nominee names at a staid press conference, top nominees will be revealed during a prime-time concert special to air live Wednesday on CBS.</p>
<p>Among the performers are Mariah Carey, John Mayer and Taylor Swift — a potential nominee.</p>
<p>Read the full story <a href="http://cbs4.com/national/grammy.award.nominations.2.878730.html">here.</a> </p>
<p>Make sure you tune in tonight at 9PM EST. We know Chris will get some nominations this year.<br />
<strong>It&#8217;s time to win his first Grammy!</strong></p>

A photographer is looking for a massive payday from Rihanna and Chris Brown, after he says he was beaten and robbed for snapping a photo of the young couple in May.</p>
<p>Luis Santana just filed a $1 million lawsuit in Florida &#8212; claiming his $3,000 camera was stolen from him after being form-tackled outside Brown&#8217;s 19th birthday party at the Vintage Ultra Lounge in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Luis says bodyguards for RiRi, Brown and the Lounge attacked him for taking a photo of the couple through their open limo window, according to <strong><a href="http://blogs.tampabay.com/breakingnews/2008/12/tbt-photographe.html">The St. Petersburg Times</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The reason Santana&#8217;s suing for such a large amount &#8212; he says the photo would have made a killing since the two lovebirds weren&#8217;t officially dating, and it showed them together.</p>

A long, long time ago, say, in 2001, when a massive pop band like &#8216;NSYNC released an album like Celebrity, you could count on them to top the charts across the board. But these days, things are more democratic. No one seems to know how to measure who the real #1 artist is, so everyone gets to take home a shiny trophy — just like pee-wee soccer!</p>
<p>The deluge of year-end charts has begun, and the winners are all over the map. They include mild-mannered Chris Brown — whose videos and interviews were reportedly seen 43 million times on the on-demand Music Choice TV service. Brown was honored at the first Most Demanded Awards show, which, like his videos, was available on-demand for free beginning on Monday, according to The Associated Press. Music Choice executive Damon Williams said that teenage girls were primarily responsible for Brown&#8217;s victory over such runners-up as the Jonas Brothers and Lil Wayne.<span id="more-1793"></span></p>
<p>On iTunes, Coldplay took the top prize, as Viva la Vida was dubbed the most downloaded album of the year, with more than 500,000 digital copies sold since June, the AP reported. Coldplay were followed on the iTunes album list by Jack Johnson&#8217;s Sleep Through the Static, the soundtrack to &#8220;Juno,&#8221; Wayne&#8217;s Tha Carter III and Sara Bareilles&#8217; Little Voice. The top-selling single on iTunes this year was Leona Lewis&#8217; &#8220;Bleeding Love,&#8221; which sold 3.2 million digital copies, according to her label. iTunes said the second most downloaded single was the title track to Coldplay&#8217;s album, followed by Flo Rida&#8217;s &#8220;Low&#8221; and Katy Perry&#8217;s &#8220;I Kissed a Girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over at Yahoo! Music, Alicia Keys got a shiny crown, thanks to her &#8220;No One&#8221; video, which was the #1 most viewed video on the service this year. According to AbsolutePunk.net, the diva-tastic list also includes a #2 slot for Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;Touch My Body&#8221; clip, followed by Lewis&#8217; &#8220;Bleeding Love,&#8221; Rihanna&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop the Music,&#8221; Jordin Sparks&#8217; &#8220;No Air&#8221; and Wayne&#8217;s &#8220;Lollipop.&#8221; Oh, and that pesky Sara Bareilles snuck in at #9 with &#8220;Love Song.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the end, no matter what calamities, joys or economic disasters are going on in any given year, you can count on one person rising above the din to unite us all. No, not Barack Obama (he&#8217;s stuck at #3). For the seventh time in eight years, Britney Spears topped the list of Yahoo!&#8217;s most popular search topics. Once again, World Wrestling Entertainment had to take a backseat to Brit, who sat atop a list that also included Miley Cyrus (#4), the enduringly popular MMORPG RuneScape (#5), Jessica Alba (#6), the manga and anime series Naruto (#7), Lindsay Lohan (#8), Angelina Jolie (#9) and something called &#8220;American Idol.&#8221;</p>

Only at <strong>Chris Brown Web</strong> can you get word straight from the source. I was in contact with Ms. Mary from TJHC, part of Chris&#8217; management, and asked her a few general questions about Chris&#8217; activity in 2009 such as &#8220;Who is the supporting act for the tour?&#8221; and &#8220;What is the tour in support of?&#8221; and here&#8217;s what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As of now, we have just settled today, the exact details of the tour. It will bounce off of The Forever Edition of Exclusive. Not for sure of the opening [act] as of now.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, with those few words we now have a little bit of information to hold us over until an official announcement as to who will be touring with Chris Brown in 2009 is made.</p>

It&#8217;s official. Chris Brown is officially the sh*t! Why? He freakin&#8217; has Madison Square Garden on his side. Yes, I said Madison Square Garden. The world&#8217;s most famous venue &#8212; EVER! OMG! I have been to NYC a few times, but I haven&#8217;t been to ~The Garden~. I so want to see a concert there! MSG, wanna be nice and hook me up? LOL! Just kidding. No, but really. Please? <img src='http://www.chrisbrownweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> lol</p>
<p>Whoa. Way off track. You know I can do that from time to time&#8230;.so back to Chris Brown!</p>
<p>Now, if you missed <a href="http://www.chrisbrownweb.com/index.php/2008/11/26/z100-jingle-ball-2008-reminder/" target="_blank">this post</a>, then you&#8217;re clearly slacking on your CB fan game. Step it up! I&#8217;ll remind you one more time, however. Chris Brown is going to be performing at Z100&#8217;s Jingle Ball 2008 on <strong>Decebmer 12, 2008</strong>! Yes, in less than two weeks! You NYC fans better be freakin&#8217; out and so damn excited to see him, or else I&#8217;m going to be disappointed. </p>
<p>Jane from MSG sent me an e-mail with a bit of information that she&#8217;d like to share with you guys:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;We’ve added a new Chris Brown gallery that you and your readers may be interested in checking out:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msg.com/themonitor/2008/12/01/chris-brown-photo-gallery-the-12-days-of-jingle-ball/ " target="_blank">The Monitor - Chris Brown Photo Gallery: The 12 Days of Jingle  Ball</a></p>
<p>Chris Brown will be performing here at Madison Square Garden on December 12 for Z100’s Jingle Ball, and he’s our top man today in our 12 Days of Jingle Ball Countdown. We will also have Chris Brown photos and Fan Cam videos after the show.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there you have it. Jane knows best.</p>
