			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" src="http://theobamapound.com/wp-content/uploads/ahmadinejad.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="261" />Iran&#8217;s parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran&#8217;s development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Ahmadinejad on Thursday outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change. Ali Larijani said on Saturday Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,&#8221; Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency. What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran&#8217;s nuclear program which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>Larijani said U.S. behavior toward Iran &#8220;will not change so simply,&#8221; but that Obama&#8217;s election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.</p>
<p>He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but &#8220;you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic (from reaching its goals in the nuclear field),&#8221; according to the news agency.</p>
<p>Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not yet in office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we&#8217;ve got to think it through,&#8221; Obama told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president and I won&#8217;t be until January 20th.&#8221;<br />
Don&#8217;t Miss</p>
<p>Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama &#8212; the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the U.S.</p>
<p>Ahmadinejad said Tehran &#8220;welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts,&#8221; according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.</p>
<p>Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly, and have been further strained in recent years over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>Tehran insists the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran&#8217;s refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President-elect Barack Obama has told Polish President Lech Kaczynski that he intends to continue plans for a missile shield in eastern Europe, the Polish president&#8217;s office said on its Web site Saturday.</p>
<p>Obama spoke of his plans during a phone conversation with Kaczynski, the office said. During the call, Obama said he hoped for continued military and political cooperation between the United States and Poland and hoped to meet with Kaczynski soon, according to the report.</p>
<p>Moscow is infuriated by U.S. plans for the missile-defense installation, which includes basing missile interceptors in Poland. The interceptor rockets would be linked to an air-defense radar system in the Czech Republic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Obama called Nancy Reagan on Friday to apologize for joking that she held <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9ance">seances</a> in the White House. At a news conference in Chicago, Obama said he had spoken with all the living presidents as he prepares to take office in January. Then he smiled and said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about doing any seances.&#8221;Â  The 87-year-old former first lady had consulted with astrologers during her husband&#8217;s presidency. But she did not hold conversations with the dead.</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said the president-elect later called Mrs. Reagan &#8220;to apologize for the careless and offhanded remark.&#8221; She said Obama &#8220;expressed his admiration and affection for Mrs. Reagan that so many Americans share, and they had a warm conversation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.</p>
<p>I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain. He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he&#8217;s fought even longer and harder for the country he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation&#8217;s promise in the months ahead.</p>
<p>I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation&#8217;s next First Lady, Michelle Obama. Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that&#8217;s coming with us to the White House. And while she&#8217;s no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.</p>
<p>To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you&#8217;ve sacrificed to get it done.</p>
<p>But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to it belongs to you.</p>
<p>I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn&#8217;t start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.</p>
<p>It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people<br />
who rejected the myth of their generation&#8217;s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory.</p>
<p>I know you didn&#8217;t do this just to win an election and I know you didn&#8217;t do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime, two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.</p>
<p>Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they&#8217;ll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor&#8217;s bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.</p>
<p>The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you we as a people will get there.</p>
<p>There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won&#8217;t agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can&#8217;t solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way<br />
it&#8217;s been done in America for 221 years block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.</p>
<p>What began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek it is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It cannot happen without you.</p>
<p>So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it&#8217;s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.</p>
<p>Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that have poisoned our politics for so long. Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, &#8216;We are not enemies, but friends though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.&#8217; And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president too.</p>
<p>And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security we support you. And to all those who have wondered if America&#8217;s beacon still burns as bright tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.</p>
<p>For that is the true genius of America that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.</p>
<p>This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that&#8217;s on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She&#8217;s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing &#8212; Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.</p>
<p>She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn&#8217;t vote for two reasons because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.</p>
<p>And tonight, I think about all that she&#8217;s seen throughout her century in America the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can&#8217;t, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.</p>
<p>At a time when women&#8217;s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can.</p>
<p>When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can.</p>
<p>When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved.<br />
Yes we can.</p>
<p>She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that &#8216;We Shall Overcome.&#8217; Yes we can.</p>
<p>A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes we can.</p>
<p>America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?</p>
<p>This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can&#8217;t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: &#8220;Yes we can. Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This election is and will be the most covered Presidential Election in the 20th century. With President-Elect Barack Obama getting ready to move into the power transition phase, we sit back and reflect on which news network was most outstanding and unbiased in the Election Coverage. Without a doubt, CNN emerges as not only the most technological savvy network but only has the best team of policatical analysts covering the campaign trails down to election day.</p>
<p>CNN has once again shown that its the news network that can blend technology into news first introducing the touchscreen &#8220;magic wall&#8221; used ever so often in forecasting how the Electoral College Map was moving. Last night, we saw for the first time the use of holograms to project various off-site news anchors in front of Wolf Blitzer. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/04/forget-the-magic-wall-cnn-now-has-holograms/">Tech writers like Michael Arrington of Techcrunch.com all preferred CNN because of the use of the hologram technology</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cnnvirtualjessicayellin2.jpg" alt="" width="562" height="379" /></p>
<p>The network has created green-screen virtual-set environments that will be set up in mobile trailers outside the Obama and McCain headquarters and will use a mix of mechanical and infrared camera-tracking technology to create a realistic holographic image of the correspondent on the floor of the âSituation Roomâ set in New York. The field correspondents will have a 37â plasma monitor showing a return feed of the âSituation Roomâ set with Blitzer to give them a frame of reference.</p>
<p>This is truly amazing and in many sense, it almost feel like I was watching Star Wars but only it&#8217;s real. <a href="http://theobamapound.com/2008/10/is-foxnews-really-fair-and-balance/">We&#8217;ve spoken about FoxNews and their claim of &#8220;Fair and Balance&#8221; in their election coverage</a>. It&#8217;s time to change that dial to CNN if you are still on FoxNews.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span>TheObamaPound.com was inspired by President-Elec Obama on that historical day that he won the Democratic nomination for the Democratic Party. In fact, that day, June 6th 2008, marks the registration of our blog and that day also marks the historical moment in US history. Obama celebrated his victory on national television with a <a href="http://theobamapound.com/2008/06/the-obama-pound-an-historical-event/">fist bump with Michelle Obama that we proudly called The Obama Pound</a>!</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span>At the time of writing, President-Elec Obama is projected to win Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia (CNN thinks it too close to call but we believe President Obama will take Virginia). These are key battle ground states that McCain has high hopes and spent a lot of time campaigning. If McCain does not secure these states, it is almost impossible for him to secure the 270 electoral votes given the history that the West Coast of the country votes. Could the race be over before we even see the West Coast results? It&#8217;s very likely. As we have <a href="http://theobamapound.com/2008/10/does-your-vote-matter-anymore/">said before that that some votes will really not matter</a> and that the elected president could be project as early as 9pm EST.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span>As we watch in anticipation for the moment when President Obama gets the 270 electoral vote, will we once again witness <a href="http://theobamapound.com">the Obama Pound</a>? We&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see. Good night Americans! And congratulations to President Obama.</span></strong></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: With the<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/05/election.president/index.html"> President-Elect Barack Obama</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/04/obama-wins-in-total-rout/">winning the election</a>, we look in retrospective on why John McCain lost the election.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/POLITICS/11/05/election.president/t1wide.obama4.ap.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>With the election upon us in a matter of hours, we will be bold here and called this early. As posted in our electoral predictions, we think Obama will win the election with as many as 355 to 183. With such a victory, it will definitely tone down the right wing hardcores because this will show that the country is no longer divided but united.</p>
<p>With that said, so why did John McCain lost? As we had mentioned in our earlier opinion piece, John McCain took a huge risk in choosing Sarah Palin as his choice for VP. Not only did not go as his plan with Sarah Palin, it&#8217;s actually enough to persuade many Republican voters to go Democratic. But even though Sarah Palin is not the entire reason that McCain lost, it was a huge factor.</p>
<p>The reason that McCain lost is simply - he ran like a politician and not like a presidential candidate. If only someone like Sarah Palin can energize his campaign, that just goes to show like refreshing he has been to the Republican party. McCain used every single tip in &#8220;<a href="http://adventurebooks.newsvine.com/_news/2008/09/17/1876020-the-idiots-guide-to-republican-economics-ten-thousand-foreclosures-a-day-and-why-our-economy-is-the-only-issue-">The Complete Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Campaigning like a Republican</a>&#8220;. By playing up on fear and negativity, this is not what the country is looking for. The fact that most American want is CHANGE, it&#8217;s almost suicidal to take the traditional Republican campaign roots - negative ads, not addressing the issues at hand, robocalls, poorly managed campaign and finally choosing a VP that just reflects McCain&#8217;s poor judgment in making important decisions.</p>
<p>With all that saidl, there is just too much at stake for this election and American cannot just live with another Republican president, but rather an exceptional President that will lead and not follow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, this was what <a href="http://theobamapound.com/2008/10/our-electoral-prediction-obama-wins-355-to-183/">our electoral predictions</a> is and why? I think the answer is pretty simple. I think many Americans are finally learning that the country really needs someone who can bring real change and responsibility to the governement. If you have been to one of the rallies for Obama or have watched one on TV, you would surely have noticed that Obama will be a President who is going to work hard for you.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://theobamapound.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/obama-wins.jpg" alt="Obama wins election" width="344" height="224" />Even as McCain is ever so convinced that the Mac is back, we don&#8217;t really think so. And the reason is simple, McCain ran his campaign like a politician and not like a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we will see record breaking turn outs. Tomorrow I believe there will be many surprising results. States that were once Red will turn Blue. With the time coming close to the end, both Obama and McCain have been campaigning hard today.</p>
<p>Today, we saw Senator Obama announced <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g3m4YaeYwDHXS6hHdZJi8pm6cZdAD947RJKO0">the loss of his Grandmother</a> whom has been battling cancer. Our sincere condolences to Senator Obama and his family. This devastating news however did not stop Senator from campaigning and talking to tens of thousands of supporters at University of North-Carolina, Charlotte. &#8220;She&#8217;s gone home,&#8221; These were the very words that Senator Obama used.</p>
<p>With less than 24 hours to go, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/02/latest-presidential-polls_n_140177.html">polls are showing that Senator Obama is 7-8 points ahead of McCain</a>. The time has come to go out and vote. YES! GO OUT AND VOTE. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/03/did-obama-win-yet/">You owe this to yourselves to make sure that only the best candidate should emerge victory. And this is no other than Senator Obama</a>.</p>
<p>God bless America and we win go out with victory tomorrow!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>CNN has a very nice <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/calculator/">Electoral Map calculator</a> that <a href="http://muchopolitico.blogspot.com/2008/10/electoral-map-predictions.html">allows you</a> to <a href="http://twomatts.wordpress.com/2008/10/30/electoral-map-fun/">play political analys</a>t by i<a href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/_monday_was_biggest_day.php">nputing your predictions</a> on <a href="http://rhetoretician.livejournal.com/56712.html">what states would go blue and red</a>.Â  <a href="http://dorknation.wordpress.com/2008/10/30/my-electoral-map-obama-wins/">As you tweak the battleground states</a>, you will seeÂ  how many electoral votes each candidate has.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">So which States would make history on election night? Here&#8217;s how Huffington post sees it:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: left;"><p>The East Coast states will report first. If John McCain is going to win, then he will win Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. And then it will take the rest of the night to figure out if he still has enough electoral votes. Obama&#8217;s victory could be a lot easier to figure out.</p>
<p>If Obama wins Virginia - it&#8217;s over. That simple. He is comfortably ahead in all of the blue states that John Kerry won in 2004. He is very likely to win all of those. He is also comfortably ahead in <a href="http://www.theyoungturks.com/story/2008/10/5/221347/635/Diary/Iowa-New-Mexico-Colorado">Iowa and New Mexico</a>. So, that means all he has to do to get an electoral majority is win Virginia, or Ohio, or Florida, or Colorado. Any of them will do. If McCain wins three out of the four, he still loses.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">What does this mean for McCain? He is in bad position, really bad position. McCain&#8217;s campaign is seeing the impossible uphill climb they&#8217;re facing. In the past few days, we <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/31/eagleburger-blisters-pali_n_139524.html">have been seeing finger pointing</a> within the McCain camp, <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/10262008/news/politics/pit_bull_turns_on_mcmaverick_135366.htm">mostly with McCain&#8217;s advisors expressing their unhappiness</a> with <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/10/sarah_palin_rogue_diva_elephan.html">Sarah Palin going rouge</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I honestly do believe that the nation is going to be shocked by the results on November 4th. The republican saw a unexpected defeat when the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/08/election.main/index.html">Democrats took over the majority of the Senate in 2006</a>. Back then, most Americans still had some faith in the Republican President and government. In 2008, we saw one of the biggest financial crisis in decades.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.simplebucket.com/p/mdq4nzm?size=orig"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/sbkt/pictures/17563/2008-electoral-prediction_med.jpg" alt="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our electoral prediction, Obama wins by 355 to 183. To do that, we are predicting that Obama will take all the battleground states - Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. Like we have said previously, we think the electionÂ  result s<a href="http://theobamapound.com/2008/10/does-your-vote-matter-anymore/">hould be known minutes after 9pm EST</a> as results for eastern part of the country comes out. Being a Hoosier myself, I would personally want to see Indiana go blue this time around and we will soon have the true leadership that the nation needs.</p>
<p><strong>Take our poll and tell us which battleground states will Obama take!</strong></p>
