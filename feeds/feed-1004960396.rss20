Fortunately, we're aware of these and many of our other shortcomings and we have plenty of new announcements to make soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks as always, Duncan!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">danielha</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2008 01:29:02 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: 2 Trackback points</title><link>http://disqus.disqus.com/2_trackback_points/#comment-4240315</link><description>Agreed with both of these points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the feedback.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">danielha</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2008 00:01:08 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Internationalization, we need a couple good souls to test it. =)</title><link>http://blog.disqus.net/2008/12/04/internationalization-we-need-a-couple-good-souls-to-test-it/#comment-4219082</link><description>Latvians love their blog comments.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">danielha</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2008 04:57:58 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Howto: Mark Spam</title><link>http://blog.disqus.net/2008/12/03/howto-mark-spam/#comment-4172576</link><description>No, that would not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The command is just the word and nothing else.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">danielha</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 20:34:05 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Change the color of disqus font</title><link>http://disqus.disqus.com/change_the_color_of_disqus_font/#comment-4169133</link><description>How do I get it so the code doesn't show up on my page?

I'm hoping that Disqus does as well as Akismet has over the years.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">http://www.radicalbehavior.com/new-site-commenting-system-disqus/</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2008 14:35:13 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: New Site Commenting System - Disqus</title><link>http://www.radicalbehavior.com/new-site-commenting-system-disqus/#comment-4079154</link><description>Hey there, I'm Daniel from Disqus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I noticed Disqus installed on DisneyFrontier (I'm a Disney fan).

Thanks for taking the time to inform about the click through. I guess Kay didn't have more comments in the system at the time. I can see a very different from your profile -- 320 pages!! Now that really makes a difference to my thinking about Disqus, and makes it considerably more useful than I first thought it would be.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">http://www.ephemeralthoughts.com/?p=955</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2008 12:01:07 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Feed Delivery Changes &amp;#038; Other Stuff</title><link>http://www.ephemeralthoughts.com/?p=955#comment-4019023</link><description>Hi there, Daniel from Disqus here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pop up shows your latest 3 comments.
