			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well things are heating up here as the temperature drops.</p>
<p>As a lot of you know, the plan for us when we arrived in the Netherlands was for Femke to get a job, and then I can get a residency permit. With this permit I would be allowed to work here for up to a year. At that stage we could renew the residency permit if we wanted to stay.</p>
<p>When we were in New Zealand I made several Skype calls to Dutch Immigration ensuring that we would be right as long as Femke had a job. We were assured this was the case. So after the New Zealand adventure ended and three weeks rest in Australia, we were off to Holland!</p>
<p>So skip to December 2008, Femke has a job, and I even have a local job offer as well through a friend of a friend. Awesome! Things are looking up! So we try to get the Residency Permit so I could start work ASAP,&#160; only to be told that no we can’t get it. Umm WTF? and why not? Because Femke’s contract is for 6 months and not 12 months. 12 months is required to qualify for a residency permit. Was this explained to us when we were in New Zealand. No. Hell no.</p>
<p>Surely they could be lenient? I mean 6 months? Fem’s a good worker. Every company she has worked for has been sad to see her move on. It’s practically ensured that she would get extended. Nope. they don’t budge nor do they care. Sigh. Wonderful.</p>
<p>So why is that? do they think that I would be fine for 6 months, and the suddenly after 6 months I would become like a leech on the Dutch government? Even offering assurances <em>(backed by Fem’s parents)</em> that I would not become a dole-bludging leech this has no effect. </p>
<p>So with my primary method of legally staying here now more sunk than the Titanic, what are my other options?</p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship via Fem’s Parents?</strong> This will cost over 800 Euros and will only be for 6 months. Also I would not be able to work during that period. This is more like an expensive extended tourist visa. Umm.. no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship via Femke herself?</strong> Again she needs a minimum of 12 months contract and earning more money she is currently on. So this is a no go.</p>
<p><strong>The highly skilled migrant visa:</strong> If I get a job earning 47,500 Euros a year, I will qualify for this visa which will allow me to stay here. Only issue is that it is a very high amount to be paying someone<em> (especially someone new),</em> and the number of English speaking programming jobs is very small. Also to apply for this there is still a 2 months waiting period for this visa to be approved. Normally this visa would be used to entice people over from overseas. They could all the paperwork before they came here. So when the time came they could arrive, get off the plane and go straight to work.</p>
<p> I can try to give my resume to some agencies and see what happens. But with Christmas and new years very fast approaching, it seems that employers are not really going to be looking for new people until mid Jan 2009. But it certainly won’t hurt to try.</p>
<p><strong>The work permit visa.</strong> This allows me to accept a job at a company after they have advertised a job for up to 6 weeks and shown proof that no local Dutch people could satisfy the role. This might be difficult for the company offering me the job as they have not advertised the role, but I am yet to hear from them. I can look for other jobs online that have already have been advertised and hope they are close to their 6 week date. But again it’s going to be slim picking with my inability to speak Dutch.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that my tourist Visa runs out and I have to return to Australia in early February. We’ll just have to see what happens. Cross your fingers for me!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night was the 5th of December here. This is where Sinterklaas is celebrated in the homes in the Netherlands. You could think of the the evening of the 5th of December as being the same as the morning of the 25th of December in Australia.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0605-resize.jpg"><img title="The table of goodies before we started" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="The table of goodies before we started" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0605-resize-thumb.jpg" width="194" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0611-resize.jpg"><img title="Fem with her cat" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="Fem with her cat" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0611-resize-thumb.jpg" width="432" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0610-resize.jpg"><img title="Fem&#39;s mum feeding the cat" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="Fem&#39;s mum feeding the cat" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0610-resize-thumb.jpg" width="194" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>The only main difference I noted was that the presents were not under a tree, but they were in a bag<em> (Sinterklaas’s bag!)</em> that was brought down from upstairs when the time was right. So after watching some <strong>very </strong>important shows on TV <em>(Dutch soaps)</em>, Fem and her mum went upstairs to bring down the bag.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0612-resize.jpg"><img title="The cat amazed at how awesome the 50D is" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="The cat amazed at how awesome the 50D is" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0612-resize-thumb.jpg" width="432" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0619-resize.jpg"><img title="Fem with the bag!" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="Fem with the bag!" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0619-resize-thumb.jpg" width="432" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>We then had drinks and yummy nibbiles <em>(including Fem’s delicious apple turnovers) </em>on the table while Auke, handed out the presents. The presents were unwrapped one at a time so everyone can see your reaction and enjoyment. I was very happy and surprised with what I received. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Undutchables-Observation-Netherlands-Culture-Inhabitants/dp/1888580321/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228557323&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">The Undutchables</a> which is an accurate and humorous take on life in the Netherlands.</li>
<li>A soft bicycle seat cover to help my not yet fully formed biker’s bum.</li>
<li>A sample of local Waalwijk beers and liqueurs. </li>
<li>A giant M in rich milk chocolate. <em>Yum!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0622-resize.jpg"><img title="After the unwrapping" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="After the unwrapping" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0622-resize-thumb.jpg" width="432" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0623-resize.jpg"><img title="The gifts I received" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="289" alt="The gifts I received" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0623-resize-thumb.jpg" width="432" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>It is Dutch tradition to give small poems along with the gifts on Sinterklaas. Fem and her parents got their Dutch poems first, and with my final present I got my poem as well.</p>
<p>I have attached a copy of it below as I thought it was very sweet and well done!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0624-resize.jpg"><img title="The poem I got" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="295" alt="The poem I got" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0624-resize-thumb.jpg" width="197" border="0" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 29th of November, after a few weeks of me doing remote work away at home and Fem looking for work, we decided to explore the city of Den Bosch.</p>
<p>This city is roughly 20 minutes drive east of Waalwijk. We went there by bus on a very chilly morning. You know it’s a chilly morning when your face goes numb from just the morning air.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0502-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="Main street of Den Bosch" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0502-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Main street of Den Bosch" width="198" height="295" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0505-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="Crossing one of the many rivers around the city" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0505-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Crossing one of the many rivers around the city" width="432" height="289" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0504-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="Cool statue on a roundabout" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0504-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Cool statue on a roundabout" width="198" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>The Saturday markets were on, so we looked around for some good deals. After finding some good nibblies, we just walked around the streets. The city seems to have a maximum building height of about 5 stories. Plus the street layout was a bit random with plenty of side streets, ally ways and lanes. Without a map, you would get lost very quickly, as it’s hard to get your barings with most streets looking very similar.</p>
<p>There is a bakery near the main train/bus station that is famous for it’s “bosche-bollens”. <em>(I am certain I have misspelt that)</em> These are servings of tennis ball sized whipped cream covered in a thin layer of deep fried dough and then a generous layer of chocolate. The Dutch, thankfully have stayed away from this horrendous “mock cream” that is usually put on all Australian cream buns, so you get a lot of thin beautifully rich whipped full cream and oh is it yummy. Fem tells me people come from far and wide just to go to this bakery. Each time we walked past it, there was a a queue spilling out into the street for it. <img src='http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The highlight of the day was going to the Saint Jan cathedral in town. This is by far the largest and the oldest cathedral I have been to. The insides were utterly stunning and awe inspiring. The amount of detail on the woodwork, the statues, the stained glass and the massive paintings has to be seen to be believed.  The lighting inside were a little dim, so I had to up the ISO on my wonderful Canon 50D to get a decent shutter speed.  <em>(Have I mentioned how much I love my camera?)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0513-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="Wow.. what a massive organ" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0513-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Wow.. what a massive organ" width="198" height="295" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0515-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="inside the Saint Jan church" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0515-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="inside the Saint Jan church" width="198" height="295" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0530-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="huge size" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0530-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="huge size" width="198" height="295" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0535-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="interesting touch with the dove underneath" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0535-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="interesting touch with the dove underneath" width="198" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>This church was created around 1200. So that makes it roughly 4 times older than Australia. On the back wall is this unbelievably huge piano organ, which you can see it in the first photo. I have included some tourists at the bottom of the photo so you get a sense of scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0533-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="great light display" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0533-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="great light display" width="432" height="289" /></a> <a href="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0542-resize.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" title="detailed stained glass" src="http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img-0542-resize-thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="detailed stained glass" width="432" height="289" /></a></p>
<p>Some basic stats: Length – 115m, Width – 62m, Height of the dome Ceiling – 41m, Height of the outside spire – 73m. Number of statues inside and out – 600</p>
<p>Number of bells – 59, weight of the largest bell – 5500kg.</p>

<p>There are even noblemen buried inside the church. When you walk down the isle ways, it’s common to actually be walking on people graves. Interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>Once outside, due to how close the town is built to the church it’s hard to get the whole thing into a single shot. Obviously this is not the largest cathedral in Europe but it was very impressive to me. I am looking forward to seeing other massive ones!</p>

<p>On Christmas day we are thinking of coming back here at night, as it is lit up really well and will have a good atmosphere. Hope to get some more great shots of it then!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 15th of November, the Netherlands celebrated the arrival of Sinterklaas!</p>
<p>This involved watching the main parade on TV that day. Each year Sinterklaas arrived via ship to one Dutch town that has a harbour. There he on top of his white horse and his dozens of Black Pete assistants then hand out candy and treats to the delighted children and parade through the city. They end up at the town hall where there is a speech by that town’s mayor and there is plenty of celebration all around. The theme this year was red balloons. So there are red balloons attached to all the major landmarks around the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Obviously from Australia’s perspective Sinterklaas is like our Santa Claus, and the Black Pete’s are the elves.</p>
<p>One attraction of the whole parade is that there are always things that “go wrong”, and it’s interesting to watch and see how the Black Petes get Sinterklaas out of the trouble. This year his boat got “stuck” in the harbour. They solved that issue by attaching all these red balloons to the ship and that lifted it high over the obstacle.</p>
<p>Also Sinterklaas’s main chair at the town hall was destroyed by a parachuting Black Pete who landed on it. The TV kept cutting back to this poor Pete who was desperately trying to get a replacement chair before the parade snaked it’s way to Town Hall. Of course he comes up with comical alternatives such as a toilet, a wheelchair and a really tiny chair, but just before Sinterklaas arrived he was able to get the correct chair replaced in time! It’s all good fun and quite entertaining to watch.</p>
<p>On the 16th, each Dutch town gets their own Sinterklaas parade. Obviously it’s smaller than they main one on TV the previous day, but it’s still good to see everyone out and about. There were lots of Black Petes doing acrobatic dances and jumps and plenty handing out candy to all the children. Most of the children had bags to catch all the candy in <img src='http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Below are the shots from the parade in Waalwijk.</p>

<p>Up until the 5th of December, each morning when you wake up, there <strong>might </strong>be some chocolate waiting for you. This is what Fem and I received this morning from Fem’s parent. We also give them sweet treats every few mornings as well!</p>

<p>Then on the 5th of December, we would then exchange small gifts. (no this does not occur on the 25th ) <img src='http://blog.mattcorr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 9th of November, Fem and I drove to the old town of Heusden which is just north of Waalwijk. You can see from the aerial shot from Google maps, that Heusden is an odd looking town practically surrounded by a moat. This was due to it being a heavily fortified town back in the middle ages.</p>

<p> It has the old style charm for a Dutch town. A lot of history and a few windmills scattered around it’s fringe. Since it was Sunday when we went, there was not a lot of people out and about. By the time we left in the early afternoon it has opened up a bit more.</p>

<p>Fem and I spent the morning there, just looking around, getting some shots and had a nice lunch at one of the restaurants.</p>

<p>We noticing a group of dog walkers gathering. What was interesting was that nearly every dog was a Dachshund! Must be a common theme for this town. I was surprised how loud the bark was for such a small dog! </p>

<p>It was a nice little town to visit! There were lots of side streets and nooks and crannies, so it would be pretty easy to get lost there if you were new to the place.</p>
