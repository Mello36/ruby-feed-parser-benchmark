<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) remains critically important for B2B marketers doing lead generation online. And it's pretty common advice to hear: launch a blog because the relevant content will attract links and improve your search engine visibility. </p>

<p>Blogs can offer little-known companies name recognition, and the chance to boost traffic and generate leads well beyond what they'd get if they were simply offering a list of goods and services for sale on their website. </p>

<p>But should you write a blog exclusively for search engine visibility? </p>

<p>Some what say yes but not me. I think a frequently updated, well written
and relevant blog by an author who has passion for the subject will out perform others that were only for SEO. </p>

<p>Lee Odden over at the <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/">Online Marketing Blog</a> shares a useful perspective on why blogs written solely for SEO objectives will inevitably fail. If you're thinking of blogging for SEO it's definitely worth checking out. </p>

Wow! <br /><br />In my presentation I emphasized how lead nurturing is about timing, consistency and relevance. <br /><br />Today (which happens to be my 38th birthday) I got this email with a personal video from Gary Anderson, CEO of NetBriefings. I wanted to share this with you because I think it is a great example of lead nurturing by combining the human touch and timing in a personal way that connected with their business value proposition.</span></p><blockquote><p><span face="Calibri">Brian, I heard it was your Birthday today!&nbsp; <br /></span></p>

<p><span face="Calibri">Here is my personal Birthday Video Greeting!</span></p>

Anderson</span></p></blockquote> <p><span face="Calibri">The video is 29 seconds but it made
my day and I must confess that it caused me to think about his company
(which is the point). Please note: it's not a polished or pretty video but he put in
some effort to be personal and that's what made it stand out. That said, I don't think this would work for everybody. </span><span face="Calibri">&nbsp;</span><span face="Calibri">Let me know what you think. </span></p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are numerous tactics for generating leads these days — everything from the traditional email or phone call to the explosively popular social media craze. However, the real challenge is not necessarily in generating leads, but more in truly connecting with them. It doesn’t matter how many leads you generate if they aren’t willing to listen to what you have to say next. </p>

<p>You need to develop and then engage in memorable and relevant conversations with prospects. You need to position your company as a thought leader and solution provider that understands your prospect’s needs. You need that “human touch.”</p>

<p> During this one-hour, live webinar you will learn how to:</p>

<ul><li>Engage your prospects with memorable and relevant conversations</li>

<li>Build and maintain quality relationships with potential clients</li>

<li>Develop a lead-nurturing process that really works</li>

<li>Recapture lost leads and opportunities</li></ul>

<p>I’m teaming up with <a href="http://learn.gotomeeting.com/forms/G2MC-WBR-120908?ID=7010000000057dp">Citrix Online</a> to bring this webinar to marketers of all levels. Whether you are a VP of Marketing, a VP or Director of Sales, or a Sales or Marketing Consultant, you’ll learn how to connect by sharing your expertise. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you wish companies would stop doing when you download a free white paper?</p>

<p>I bet I already know. I had a conversation recently with my business development executive who has become highly suspicious of &quot;free&quot; white paper downloads. There are some sites that he refuses to download from because not only was the prior information unhelpful, but he knows he will receive a call from a telemarketer - even after he's made it clear he's not interested. Why do we continue to force people into being &quot;leads&quot;?</p>

<p>People download content often to answer questions. Don't assume that because they downloaded something that they are ready to talk to a sales person. You need to first connect with your potential lead. </p>

<p>I've found that calling people is the best way to qualify leads, and if that phone call is conducted correctly it can be the start of a really good relationship. If there is an initiative invariably people will tell more about their project and what they are trying to do. The nuance matters and it helps you sound less like a pusher and more like a relevant resource.</p>

<p>A good example of a follow up comes from <a href="http://www.endeca.com/">Endeca</a>. When my colleague downloaded a white paper from their site, Endeca's follow-up was very professional. The call opened with questions about what led him to take a look at their paper. They asked what he found particularly interesting about the download.</p>

<p>When InTouch handles inquiry/lead qualification for our clients, we typically start off with something like, &quot;A lot of people download our white papers to get their questions answered. I was wondering if you got a chance to read (insert title of the download), and if your question got answered. Or, is there some other way that I can help?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Also, rather than asking, &quot;Are you the decision maker for the company?&quot; ask something like, &quot;Were you trying to answer this question for yourself or another member of your team so I can help you get the needed information.&quot;</p>

<p>There has to be a balance between collecting information and providing value. If you'll think of Lead Generation as a process of micro-conversions that build opportunity profiles over time, you'll be successful. With that in mind, here are some things to think about when offering 'free' information:</p>

<ul><li>Downloads that are thinly-veiled product brochures and technical documents of the offered product are not only unprofessional, they're ineffective.</li>

<li>Be careful about requiring registration to receive anything worthwhile.&nbsp; Request an email address first, then later on a first and last name. Requesting a phone number should be later on in the process. </li>

<li>Sales teams should never receive Web inquiries directly and unqualified (truth be told - sales people only want to talk to people who actually WANT to talk to them)</li>

<li>Contacts should be established with potential customers to prime them into the lead-nurturing program </li>

<li>Web site forms should be to the point for maximum response </li>

<li>All inquiries should be responded to with a prompt note of thanks (how good is your &quot;thank you&quot; auto reply?) </li>

<li>A supplementary email thank you should be used to share value added relevant data </li></ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do so many companies struggle with the lead generation process?&nbsp; Simple. Even the very best lead generation program cannot compensate for poor teamwork and collaboration. You can actually achieve major ROI gains by optimizing a just few key aspects of your lead management process. </p>

<p>I just finished up the MarketingSherpa Demand Generation Summit in Boston where I was given the opportunity to present my ‘Playbook for Effective Lead Management.’&nbsp; And, we’re doing it all again in San Francisco October 26-28. Check out the <a href="http://www.sherpastore.com/btobhandbookpack.html">full agenda.</a> I hope you can make it. </p>

<p>If you attended MarketingExperiments’ recent Web Clinic on September 24th you've already got a glimpse of my five-step ‘playbook.’&nbsp; By applying the ‘playbook’ as a tool to identify, evaluate, and address the underlying issues, we show how a company benefited from a 325% growth in sales ready leads and a 200% growth in lead-to-sale pipeline rate. </p>

<p>What you need to understand is that this client did not spend any more budget to achieve these results. Rather, a greater focus was put on developing and executing an <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/services/lead-management.asp">optimized lead management proces</a><a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/services/lead-management.asp">s</a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></p>

<p><a href="http://ceoideas.blogspot.com/2008/09/demand-generation-grows-up-finally.html">Jeff Ogden: Demand Generation grows up -- finally</a> </p><p>Here’s a quick look at the process we took the company
through:

</p>

<ol><li><strong>Refine the universal lead definition of “sales ready.”</strong> It’s imperative that both marketing and sales agree on the definition of a lead. Each time you hire new staff, use that as an opportunity to visit the definition again. </li>

<li><strong>Qualify leads based on universal lead definition. </strong>When you qualify leads against a universal lead definition you’ll get higher lead-to-opportunity conversion rate and start to overcome some friction.</li>

<li><strong>Nurture early leads until “sales ready.” </strong>This is where marketers can apply a measurable process to create relevant, consistent dialog with viable potential customers. Position yourself as a reliable resource for folks and when they are ready to buy, they will come to you.</li>

<li><strong>Define hand-off process from Marketing to Sales. </strong>Make sure leads are sales ready, confirm that leads are ready to speak with a sales representative, and provide qualification information for each lead. Agree on a turnaround time to get feedback from sales. Study the documentation process chart included in the Webinar. It shows the steps a lead should go through from marketing to sales.</li>

<li><strong>Close the loop via Sales and Marketing “huddle.” </strong>Huddling once a quarter is not enough. Examine often what’s working and what’s not working. Know the status of every single lead at all times. </li></ol>

<p>I’ve already fielded questions from the presentation, but would love to hear from you as well. View the clinic and send me your thoughts. </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lack of a strong <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/lead_nurturing/index.html">lead nurturing</a> discipline can cost your
organization substantial unrealized revenue. Without lead nurturing in
place to capture and cultivate early-stage leads, your marketing funnel
misses out on valuable opportunities. </p>

<p>The true value of lead nurturing
comes from the technique of staying in touch with prospects while
providing them with the relevant information as they move through the
evaluation and buying process. But, how do you get that delicate
balance just right?&nbsp; </p>

<p>I’ve gotten the okay to highlight 5 Nurture Campaign Time Factors from
MarketingSherpa’s new <a href="http://leadgenhandbook.marketingsherpa.com/">B-to-B Lead Generation Handbook</a> that will
help you to fine tune the nurturing timing. MarketingSherpa uses
real-life examples and charts to hit home these five factors, but
here’s a quick look at them:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Immediate welcomes </strong><br />As soon as you receive a response to a lead generation campaign, you
should rush out a welcome message in reply. It’s just good manners to
acknowledge someone’s interest in your brand promptly.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Lead Qualification Telemarketing</strong><br />The velocity of follow-up matters. As soon as possible use telemarketing (aka teleprospecting) to qualify each lead. </p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Interest-level Timing</strong><br />
Most prospects go through a variety of interest levels in your brand.
Without being annoying, you need to stay in their radar until they
decide to make that buying decision. Identify where they are in the <strong>buying process</strong> so you can share relevant information at the right time (i.e. should you share a case study vs. white paper? etc).</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Industry Timing</strong><br />
It’s a given that you may need to adjust your campaign timing to reflect your industry’s annual rhythms.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Job Function Timing</strong><br />
Data shows that a decision maker is heavily involved at the very start
and the very end of the process, but leaves the middle of the process
up to the influencers. For your niche, you’ll need to investigate who
gets involved at which point in the process so that you can segment
your messaging.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I encourage you to check out MarketingSherpa’s B-to-B Lead Generation
Handbook. It is a&nbsp; monster of a book, but I assure you it’s jam packed
with practical, hands-on advice for B-to-B marketers. </p>

The challenge that many organizations face is that their lead management process is a black hole.</p>

<p>I’ll address this proverbial black hole between your company’s sales and marketing efforts during a <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/">MarketingExperiments’</a> Web Clinic on Wednesday, September 24 at 4 p.m. EST. I’ll outline ways to build an operational ‘playbook’ with your sales department to better manage and nurture the leads you generate. </p>

<p>By using this approach I will share how we helped one client increase their sales-ready leads by 375% and increase their lead-to-sales pipeline conversion rate by 200%. I’ll be answering your lead-gen questions as well. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To what extent can emails be used in place of phone calls and face-to-face meetings when maintaining and developing relationships with clients and other important network contacts?</p>

<p>Four bloggers have all agreed to post their answers to the email question simultaneously, each offering a different perspective, with all responses linked.&nbsp; They are:</p>

<ol><li><a href="http://www.hardingco.com/blog">Ford Harding</a>, student of selling professional services.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.legalmarketingblog.com/">Tom Kane</a>, specialist on marketing and selling legal services.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.constructionmarketingideas.blogspot.com/">Mark Buckshon</a>, prodigious blogger and specialist on marketing and selling design and construction services.</li>

<li>Yours Truly </li></ol>

<p>I could make affirmative and negative arguments for email, phone calls and face-to-face meetings depending on the situation. But I think the answer to this question really revolves around the “maintaining and developing relationships.” In the end it all comes down to relationships. </p>

<p>I've found that emails, phone calls and face-to-face meetings all can help you start or continue conversations but they won't do the hard work of building relationships for you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My research shows that executive buyers choose the sales person who has been a resource and developed a relationship with them regardless of their timing to buy.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Average sales people think they are most effective when they talk with someone WHEN they are ready to buy, but top performers seek to build relationships with the right people in the right companies BEFORE they're ready to buy.</p>

<p>Today’s prospects have a general lack of trust and they simply don’t want to be sold. They are weary of pitches, hype, pushy sales people and manipulative marketing tactics. They are time constrained and too busy to think. So what do they do with most of our sales and marketing messages)? They simply ignore them.</p>

<p>Time and time again it is proven that customers want the salespeople
they deal with to understand their business, their needs, and the
pressures under which they operate. These people are called <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2005/04/lead_generation.html">trusted advisors</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For this reason, I think it’s critical to contact and have initial
conversations with our future customers that are devoid of sales
pitches. Quite literally when we begin a conversation with them, their
attitudes and beliefs are being shaped, primed by the information they
have already soaked up through various sources.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
Be a resource to them regardless of their timing to buy. Otherwise,
they are likely to get information from the internet or uninformed
colleagues, trade publications or heaven forbid your competitors. </p>

<p>
And I think a perfect way to do this is through <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=316">lead nurturing</a>. A key aspect of lead nurturing is the ability to provide relevant, <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2005/06/using_thought_l.html">valuable education and information</a>
to prospects up front. In this way you will be able to position
yourself as a trusted advisor and perhaps even a thought leader. </p>

<p>Again, it’s about relationships. The key I think is putting the
interests of our current or future customers first. That’s not always
easy especially when we’re trying to meet objectives, growth goals etc.
But when you do that, you don’t have to sell to people. You'll start to
find they even will come
to you first when they are ready. </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently interviewed for an article on lead management by Chris Koch who works for <a href="http://www.itsma.com/">ITSMA</a>, the Information Technology Services Marketing Association. </p>

<p>In the article titled, &quot;<a href="http://www.itsma.com/NL/article.asp?ID=401">Building a Marketing Funnel and Other Lead Management Tips</a>,&quot; I give the following five tips on how you can make your B2B lead management more effective, which are:</p>

<ol><li>Create a marketing funnel.</li>

<li>Create a universal definition of a lead. </li>

<li>Use the phone.</li>

<li>Ask about goals—don’t sell. </li>

<li>Define lead nurturing—and the right people to nurture. </li></ol>

<p>Here’s a short excerpt from my interview.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">1. Create a marketing funnel. </p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Most organizations don’t have a marketing funnel; they have a sales funnel that looks more like a bucket with lots of holes in it where leads leak out. Marketing needs to create its own funnel to understand whether leads are sales ready or not.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The purpose of the marketing funnel is to bring leads into one spot and qualify them. By qualifying them, I mean that the leads are ready to talk to someone from a sales perspective. Then there is the hand-off process between marketing and sales. I find that connecting the marketing and sales funnel together is really a big challenge. You have to understand your sales process to know at what point the sales team views a lead as an opportunity and begins actively pursuing it. </p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Lead generation really is about building relationships. It’s how can I help my sales team build relationships with the right people and the right companies. The marketing funnel creates sales-ready leads and nurtures the leads that aren’t sales ready. </p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The bigger and better you make your marketing pipeline, ultimately the bigger and better you make your sales pipeline. In the end, this isn’t about generating more leads; it’s about generating actionable leads.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MarketingSherpa just published data on lead nurturing best practices based on a survey of 1,000 marketers. Sherpa's research focuses on the following nurturing best practices:</p>

<ul><li>Using multiple tactics rather than relying on email only. </li>

<li>Timing of teleprospecting response to web inquiries – the velocity of follow-up dramtically impacts lead conversion.</li>

<li>Measurement of lead quality and the impact of lead nurturing.</li></ul>

<p>I encourage you check out their advice. Read <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.html?id=30757">MarketingSherpa: Lead Nurturing Best Practices: New Data, Charts, Tips to Put More Punch in Your Cultivation Tactics</a></p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/lead_nurturing/index.html">lead nurturing</a>, I find that marketers lose their momentum because they lack enough edu-focused content. My advice is to start building your lead nurturing library now. Here's a post where I share <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/08/content-ideas-1.html">content ideas for lead nurturing and the best tactics to use</a>.

<title>Rainmakers and Lead Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In professional services organizations the people who bring in the big revenue clients are often called rainmakers. They’re the one’s that make it all happen and become almost mythical in the process. In today’s challenging business climate, we could all use more rainmakers. </p>

<p>I like what Ford Harding, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1598695886/startwithalea-20"><em>Rain Making, Attract New Clients No Matter What Your Field, 2nd Edition</em></a> and President of <a href="http://www.hardingco.com/blog/">Harding &amp; Company</a> had to say about rainmakers.</p>

<p>Harding writes, “A rainmaker, as we define one, brings in leads and converts them into business at such levels that she leaves her colleagues in awe.&nbsp; Of the two talents, lead generation and lead conversion, the former is much the rarer.&nbsp; That is, professionals who can sell, once given a lead outnumber those who can generate leads, but can’t convert them into business.”</p>

<p>Ford cites my book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071458972/startwithalea-20"><em>Lead Generation for the Complex Sale</em></a> in his post, &quot;<a href="http://www.hardingco.com/blog/2008/06/02/lead-flow-part-1-how-it-makes-the-rainmaker/">Lead Flow Part #1: How It Makes the Rainmaker</a>,&quot; along several good ideas, which I’ll summarize. </p>

<ol><li><strong>Try what’s worked before.</strong> Look for patterns of success, ask your clients for advice and ideas on how they have been approached by other professionals (even your competition) to find out what worked and what didn’t. </li>

<li><strong>Experiment and adapt.</strong>&nbsp; Some trial and error learning is inevitable as you try to master lead generation. Develop a plan and use multiple tactics.</li>

<li><strong>Don’t let up.&nbsp; </strong>Be consistent. Try to do at least one lead generation thing every day, even if it is something small, that will help you get into a conversation with a prospective client. If you use calling, resolve to make an extra call a day before you leave. If you do networking, resolve to meet one more person at an event.</li></ol><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Webinars and webcasts are a key tactic in lead generation toolkit. The challenge with webinars is that if you don't do a super job, attendees will bail on you and they may never register one of your events again. </p>

<p>That's why I found this chart <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.html?id=30705">What Causes Webinar Attendees to Bail?</a> by MarketingSherpa useful.&nbsp; According to their research here are the top reasons attendees say they bail on a webinar. </p>

<ol><li>Content was not as advertised </li>

<li>Presenter(s) read directly from the slides </li>

<li>Webinar began with company/sales information (pitches)</li>

<li>You were familiar with the information in the first few slides </li>

<li>The webinar was an hour long </li>

<li>Presenter(s) spoke slowly&nbsp; </li></ol>

<p>Avoid these turnoffs and you'll increase the odds of return visitors to your webinars. </p>

<p>Please share your comments on other reasons why you bail from webinars and hopefully we help reduce the number of cruddy webinars out there. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest obstacle to go-to-market success (and lead generation ROI for that matter) is the lack of good execution. </p>

<p>The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council's latest study, “<a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/resources/form_bottom_line.asp">Driving the Bottom Line from the Front Line</a>,” assessed the go-to-market processes and capabilities of global companies. According to the study, &quot;Surprisingly, over 46% of respondents gave themselves failing grades when assessing their own go-to-market effectiveness, with only six percent giving their capabilities the highest marks, and just 29% calling themselves quite effective.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The study concluded that poor collaboration between sales and marketing is a key reason for go-to-market failure and this is where the leadership from upper management plays a vital role in successful execution. Todd Ebert over at the <a href="http://toddebert.typepad.com/">BAD Marketing Blog</a> gives some additional insights on the CMO study <a href="http://toddebert.typepad.com/bad_marketing/2008/06/cmo-council-releases-mindboggling-research-study.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I agree with their findings. With that said, it requires more than just effective upper management involvement. I believe that effective collaboration requires each of us to better managers ourselves.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Becoming an effective marketer goes far beyond creativity and careful campaign management. Like any other functional role, marketers will execute successfully, more often, if we are first and foremost good managers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Collaboration between sales and marketing and go-to-market execution will come more naturally if we each focus on our basic management skills: Leadership, communication, planning, organizing, staffing, and controlling. </p>

<p>I encourage you to check out <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060833459/startwithalea-20">The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done</a>. </em>If you only read one book about how to improve your personal effectiveness I think you will find this book to be a good choice. It was written quite a while ago but it's a wonderful resource. </p>

<title>Optimizing webforms to generate more leads through your website</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a talk on lead management, I spoke with several marketers from a company where one said, “We don’t need to qualify our leads because our web forms do the qualifying for us... then we send them to our sales team.” </p>

<p>Here's the problem with that model... long and detailed web forms often cause people to lie or simply leave altogether. </p>

<p>So what should you do instead? Start by creating a lead generation form that balances your need for information and potential buyers need for not being hassled. </p>

<p>Testing and optimizing even a few key aspects of your landing pages can provide major gains for your lead-gen efforts to improve lead conversion and ROI. </p>

<p>Recently, I was a guest on a web clinic Dr. Flint McGlaughlin, Director, <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/">MarketingExperiments</a> that examines three tests they conducted to demonstrate how you can use Incentives and Friction to generate more leads through your site.</p>

<p>The webinar was titled “Filling the Pipeline: How a LeadGen Test Strategy Achieved an 86% Increase” You can <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/images/multifiles/articulate/webclinic-06-11-08/player.html?=mej2">watch the webinar</a> (no registration required) or <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/improving-website-conversion/filling-the-pipeline.html">read the synopsis</a>.&nbsp; </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>”We know more about our prospects (leads) than we know about our current customers” was a shocking statement I heard from a client and it stuck with me. In fact, it's the impetus for this post.</p>

<p>When you have a complex sale, it can be easy to think of lead generation as only a process for acquiring new customers rather than a process that can also be applied to generating new or more business from current customers. </p>

<p>A while back I was in a meeting with a marketing leader of a Global 100 software firm.&nbsp; He shared a story about their new CEO at the time. The CEO asked 10 members of the executive team to write a list of their top-10 customers. Amazingly just 4 of the 10 executives got 5 of more of the customers correct!&nbsp; Their VP of Sales faired best, with correctly listing 8.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the same meeting it was pointed out that the top-10 customers accounted for over 50% of their $300 million in revenue. The CEO immediately declared that, “we're focusing on our customers first!” From that meeting they dubbed their new initiative as, “The Customer First Plan.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a result of reaching out and talking to their customers, they saw a net revenue increase of 15% from current customers and their customer referrals increased by over 100%.</p>

<p>Still, I’m amazed at how many marketers seem to only emphasize new account acquisition when they could also be going further with their existing customers. </p>

<p>According to research by the CMO Council, “<a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/news/pr/2008/041408.asp">Marketers Are Flying Blind When It Comes to Leveraging Customer Data</a>.” The study showed, “just 6 percent of marketers say they have excellent knowledge of the customers when it comes to demographic, behavioral, psychographic and transactional data, while over 50 percent report they have fair, little, or no knowledge of the customer.”</p><p>Conducted in late 2007 and early 2008, the CMO Council's “Business Gain From How You Retain” study undertook a wide-ranging evaluation of where and how marketers are &quot;operationalizing&quot; customer intelligence and insight to reduce customer churn, increase lifetime value, improve the customer experience, and increase the effectiveness and targeting of marketing spend.</p>

<p>The CMO Council concluded, “Only 50 percent of global marketers report having a strategy for further penetrating or monetizing key account relationships. In addition, a surprising 45 percent rate the effectiveness of customer relationship management (CRM) systems as deficient or needing more work, with only 15 percent of companies rating themselves extremely good or effective at integrating disparate customer data sources and repositories.”<br /><br />The solution to solving poor customer management is to leverage a processes that you already have (or should have!). A lead generation program that includes teleprospecting, lead nurturing and lead management. </p>

<p>Adding a customer program to the lead generation mix can be fairly straightforward. The messaging is a bit different, but ultimately we still need to be a relevant resource to people.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Often the first task in a customer program is to update the database. How long has it been since the database was verified? Are your contacts still there and are they in the same role? If you don’t already know the condition of your data, you can pull a random sample of data to test. Make sure you pull enough data to insure the test is statically valid. </p>

<p>Once the database is in working order, then question becomes, “How can we educate our current customers and affirm their decision to be working with us?” Nurture those all important relationships. Just like when reaching out to prospects, positioning you and your organization as trusted advisors is essential to building trust that starts AND maintains AND expands relationships. </p>

<p>From this point forward you should look to your current customers with the same energy and optimism as you do with your prospect and you’ll be amazed with the results. </p>

<p>So, do you have a Customer First Plan? </p><div class="feedflare">

<p>Michael Stelzner wrote the following comment on my post back then, “I have been giving away my trade secrets for years (against the advice of advisors). The results have been amazing. The fact is that folks look to you as a thought leader when you share your secrets. In addition, the discussion that comes from sharing results is a better idea.”</p>

<p>Today, Michael just launched a series of videos on how he is leveraging educational techniques to pull in inquiries and generate leads. Michael told me he's got a bunch of videos he plans to release over the next few days telling how he generated over 60,000 inquiries and leads for his business by giving away his ideas. </p>

<p>Watch his first video, &quot;<a href="http://www.whitepapersource.com/cmd.php?Clk=2373046">How To Generate Mass Interest in Your Business During Tough Times</a>.&quot; (No need to do anything special, it will just start playing.)</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the complex sale, the length of the buying cycle makes the connection between on-the-web activity and the off-line decision to purchase much more difficult to trace. So the challenge is connecting our website data (analytics), with marketing data (inquiries and leads) with the sales process and revenue (closing the loop).&nbsp; </p>

<p>I came across Manoj Jasra post, &quot;<a title="B2B Web Analytics: Deeper Dive - Web Analytics World" href="http://manojjasra.blogspot.com/2008/05/b2b-web-analytics-deeper-dive.html">B2B Web Analytics: Deeper Dive - Web Analytics World</a>&quot; and thought it was relevant to share.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Jasra writes, &quot;in order to be successful in a B2B world, marketers require a strong understanding in regards to their potential customers. Things such as lead qualification, targeting in the sales cycle, and testing content/collateral are all areas where analysts can push the envelope in order to provide more insight for their marketing team.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Jasra's post outlines four key analytic areas which include: quality of leads, sales cycle, optimizing your content (for SEO and conversion) and conversion rates and funnels. </p>

<p>Here are some posts that give more suggestions on analytics. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know about you but I seldom meet a B2B marketer who has time to think. And it seems that the pressure keeps building as more of us seek to do more with less.</p>

<p>That said, it’s vital for us to <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2006/01/this_years_hot_.html">think</a> before we execute. It’s not about doing more campaign activity… it’s about doing the right things repeatedly better. </p>

<p>The simple act of a sales and marketing team finding time to <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/10/question-lead-g.html">think and collaborate</a> together is vital to developing a solid lead generation program. Our results will improve because we're following this approach: ready, aim, aim, aim, and then fire.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Mike Gospe wrote a great piece for MarketingProfs, &quot;<a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/8/lead-generation-blueprints-in-30-minutes-gospe.asp">Lead-Generation Blueprints in 30 Minutes</a>.&quot; I like the article because it shows how one marketer took time (just 30 minutes) to think out a problem with his sales team and develop a game plan before they executed. The ROI results of this approach are truly remarkable. </p>

<p>My sales and marketing meets together weekly via &quot;<a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2006/07/closed_loop_fee.html">huddles</a>&quot; it really helps them get the same page and collaborate. It's amazing what can be accomplished in just 30 minutes. </p>

<p>I just interviewed Sridhar Ramanathan, President of <a href="http://www.pacifica-group.com/">Pacifica Group</a>, on how to evaluate and optimize outsourced teleprospecting partnerships (aka inside sales, telesales, telemarketing).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sridhar is an industry thought leader in marketing and former HP executive that grew HP's Managed Services unit to $1B in revenue. He has spent that last seven years advising his clients at Pacifica group on how to implement successful marketing strategies that increase revenue.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you are involved in lead generation for a complex sale, this podcast offers practical information you won't want to miss. </p>

<p>During the interview you will hear Sridhar discuss:</p>

<ul><li>Why his client's decide to outsource </li>

<li>What to have ready before engaging a firm</li>

<li>The criteria companies should use when hiring a firm </li>

<li>Success metrics used to evaluate effectiveness</li>

<li>Pitfalls to avoid in a partnership</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The faster we can get new sales reps producing revenue the better. So what works? Jill Konrath shares <a href="http://sellingtobigcompanies.blogs.com/selling/2008/04/top-5-tips-for.html">5 great tips for new sellers</a> on her <a href="http://sellingtobigcompanies.blogs.com/selling/2008/04/top-5-tips-for.html">Selling to BIG Companies Blog</a> and it’s definitely worth a read. I particularity liked tip number four about creating an “account entry campaign.” </p>

<p>One of the most difficult and consistent challenges for sales people is getting their foot in the door with the right people, at the right companies. Here's 5 more lead generation tips I’d recommend for new sellers. </p>

<p>1. Define your goals – Be clear on what you want. Do you want 20 more leads in your database? Do you want to generate $995K in net new customer in revenue this year? Do you want to add 15 new clients this quarter? </p>

<p>2. Develop a lead generation calendar - Map out your activities for each month and then really follow it! Don’t just make irrelevant pitches more often! Create a plan to add value every time you touch your future customers with relevant ideas, content and resources. </p><p>3. Build your personal prospecting engine - Leverage these activities by communicating with your prospects, customers, networks and alliance partners in a consistent manner by using traditional direct marketing methods such as direct mail, phone calls, and personal email messages. </p>

<p>4. Use your CRM - Don’t create the biggest database of contacts possible. Instead, seek to create the <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/03/would_you_buy_t.html">most relevant database possible</a> that contains the right companies and contacts that influence the buying decision. In the beginning, you won’t have all the data you need. Be patient and you'll build the opportunity profile over time. See each conversation as an opportunity to build a relationship. </p>

<p>5. Be consistent - Remember the fable about the tortoise and the hare? Dig your well before you’re thirsty. No matter how busy you are, be sure to make time to do lead generation activities, especially if you don’t have a marketing team supporting you. </p>

<p>Your suggestions please...what else would you add to this list? </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you do with leads or inquires once you generate them? </p>

<p>This basic question is overlooked by so many and yet it’s the leading cause of failure in what would otherwise be effective lead generation programs. </p>

<p>The common-sense answer to this challenge is easier said than done: Have your best people respond to them quickly and consistently in order to qualify them into sales ready leads. The ones that aren’t qualified yet (but are a fit) you put into a lead nurturing process.</p>

<p>The need to better manage leads and inquires has given rise to a slew of new software companies offering a variety of lead management or marketing automation solutions.&nbsp; </p>

<p>An interesting conversation was started recently by Laura Ramos on the Forrester Marketing blog about lead management software. I’m really glad to see an analyst giving their opinion and I look forward to more insights. Ramos’ post, “<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/marketing/2008/03/b2b-lead-manage.html">B2B Lead Management Market Heats Up</a>,” is definitely worth checking out. </p>

<p>According to Ramos, there are four primary buckets of technology solutions aimed at solving the “how do I make lead generation activities more effective?” They are:</p>

<ol><li>Web analytics </li>

<li>Database services </li>

<li>Marketing automation</li>

<li>“Pure play” lead management </li></ol>

<p>With that said, I think it is important to realize that lead management software and marketing automation tools are only one part of an effective process. Here's what I've learned...</p><p>Software will not spontaneously generate collaboration between sales and marketing, nor will it create solutions that match your processes and it certainly will not generate sales-ready leads on it’s own. However, for many the allure of easy execution and fast results are difficult to resist. It’s easy to overlook that these systems require a great deal of hands on input and maintenance to be fully appreciated. </p>

<p>My company has spent well over a million dollars and almost ten years to develop our lead management software system that we use as part of our services and we’re learning what works (and what doesn’t) everyday through testing and trial and error. That said, I can say that developing a good process takes more time than you think and developing people to execute the process consistently is even more difficult. </p>

<p>I regularly encounter organizations that invest in expensive software before they fully understand the fundamental operational processes that it will be supporting. This was and still is true of CRM and SFA systems. Lead management software has turned out to be no different. If you want to fully leverage your lead management software, you’ll first need to develop operational discipline and focus on good execution. </p>

<p>Start by understanding your lead generation requirements and design a suitable process to support it and insert the software into the process where it will be most effective and actually used. Most importantly, don’t under estimate the need for a dedicated team of people that will drive the process and make the inputs into the system.</p>

<p>Begin by mapping out a clear process. At InTouch we use process flow and data diagrams to collaborate with clients when designing lead management programs.&nbsp; Make sure you involve and collaborate with everyone who will be part of the process. Their buy-in will be key to the programs success. Then identify if there are still any gaps in staffing. Finally, once people and process are mapped out, select the tools or systems that will help your people efficiently manage the process. </p>

<p>Lead management is the bridge between sales and marketing that connects the beginning and middle of the customer acquisition process. It requires engaged people to execute the right process, which is then supported by the right software. </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just had a great interview with Robin Carey, co-founder of the Customer Collective. </p>

<p>Salespeople have become the second choice for information among buyers who'd rather just go to the Internet. This trend actually creates an opportunity for those who think and act like trusted advisors. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecustomercollective.com/TCC/17182">You can listen here</a> </p>

<p>In the interview, I share how I got my start and how the Internet has shifted control away from marketers and salespeople. I also describe how today's sales people can add value to the buying process by becoming expert content filters for prospects. This is the key to <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2008/01/lead-nurturing.html">lead nurturing with a human touch</a>. </p>

<p>What's <a href="http://thecustomercollective.com/">The Customer Collective</a>? It's a new business outreach community for sales and marketing executives. It was built in collaboration with established media companies like Business Week, ZDNet and BNET. I see it as a social media site (that doesn't focus on social media) but rather looks at real meat and potatoes sales and marketing. We need more sites like this.</p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning I was talking to a marketing leader about his 2008 strategy and he brought up some concerns he had about the economy and its potential impact on him and others. Can you blame him?</p>

<p>In years past, marketing has been favorite target for cuts by CFOs and CEOs as they look to conserve cash and reinforce their balance sheets for tough times. </p>

<p>I’m less concerned about budget cuts and more interested in opportunities for him and other B2B marketers who choose to bring focus to their marketing efforts. We have to remember that regardless of the economy, sales people are still expected to perform. I seldom find sales quotas are lowered to fit the news headlines. </p>

<p>If you want to flourish regardless of the economic conditions, you need to look for ways to help your sales team execute and improve performance.</p>

<p>I’m convinced that one of the best ways to do that is to focus on lead generation. Yesterday, I read a Kate Maddox's article in BtoB Magazine, &quot;<a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080310/FREE/704087863/1108/FREE">IDC: Tougher times for tech marketing</a>,&quot; which supports that other B2B marketers are doing just that. </p>

<p>Much like a savvy investor who buys when the market is down, smart marketers can capitalize on this opportunity (and beat competitors), by bringing focus and attention to their lead generation efforts.</p><p>Maddox’s article highlights IDC's recent tech marketing barometer research. IDC showed that fewer tech marketers are increasing their budgets this year compared to last year. But I think the bigger story is how those dollars are being allocated. Maddox writes, “According to the [IDC] report. Lead generation is the top marketing priority for tech marketers this year…”</p>

<p>According to studies, the single biggest issue for contemporary business-to-business marketers is effective lead generation.&nbsp; Conversely, it has been pointed out that 80% of marketing expenditures on lead generation and collateral are wasted because the leads are ignored by sales people.</p>

<p>For this reason, marketers should direct their budgets away from traditional awareness building campaigns that quickly eat up budget and instead expand and <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2006/06/optimizing_lead.html">optimize lead generation programs</a> that bring measurable results. Finding better tools and processes for managing the leads or inquires that they already have is also a good investment in a turbulent economy. </p>

<p>You will optimize lead generation immediately if you can honestly answer “yes” to all of the following questions: </p>

<p>• Do sales and marketing agree on what the word “lead” means?&nbsp; <br />• Are you tracking the conversion rates of leads to sales opportunities? <br />• Can you/Do you close-the-loop on all leads that are being passed to sales?<br />• Does your sales team pass back early stage or &quot;cold&quot; leads back for lead nurturing? </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader asked me to explain why fewer leads are better and why “cost-per-lead” budgets fail. These are two great questions that have the same fundamental answer: <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2004/10/guidelines_for_.html">quality first then quantity</a>. </p>

<p>The truth is that sales people care very little about the cost of the leads we generate. What they really care about is how many of those leads will actually become viable sales opportunities. </p>

<p>For this reason, I think cost-per-lead measurements are irrelevant unless we can answer another fundamental question first, “What is our rate of lead acceptance (a.k.a. sales pursuit) into the sales pipeline” and then “What is the cost per opportunity?”</p>

<p>Sadly, I find that a lot of marketers tend focus on cost-per-lead because they really don’t know what happens to their leads after they hand them off to their sales team. This is why <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=306">closed loop feedback</a> and <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/09/lead-management.html">lead management</a> are so important. </p><p>B2B Marketers must start measuring cost-per-opportunity now! Why? It’s the one metric that can help you understand how well your sales team accepts and pursues leads.&nbsp; Ultimately, it shows if your leads are actually helping our sales team sell and if we’re positively contributing to their pipeline.</p>

<p>Lead acceptance into pipeline is primarily a function of lead quality.&nbsp; There are other influences such as sales training and refining the <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2005/05/lead_generation_1.html">lead handoff process</a>, but lead quality stands out as the single largest factor driving the real ROI of our lead generation programs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In a cost-per-lead model there is a tendency to drive down the cost of each lead by generating more leads, which is good if the quality does not suffer.&nbsp; However, this is rarely the case since there are a finite number of high quality sales ready leads in your target market at any given time. </p>

<p>The real question is, “Are these leads helping our sales team sell more and will these leads become profitable customers?”&nbsp; </p>

<p>In most cases in order to get more leads to sales (as they demand more leads now!), marketing is forced to send early stage leads, often at the inquiry stage in order to meet quota or cost per lead requirements. Of course, the need for more leads does not come with a commensurate budget increase! </p>

<p>Simply sending more leads over the fence to sales will only result in more early stage leads being lost, ignored or discarded.&nbsp; And if your early stage leads are not being cultivated with <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=316">lead nurturing</a> and given the attention they need, they will go to waste. Unfortunately in a cost-per-lead scenario this waste will not be measured, rather only your lead production costs. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that a cost focused mindset is a lot different than a value driven mindset.&nbsp; The cost focused mindset often drives decisions that are arbitrary to the objectives of a lead generation program. The most valuable leads are those that your sales team can convert to viable sales opportunities, not just leads that drive more activity. </p>

<p>Pushing more leads and creating more activity can give marketers a false sense of security in the short term, but in the long term the cycle of failed campaigns will continue as past failures are dismissed, overlooked or as fingers are pointed.&nbsp; To break the cycle, we must close the loop with sales and start measuring opportunities. </p>

<p>The following are real-world metrics that every marketer should track in their lead generation program:</p>

<ul><li># of inquiries?&nbsp; </li>

<li># of leads? (qualified as &quot;sales-ready&quot;)</li>

<li># of opportunities (leads in moved into sales pipeline)?&nbsp; </li>

<li># of closed deals from marketing leads? </li></ul>

<p>If you know those metrics you can start to track the following key performance indicators:</p>

<ul><li>Inquiry to lead ratio </li>

<li>Lead to opportunity </li>

<li>Lead to proposal ratio </li>

<li>Lead to sale (win) ratio</li></ul>

<p>A value driven mindset requires leaders and marketers to plan and budget for the long term and to take a more holistic view that goes beyond cost-per-lead budgets. Cost-per-lead budgets are irrelevant unless you can first measure cost-per-opportunity or cost-per-lead-pursued and lead quality is a key driver in insuring that those leads are pursued. </p>

<p>What do you think about cost-per-lead budgets or sending fewer high quality leads to sales people?&nbsp; </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrying on the theme of my recent post on <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2008/01/lead-nurturing.html">lead nurturing as trusted advisors with the&nbsp; human touch</a>, I came across Mike Volpe's post over the <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/3881/Inbound-Lead-Nurturing-Relationships-not-Emails.aspx">HubSpot Marketing Blog</a>. I thought he did a nice job of showing the human touch in action as part of the lead nurturing process. </p>

<p>The goal of lead nurturing is to maintain a relevant and consistent dialog with viable future customers - regardless of their timing to buy. It’s about relationships. As you <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/3881/Inbound-Lead-Nurturing-Relationships-not-Emails.aspx">read Mike’s story</a>, you'll notice how he helped “Kristen” move through her buying process not by selling but by seeking first to be a relevant resource to her. </p>

<p>Lead nurturing requires a shift away from the traditional marketing mind-set to a new way of thinking centered on the following tenets:</p>

<ul><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Companies don't buy - people do. Don't ever forget the human touch.&nbsp; </div></li>

<li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Build relationships with the right people and companies regardless of their timing to buy.&nbsp; Engage these people early in their buying process (preferably before) and you can co-create and influence their vision.</div></li>

<li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Trusted advisers win more sales than slick brands. </div></li>

<li>More ROI is reaped from the patient tending of future customers (relationships) over time. Think: customers for life. </li>

<li>Lead nurturing is a conversation, not a series of disjointed campaigns.&nbsp; </li>

<li>A <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2005/03/lead_generation_1.html">multi-tactic</a> and multi-touch lead generation portfolio will always outperform marketing tactics that stand alone. </li>

<li>Generate <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/08/content-ideas-1.html">relevant content</a> that engages the right decision makers/influencers.</li>

<li>The first impression matters.&nbsp; So does the second.&nbsp; So does every single touch after that.&nbsp; Consistency and relevancy is key. </li></ul>

<p>If you keep these ideas top of mind, the way you nurture leads will naturally go beyond just e-mail. You’ll start thinking about how you and your sales people can be a relevant resource. When you do that, you don’t have to sell to people. They will come to you first when they are ready. Again, it’s about relationships.</p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you don’t have time to search though multiple blogs I recommend you check out <a href="http://alltop.com/">Alltop</a>. The site was launched by marketing wiz, blogger, author, entrepreneur &amp; venture capitalist <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>. </p>

<p>What's different about Alltop? It’s really a selection of the top 50 RSS feeds (i.e. mostly blogs) in 20 categories. All that information is collected listed in a single page. Personally, I’m finding Alltop useful for keeping up with other topics I'm interested in but don't want to spend a lot of time on. </p>

<p>The small business section includes the B2B Lead Generation Blog along with publications like Fast Company, Entrepreneur, Forbes and some of my favorite bloggers like <a href="http://sellingtobigcompanies.blogs.com/">Jill Konrath</a>, <a href="http://www.lonelymarketer.com/">Patrick Schaber</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, <a href="http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/">John Jantsch</a>, and <a href="http://www.lipsticking.com/">Yvonne DiVita</a>. </p><div class="feedflare">

<title>How to make B2B marketing messages more memorable</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In B2B marketing, when you have many potential buyers who are involved in the buying process, how do you connect with these people in a memorable way?</p>

<p>If you look at most lead generation messages, they often contain industry jargon and abstract ideas. Interestingly, that’s part of the reason many of them don’t work. </p>

<p>Our future customers are weary of messages, pitches, hype, buzzwords, and corporate speak, that they quickly forget them. So how do you create marketing and lead generation messages worth remembering? </p><p>According to this <a href="http://www.itsma.com/NL/article.asp?ID=380">ITSMA interview with Chip Heath</a> author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400064287/startwithalea-20"><em>What Makes Things Stick</em></a>, we need to overcome the curse of knowledge. </p>

<p>Heath say’s, “B2B marketers have a very high standard of communication that they have to impart. A group of psychologists and behavioral economists has called this ‘the Curse of Knowledge.’ As we become experts, it becomes harder to imagine not knowing what we know.”</p>

<p>In other words, as we develop our individual areas of expertise and live it out in our companies, it actually makes it harder to communicate with those outside out company. This could be part of the reason some might struggle explaining their job (i.e. what you do) to family and friends. </p>

<p>Heath’s focus is on this idea of “stickiness” he found that for our ideas to stick in people’s minds, they must be concrete. But the reality is that most of our business language is far from concrete. </p>

<p>I've summarized the 6 themes that Heath covers in his book that are consistent with sticky ideas: </p>

<ol><li>Simple - get to the essential idea, the most important idea should leap out</li>

<li>Unexpected -blast preconceived notions causes people to stop, think and remember </li>

<li>Concrete - use real-world analogies to simplify complex ideas </li>

<li>Credible - do you have a <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=7643">trust worthy</a> reputation? If not, people will ignore you. </li>

<li>Emotional - people often decide based on emotion and backfill with logic</li>

<li>Stories - we're wired to pay attention to stories and stories can be retold</li></ol>

<p>I found this related MarketingProfs article, &quot;<a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/Tutorials/macinnis1.asp">How to Use Imagery to Create Memorable Messages</a>&quot; by professor Debbie MacInnis interesting. MacInnis describes new research about combining concrete words with imagery to make more memorable branding messages and “the power of the internal movies that consumers generate themselves.” Please note: this article was written from a B2C perspective but as I think about it I see B2B applications too.</p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s surprising how many marketers now say they do “lead nurturing” but in reality they are just sending monthly email campaigns or monthly newsletters with some call to action. </p>

<p>If all you do is send generic email marketing messages to your early stage leads over and over and over again, you’re missing the point. Consistency is good but being relevant and then consistent is even better. </p>

<p>To be truly effective, marketers must get over the “automated only” approach to lead nurturing (meaning there's no actual human interaction just a blind system that can't think). The point of nurturing is to build relationships and to do that we need to have a dialog between people that’s relevant and consistent. We need the human touch. </p>

<p>I was <a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2008/01/lead-nurturing.html">interviewed</a> on the subject of lead nurturing by Jon Miller, VP of Marketing at <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a> and he writes the <a href="http://blog.marketo.com/">Modern B2B Marketing Blog</a>. </p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2008/01/lead-nurturing.html">&quot;Lead nurturing with Brian Carroll&quot;</a></p>

<p>In the interview we discuss the importance of the human touch in lead nurturing, the best ways to encourage early stage leads to start an active buying cycle, and the ROI of thought leadership. </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s commoditized business climate I think what sets companies apart with a complex sale is how well they build and cultivate relationships. </p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve observed a truth; and this truth will requires many sales people to reconsider how they think selling should be done. </p>

<p>The truth is, average sales people think they are most effective when they talk with someone WHEN they are ready to buy, but top performers seek to build relationships with the right people in the right companies BEFORE they're ready to buy.</p>

<p>This is where marketing can have a profound impact by helping their sales team <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/03/drive_your_lead.html">go beyond the lead</a>. </p>

<p>Today’s prospects have a general lack of trust and they simply don’t want to be sold. They are weary of pitches, hype, pushy sales people and manipulative marketing tactics. They are time constrained and too busy to think or strategize. So what do they do with most sales and marketing messages? They simply ignore them.</p>

<p>For this reason, I think it’s critical to contact and have initial conversations with our future customers that are devoid of sales pitches.&nbsp; Quite literally when we begin a conversation with them, their attitudes and beliefs are being shaped, primed by the information they have already soaked up through various sources.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Be a resource to them regardless of their timing to buy. Otherwise, they are likely to get information from the internet or uninformed colleagues, trade publications or heaven forbid your competitors. In other words, we need to move from lead generation campaigns to conversations. </p>

<p>Sellers can make the biggest impact early on in the buying process, or before it happens by developing relationships with potential clients and becoming a trusted advisor. The best way to do this is by starting with what we call the “human touch.” A personal phone call to the right person that is free of sales hype is the best way to build relationships that lead to positive sales results. </p>

<p>Relationship building with prospects is part of the overall <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=316">lead nurturing</a> process. </p>

<p>The goal of lead nurturing is to maintain a relevant and consistent dialog with viable leads - regardless of their timing to buy - until they are sales ready. A key aspect of lead nurturing is the ability to provide <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2005/06/using_thought_l.html">valuable education</a> and information to prospects up front. In this way you will be able to position yourself as a trusted advisor and perhaps even a thought leader. </p>

<p>I was honored to speak at the Jill Konrath's <a href="http://www.salesshebang.com/">Sales Shebang</a>. Jill posted a summary of what I shared on the <a href="http://sellingtobigcompanies.blogs.com/selling/2007/11/sales-shebang-l.html">Selling to Big Companies</a> blog. It includes specific tips on how you can leverage thought leadership to win more sales with lead nurturing. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you plan on entering the world of podcasting or want to make yours better, you can read what I’ve learned in my MarketingProfs article, &quot;<a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/7/b2b-lessons-learned-from-podcasting-carroll.asp">Lessons Learned from Podcasting</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Similar to blogging, podcasting is a medium that B2B marketers remain on the fence about. Are they worth the time investment? Should you start a podcast to generate leads? I would say probably not, at least if that’s your only motivation. </p>

<p>Podcasts work because they have an appeal of authenticity. There is power in the human voice. And that’s why they are a great way to positively inform and educate your audience. If that’s a goal you have, then read on. </p>

<p>Think of podcasts as content pieces to use as part a <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=162">lead nurturing program</a>. If you’re going to start podcasting don’t just do one and see what happens. A good podcast requires a commitment to do more than one to build your audience.</p>

<p>Here are some podcast ideas you can try: </p>

<ul><li>Ideas or tips of the day, week or month</li>

<li>Talk radio complete with topic and call-in listeners </li>

<li>Short interviews with thought leaders and industry experts</li>

<li>Recording speeches, webinars or teleconferences for later distribution</li>

<li>Promote an upcoming event by giving a preview of the speaker or content</li></ul><p>I’ve done a number of podcasts and learned that my listeners don’t have time for 20 minute podcasts. For future podcasts, I’m going to break them into shorter bite sized segments. Also, I’m exploring some technologies that allow smart tagging of audio so people can skip ahead or click into the specific audio content they believe is relevant.&nbsp; Any suggestions here would be welcome. </p>

<p>Did you know that most people don’t listen to podcasts via MP3 players? The majority still listen from their desktops instead. That’s a good thing if your using them for lead nurturing. We’ve found that sending links to the podcast audio file via email (as part of a nurturing program) along with a short message is an effective way to reach more listeners. </p>

<p>Ultimately, your reasons for podcasting may be to use your content for lead generation, but I urge you to begin with a heart to make a difference with your audience. If you begin with that in mind, your efforts to inform and educate will be obvious and you’ll increase the odds that your audience will keep listening. </p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started the <a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/">B2B Lead Generation blog</a> back in 2003, my purpose was to have this blog be a launch pad for practical ideas, not commercials. So that’s why many of you probably don’t know what I do in my day job as CEO of <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/">InTouch</a>. But today I’m making an exception.&nbsp; </p>

<p>After a long partnership with MarketingSherpa as a featured speaker and presenter at their B2B marketing summits, we made the decision to be acquired by MECLABS Group, the parent company of <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/">MarketingSherpa</a> and <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/">MarketingExperiments</a>. <a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/in-the-news.html">Read the press release</a>.</p>

<p>With this acquisition, nothing will change for InTouch clients, future clients, partners and employees. We'll keep our name, our staff, and office in Arden Hills, MN. I along with our executive team will stay intact and we will continue to focus on building the company.</p>

<p>I often talk about the need for a “human touch” in marketing to overcome this age of automation and depersonalization. I fervently believe the only way to drive sales is to feed this need for relationships. </p>

<p>What exactly does InTouch do? We’re a professional B2B contact center that provides clients with the essential human touch required to develop and convert more leads into sales. </p>

<p>At age 24, I started InTouch (then Carroll Communications) back in 1995 out of my apartment living room with a second hand computer and $350 (I’m not kidding). At the time, I hoped to make a living while making a difference with how companies acquire and grow customer relationships through B2B telemarketing. </p>

<p>In 1999, we acquired one of our clients with which we had developed awfully good synergies, iNETech, an IT consulting Services Company specializing in software application development and I gained two great business partners, Pat Lorch and Brandon Stamschror. The new name of the firm, of course, was InTouch.</p>

<p>Since then, our company has been executing lead generation programs designed to profile sales prospects, uncover viable opportunities and create demand. Core services include: <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/services/teleprospecting.asp">teleprospecting</a>, <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/services/lead-qualification.asp">lead qualification</a>, <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/services/lead-nurturing.asp">lead nurturing</a>, <a href="http://www.startwithalead.com/services/lead-management.asp">lead management</a>, and marketing automation tools. Peg Davis over at <a href="http://www.marketingexperimentsblog.com/internet-marketing-news/welcome-intouch-inc-our-new-demand-generation-and-lead-management-experts-07-07.php">MarketingExperiments blog</a> wrote a great post that explains more. </p>

<p>That’s why all of us at InTouch are excited about tapping into MarketingSherpa’s practical case studies and know how, and MarketingExperiments’ online laboratory to discover what really works. Together, we can profoundly change the way people think about lead generation for the complex sale. </p>

<p>Plus, now our research for you will be supplemented by the team at MEC Labs Group. They run an actual laboratory facility in Jacksonville Beach, FL, where they conduct live campaign experiments in partnership with folks such as The New York Times and Reuters. </p>

<p>I want to sincerely thank you all of you for reading this blog. I have learned so much from your comments and our conversations. This blog will continue. And I look forward to us learning, doing and sharing together what really works for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071458972/startwithalea-20">lead generation for the complex sale</a>.&nbsp; </p><div class="feedflare">
