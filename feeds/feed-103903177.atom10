This is especially true among the &lt;a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; crowd -- Mac OS X is the preferred development platform for the Rails core group. Several counts I took at the recent &lt;a href="http://railsconf.org/"&gt;RailsConf&lt;/a&gt; showed that &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twylo/173895378/"&gt;Mac laptops&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/6/26/2057869.html"&gt;outnumbered&lt;/a&gt; Wintel/Lintel ones by a &lt;a href="http://patrickcrosby.com/blog/?p=36"&gt;nine-to-one ratio&lt;/a&gt;; some people have &lt;a href="http://www.economysizegeek.com/2006/06/24/macs-at-railsconf/"&gt;suggested that the ratio is larger&lt;/a&gt;. (In fact, after the Mac, the next most popular machine seemed to be the Nintendo DS.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement should boost its rep among developers even more: &lt;a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/7/ruby-on-rails-will-ship-with-os-x-10-5-leopard"&gt;Rails will ship with both the client and server editions of OS X 10.5, a.k.a. "Leopard"&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what the &lt;cite&gt;Riding Rails&lt;/cite&gt; blog has to say:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The developer seed that was distributed today at WWDC contains Ruby 1.8.4 and Rails 1.1.2, but we fully expect to have Rails 1.2.x along with Mongrel, SQLite bindings, and lots of other Ruby goodies on the final gold master when it goes out in spring.

I imprinted immediately, and I was onboard with that wonderful application from 4.0 all the way to 6.5. Somewhere around 7.0, though, BBEdit began to lose the plot. Its transition to OS X had always seemed halfhearted, and all those buttons for generating HTML were looking very quaint. The menus and preference dialog had grown unwieldy, almost byzantine.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To make a &lt;a href='http://e-scribe.com/news/134'&gt;long story&lt;/a&gt; short, after trying everything under the sun (really; I don't think there's a single native editor for OS X that I didn't fire up at least once), I switched to &lt;a href='http://textmate.org/'&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago and am completely sold. It consistently works the way I want it to work and leads me to discover features I didn't know I needed. Its bundle system solves the cruft problem that's killing BBEdit, and provides an organized, accessible way for users to expand the app's featureset. It's a Cocoa app with a good native feel. I even &lt;b&gt;bought it,&lt;/b&gt; which is a remarkable thing for a cheap, indecisive, open source guy like me to do.</description><link>http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2005/11/digging-textmate.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (pbx)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3267908.post-113182344579958168</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2005 19:21:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2005-11-12T11:24:05.813-08:00</atom:updated><title>PowerBook hibernation</title><description>Andrew Escobar has posted an informative page on &lt;a href='http://www.andrewescobar.com/archive/2005/11/11/how-to-safe-sleep-your-mac/'&gt;enabling the new "Safe Sleep" mode&lt;/a&gt; that Apple made public (quietly) with the release of the latest PowerBooks.</description><link>http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2005/11/powerbook-hibernation.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (pbx)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3267908.post-113174281441699256</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2005 20:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2005-11-11T13:00:28.986-08:00</atom:updated><title>Looking at Buying a PowerBook?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;John Gruber does an &lt;em&gt;very detailed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/11/full_metal_jacket"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of his newly acquired 15" PowerBook.

Spotlight may not be the key to world peace, but at least Apple provides &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/spotlight.html"&gt;a way&lt;/a&gt; to get your special file format indexed.  Wouldn't it be nice if Software Update allowed a way for developers to register their app so that users could be notified through a unified interface?  Yes, I know there are apps from various mac update sites that do something very similar to this.  This would be much simpler for the user, even if it does put a little more load onto the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess it would be similar to how Windows Update knows about a few of the non-Windows components on your system (video, nic drivers, etc) only better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2005/10/idea-for-software-update.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Propeller Head)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3267908.post-112991190981987538</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2005 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2005-10-21T09:25:54.413-07:00</atom:updated><title>Aperture</title><description>By now you've heard about &lt;a href='http://apple.com/aperture/'&gt;Aperture&lt;/a&gt;, Apple's new pro-level imaging app. Is it iPhoto on steroids?  iView on crack?

It has the concept of "categories" locally, which correspond to labels on the gmail side.  Why they don't just say "labels" is beyond me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But what doesn't it do?  It does not act as a mounted drive like it's Windows and Linux counterparts.  It's not a huge deal, and I'm glad something like this finally came out for OS X.  But, and you knew it was coming, it's just one more app that has to be launched.  Having file system integration saves you that much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found via &lt;a href="http://digg.com/apple/Mac_users_can_now_use_Gmail_for_storage."&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt; (which is the new slashdot, and by "slashdot" I mean "annoying community-driven site").&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2005/10/gdisk.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Propeller Head)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3267908.post-112829505066325404</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2005 23:10:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2005-10-02T16:17:30.673-07:00</atom:updated><title>Real Player direct-ish download</title><description>I needed to install Real Player on my new PowerBook and remembered something about the BBC making the whole process less bothersome. After some Googling and testing I ended up with &lt;a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/categories/plug/real/newreal.shtml?intro2'&gt;this link to the BBC site&lt;/a&gt; as the most direct entry point. From there you click on the Mac OS X download link, which takes you to Real's site where you choose a mirror.  

If you try to simply use the URL from the Mac OS X download link alone, referrer checking on Real's site will throw you back to the main Real download page and will subject you to all their silly info-gathering.</description><link>http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2005/10/real-player-direct-ish-download.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (pbx)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>97</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3267908.post-112792524865458602</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2005 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2005-09-28T09:34:08.736-07:00</atom:updated><title>Adium instead of iChat</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get sucked into Apple's applications that come with OS X, particularly when you compare them to the lame ones that Microsoft includes with XP. But there are ones that are better.
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't all that keen on using IM a few years ago, but it was convenient for a few friends I had. When I first launched iChat, I was quite impressed. I've been using it a few years, and became surprisingly fond of it.
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/09/20/Messaging"&gt;Tim Bray recommended Adium&lt;/a&gt;, and I took a look at it. In short, if you like iChat but don't use the voice capabilities, you may love &lt;a href="http://adiumx.com/"&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt;. You can make the contacts window much more compact, you can have all your chats in one tabbed window, Adium integrates many more IM services than iChat, and you can change the color schemes easily. If you have a long list of chat partners on different services, Adium will cause you to remove iChat from the dock.</description><link>http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2005/09/adium-instead-of-ichat.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Paul Hoffman)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>7</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3267908.post-112776357059448390</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2005 18:59:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2005-09-26T12:39:30.693-07:00</atom:updated><title>Unix for Mac OS X Tiger</title><description>Now available: &lt;a href='http://twoalpha.blogspot.com/2005/09/unix-for-mac-os-x-tiger-book-released.html'&gt;Unix for OS X 10.4 Tiger: Visual QuickPro Guide, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt; by Matisse Enzer, published by Peachpit Press.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ScreenCastsOnline and MacTV have posted a great &lt;a href="http://live.watchmactv.com/?p=61"&gt;screencast that demonstrates some of the wonders of LaunchBar&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a &lt;a href="http://toolbot.com/about/launchbar.php"&gt;longtime fan and user of LaunchBar&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be hard to evangelize because it's so unlike anything most users know. (Spotlight has changed that a bit, but that's a post unto itself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the use of the Keyboard Viewer was particularly clever. When the utility you're demonstrating has "Keep your hands on the keyboard" as its motto, just following the mouse won't do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the screencast, Tom gives a 20% discount code for any LaunchBar orders made until November 30th, 2005. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
