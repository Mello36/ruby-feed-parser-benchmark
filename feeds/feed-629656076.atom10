			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>SECOND UPDATE as of Dec. 10th:</strong> WHOOPI GOLDBERG has it RIGHT! Today on The View, she stated that Oprah needs to take her thyroid problem SERIOUSLY!! Contact the View about STTM and the seriously correct treatment <a href="http://abc.go.com/daytime/theview/ask">here.</a></em></p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE as of Dec. 10:</strong> Gail King, Oprah&#8217;s best friend, was on the Good Morning America show this morning talking about Oprah&#8217;s weight gain and thyroid problem. She also talked about how depressed she looked.  Oprah, a huge and growing body of thyroid patients are all around the world, waiting to tell you what the answer is.  Listen to us.  We have been emailing you for years, and you&#8217;re going to see more of those emails. Contact Good Morning America <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Site/page?id=3271346&amp;cat=Good%20Morning%20America">here.</a> (Then contact Oprah below)<br />
</em></p>
<p>Just on the stands, Oprah&#8217;s January issue of &#8220;O&#8221; magazine has an eye-opener: Oprah Winfrey admits that she&#8217;s now back up to 200 lbs, a condition that puts her at higher risk of several chronic conditions, including diabetes and heart disease.  She states <em>&#8220;When it comes to maintaining my health I didn&#8217;t just fall off the wagon. I let the wagon fall on me.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>But what Oprah, a wonderful talk show host and chairman of  Harpo, Inc, doesn&#8217;t seem to get is that the &#8220;wagon&#8221; is probably a &#8220;poorly treated&#8221; hypothyroid condition, which causes a lower metabolism and easy weight gain.  She even admits in the article that she deals with an out-of-balance thyroid condition which has made her develop a &#8220;fear of working out.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>A fear of working out?? </em>Oprah, do you get exhausted from working out? Because there is NOTHING to fear with working out if you are optimally treated with natural desiccated thyroid in the presence of strong adrenals or adequate treatment.</p>
<p>Are you on desiccated thyroid, Oprah?? Are you dosing high enough to remove all symptoms?? Have you learned what <a href="/things-we-have-learned/">patients have learned</a>? And what condition are your adrenals in, Oprah?? Because it&#8217;s all too common for thyroid patients to have developed <a href="/adrenal-info/">adrenal fatigue</a> from being poorly treated for so long.</p>
<p>And Oprah, when you state that you don&#8217;t need to be thin, but do want to be &#8220;strong, healthy and fit&#8221;&#8230;the way to do that is optimally treat your thyroid! We are a large and growing body of patients worldwide who have done just that, and now live &#8220;strong, healthy and fit&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>IT IS TIME FOR <a href="/media/">JANIE</a> TO BE ON YOUR SHOW, OPRAH. (Thyroid patients even have a <a href="http://www.laughinggrapepublishing.com">book</a> you can recommend to others.)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because in all due respect to your personal trainer Bob Greene and Dr. Mehmet Oz&#8230;y</strong><strong>ou have YET gotten someone on your show who can give you GOLD about the right thyroid treatment.  Call me, Oprah.  Email me, Oprah.  I am waiting to tell you how to stop your yo-yo weight problems and fear of working out!  We and I have a LOT to tell you, Oprah, to stop your own personal thyroid madness. Contact Oprah <a href="http://www.oprah.com/contactus">here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Send a message to Oprah&#8217;s best friend, Gayle King, <a href="https://www.oprah.com/plugform.jsp?plugId=497">here</a>.  Tell her about desiccated thyroid and YOUR story. Send Gayle to this website so she can understand all this.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mouth just fell open last night.</p>
<p>Apparently, in December of 2002, an Australian doctor named JP Walsh (Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia), and an Endocrinologist to boot, wrote an most interesting article in the journal <em>Current Opinion in Pharmacology</em>.</p>
<p>This incredibly stunning article was titled <strong>Dissatisfaction with thyroxine therapy — could the patients be right? </strong></p>
<p>The abstract states:</p>
<p><em>In some patients with hypothyroidism, symptoms of ill health persist despite thyroxine treatment. It is unclear whether this arises from comorbidity or because standard thyroxine replacement is in some way inadequate for some individuals. Some patients feel better if they take a slightly excessive dose of thyroxine, but this carries a potential risk of adverse cardiac and skeletal effects. There are conflicting data on whether combined thyroxine/triiodothyronine treatment is preferable to thyroxine alone in dissatisfied patients </em></p>
<p>I am unable to read the full article, as it is required that you pay a sum I don&#8217;t have. But you definitely get the impression that this doctor was on the cusp of figuring out what we have known solidly all along.  Because Dr. Walsh, the patients WERE right, and still are.  Synthroid, Levoxyl, Eltroxin, levothyroxine and all other T4-only medications suck, and have sucked for a long, long time.  <a href="/t4-only-meds-dont-work">www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/t4-only-meds-dont-work</a> and  <a href="/long-and-pathetic/">www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/long-and-pathetic</a></p>
<p>I so hope to be able to contact Dr. Walsh.  Do you know him?  Because he and I need to have a long talk.</p>
<p>Janie</p>
<p>p.s. Thank you Gerry.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh jolly.</p>
<p>Diane, a thyroid and adrenal patient, informed me of a recent visit to a local Endocrinologist.  The doc stated that she was on a committee that is working with the FDA to do away with saliva testing, strongly proposing that it&#8217;s not accurate testing and is &#8220;harming&#8221; people.</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s see. For a couple of years now, thyroid patients who strongly suspect they have adrenal fatigue by the reactions they have to desiccated thyroid have been using saliva testing&#8230;and lo and behold,  <strong><em>the results they receive nearly completely conform with how they feel! </em></strong> i.e. saliva testing, which tests one&#8217;s cortisol levels at four key times during a 24 hour period,  has worked beautifully in helping thyroid patients with adrenal fatigue identify their problem, in helping these patients doctors have a better understanding of their problem, and knowing better what might be their best treatment, which can range from using licorice root, to over-the-counter adrenal support, to hydrocortisone (HC).</p>
<p>Harmful?? Give me a break. (And why are we not surprised this is coming out of the mouth of an Endocrinologist.)</p>
<p>Could it be that medical school trained doctors just<em> hate and despise</em> any method which a patient might benefit from WITHOUT going to the doctor and paying big bucks??  hmmmm.  And once again, could it be that a method NOT taught in medical school just MIGHT be a good one (just as desiccated thyroid like Armour, Naturethroid, etc. is far, far better than Synthroid or Levoxyl, which ARE taught in medical school)?</p>
<p>The FDA approved saliva testing for AIDS in 2005. They approved saliva testing for ovulation in 2003. They approved saliva testing to detect if a woman is going into premature labor in 1998. And there&#8217;s many more they have approved.  So&#8230;perhaps this is all a gasp of a committee who hates to see patients have some control over their health (terrible, awful thing, isn&#8217;t it?) or the cry of a committee that only reveals its ignorance.</p>
<p>p.s. Dr. Best of San Antonio recently posted the following excellent article on saliva testing: <a href="http://besthealthandwellnessinfo.com/hormone-testing-i-spit-on-your-blood-test/">http://besthealthandwellnessinfo.com/hormone-testing-i-spit-on-your-blood-test/</a></p>
<p><strong>HO! HO! HO! <a href="http://www.laughinggrapepublishing.com">Laughing Grape Publishing </a>will send the STTM book for you to a loved one or friend for the holidays!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thyroid patient from the UK, and a member of <a href="http://www.thyroiduk.org/">Thyroid UK</a>, reminded me of the ongoing travesty in the UK concerning the TSH lab test. And I thought it was worth revisiting due to its extreme absurdity. Quoting from <em>www.brf-thyroid </em>under FAQ, then Hypothyroidism, then Treatment:</p>
<p><strong>The most sensitive indicator of developing hypothyroidism is a rise in the TSH result. Generally a TSH result of &lt;5 is regarded as biochemically ‘normal’, a result of 5-10 is borderline and a result of >10 (in a patient who is not acutely ill) is regarded as consistent with hypothyroidism. The biochemical results have to be considered along side clinical symptoms, and together they determine the point at which the physician will introduce Thyroxine therapy. </strong></p>
<p>Yikes. 5-10 is only BORDERLINE hypo?? What planet to they live on?? I have come across MANY thyroid patients on internet groups who have had a TSH below 3 with RAGING hypothyroidism, and for YEARS being told they were normal. Never, ever has the TSH been a &#8220;sensitive&#8221; indicator until it finally rises enough to reveal it&#8230;.but that can be YEARS in the making, and the patient is now living with <a href="/adrenal-info/">adrenal fatigue</a> to further complicate their ongoing hypothyroid condition. The <a href="/tsh-why-its-useless/">TSH lab test</a> does NOT work. </p>
<p>Then from <em>http://www.british-thyroid-association.org/Guidelines/</em>, and downloading the 2006 <em>final version of the UK guidelines for the Use of Thyroid Function Tests </em>, and reading 3.2.2, comes this:</p>
<p><strong>The decision on treatment of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism should be guided by repeated TSH measurements. When TSH is elevated but &lt;10 mU/L there is no consistent evidence of an association with symptoms, secondary biochemical abnormalities (hyperlipidaemia), cardiac dysfunction or cardiac events.</strong></p>
<p>No consistent evidence of an association with symptoms?? Then what ARE those symptoms that thyroid patients have experienced over and over and over, even with a TSH as low as the 2&#8217;s??? And repeated TSH measurements?? There is a huge body of thyroid patients across the world who have had years of a NORMAL TSH yet raging hypothyroid symptoms. </p>
<p>They also add:<br />
<strong>There is evidence of improvement in the lipid profile and symptoms when patients with modestly raised TSH (mean 11.7mU/L) were rendered euthyroid with thyroxine</strong></p>
<p>Calling anyone &#8220;euthyroid&#8221; (normal thyroid-wise) on a <a href="/t4-only-meds-dont-work/">T4 med</a>, with an average TSH of 11, is so laughable that it stands on its humorous own.  </p>
<p>The Dark Ages persist in the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism. What a shameful, blind-sighted travesty! Are you from the UK and dealing with the backwardness? Talk to us by replying to this blog (and be patient&#8211;comments don&#8217;t always show up quickly.). </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was informed today that a very popular and well-liked doctor in Texas, who treats many hypothyroid patients, was disciplined recently.  And for what?  Under the column titled NONTHERAPEUTIC  PRESCRIBING, it states:  <em>The action was based on Dr. Launius’ prescribing Adipex, Adderal and Armour Thyroid to patients when such medications were not indicated.</em> <a href="http://www.tmb.state.tx.us/news/press/2008/101608a.php">www.tmb.state.tx.us/news/press/2008/101608a.php</a></p>
<p>Adipex and Adderol are both central nervous system stimulants, and I can&#8217;t comment one way or the other. But the mention of Armour thyroid as &#8220;not indicated&#8221; is potentially worrisome, especially with similar disciplinary actions brought upon well-liked and wise doctors like Peatfield and Skinner of the UK, Derry of Canada, and  Springer in the US&#8211;all who dared to make obvious <em>symptoms</em> more important than ink spots on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Take Kymm, a 45 year old woman.  She has manifested hypothyroid symptoms for 15 years since the birth of her daughter.  Yet during those entire 15 years, her TSH lab result has been completely &#8220;normal&#8221;&#8230;i.e. hypothyroidism has never been &#8220;indicated&#8221; based on the typical and widespread gold standard of diagnosis: the TSH.  But she has never, ever been normal with 15 years of easy weight gain, chronic depression, thinning hair, rising cholesterol, and other clear hypothyroid symptoms. And she <em>has</em> in fact started on Armour&#8230;and is soaring.</p>
<p>Kymm is not an oddity.  Thyroid patients on internet groups report going years with a normal TSH, no diagnosis, yet clear symptoms which are ignored by their TSH-obsessed doctors.   So their doctors may have avoided disciplinary action, but did they truly practise the art and science of healing??</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How many doctors can I strangle with my bare hands?? Grrrrrrrrrrr. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Today, I am once again appalled and saddened by the endless body of thyroid patients who continue to plummet into the abyss of adrenal fatigue, day after day after day.  And it just never needs to happen if doctors would simply <em>pay attention </em>and be <em>informed</em>. </strong></p>
<p>Belinda is the perfect example.  She didn&#8217;t participate in thyroid patient groups anymore, living her life happily, because she thought her post-RAI thyroid treatment was under control, being on 2 grains of Armour for a year.  But suddenly, she felt the need to return to her groups and seek feedback. Because she has become more irritable and moody, has a hard time falling asleep, and feels frequently anxietal. Labs are redone, and she finds herself with a slightly over-range free T3 and a very suppressed TSH.  Her doctor decides to lower her thyroid meds, which in turn improves her insomnia and anxiety, but weight starts piling on. She&#8217;s confused and wonders how she can find her balance between <em>being on too little</em> with unwelcome weight gain and <em>being on too much</em> with uncomfortable anxiety and insomnia.</p>
<p>What Belinda didn&#8217;t get, and what her doctor didn&#8217;t get, is that Belinda had now joined the dubious camaraderie of those with <a href="/adrenal-info/">adrenal fatigue</a>, a needless condition of over-stressed and under-functioning adrenals. As a result, T3 in Armour starts to pool in the blood, causing anxiety, insomnia, and all sorts of low cortisol symptoms. Thyroid patients just like Belinda have to first discover what is going on, then face the complicated balancing act of <a href="/adrenal-info/how-to-treat/">treating adrenal fatigue</a> AND hypothyroidism.  <em>And it&#8217;s a path that never needed to happen. </em></p>
<p>WHAT IS POTENTIALLY TAKING <em>YOU</em> DOWN THE DIRTY-YELLOW BRICK ROAD TO ADRENAL FATIGUE??</p>
<p><strong>1) Being <em>undiagnosed</em>, or being <em>dosed by</em>, the faulty TSH lab test and its dubious &#8220;normal&#8221; range, which will leave you with lingering hypothyroid symptoms. (Belinda&#8217;s 2 grains tells me she was being dosed by the TSH)<br />
2) Being treated by T4-only medications like Synthroid, Levoxyl, Eltroxin, et al, which end up teasing your adrenals to work harder to take up the slack of an inadequate treatment.<br />
3) Lowering your expectations of what &#8220;normal&#8221; is. No, it&#8217;s not normal to have less stamina than others, to be on an anti-depressant to bandaid your hypo depression, to feel colder than others, to require frequent naps, to feel the need to avoid people, to be bothered by lights or noises, to be told by those you love that you are too defensive or over-reactive&#8230;and so on. </strong></p>
<p>I hope anyone reading this comes to an understanding that you canNOT enter your doctor&#8217;s office as if you are entering the throne of a god. Your doctor, no matter how educated or dedicated, may not have a strong understanding of the role of adrenal function in relationship to bad treatment via T4-only meds or the TSH lab range.  You may have to bring this knowledge to your doctor, or find another one who is either learned, or open-minded. Because your chances of having adrenal fatigue are huge if you are on T4, if the TSH is worshipped by your doctor whether on T4 or desiccated thyroid, or if you keep walking into the doctor&#8217;s office and hang your own knowledge on the hook outside his or her door.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who, as a smoker, hasn&#8217;t heard how deleterious tobacco smoking is for your health.  Not only will you acquire health problems directly related to smoking, but your life is shortened by 10-15 years average according to statistics. My own father died at age 63 <em>directly </em>related to his smoking.</p>
<p>But in spite of strong reasons to quit, most smokers will tell you it&#8217;s NOT easy. Why? Because the nicotine in tobacco is the <strong>addictive bogeyman</strong>. Nicotine stimulates those pleasure centers in your brain, besides being a substance which &#8220;gets you going&#8221; by releasing both blood sugar and adrenaline. The American Heart Association states that &#8220;Nicotine addiction has historically been one of the hardest addictions to break.&#8221;<br />
<strong><br />
But for hypothyroid patients, tobacco smoking presents another whammy.</strong> Namely, it stresses your adrenals over and over. And with adrenal fatigue being a common side effect of treating hypo with T4 meds like Synthroid, Levoxyl, Eltroxin, et all, as well as being dosed by the lousy TSH, you&#8217;ve got a third reason to fall into adrenal fatigue if you are a smoker.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally, another factor in the difficulty of quitting is that cortisol <em>decreases</em> when you try to quit.</strong> A <a href="http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/2/299">2006 research</a> report found that the lowered cortisol after quitting is <em>associated with smoking relapse and with reports of increased withdrawal severity and distress.</em> So, when you already have adrenal fatigue, and you quit smoking&#8211;a double whammy against being successful.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the solution? </strong> If you don&#8217;t have adrenal fatigue and want to quit, it may be wise to have a good adrenal support on hand, such as Isocort or any quality OTC adrenal product at your health food store. If you DO have adrenal fatigue, staying away from cigs may require adding additional cortisol to your daily amount.  Chapters 5 and 6 in the <a href="/book/">STTM book</a> have good information to help you with cortisol support.</p>
<p>Are you a smoker with hypo? Don&#8217;t hesitate to respond to this post with your experience. (Please note that replies are not for questions.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The topic of iodine supplementation for your overall health has been growing the past few years among patients, especially in light that many of us may be low in iodine, or just the fact that iodine has anti-cancer qualities. I became interested in the topic after reading Dr. David Derry&#8217;s book <em>Breast Cancer and Iodine</em>. I&#8217;ve also seen the testimony of several women with Fibrocystic Breast Disease who saw it disappear once they started iodine supplementation. Impressive!</p>
<p>And since thyroid hormones are primarily composed of iodine, thyroid patients are listening to and questioning the use of iodine supplementation.  Yahoo Groups has an excellent <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/iodine/?yguid=279936468">iodine group</a> now led by Stephanie, where you can ask questions and decide for yourself. Also, if you google &#8220;iodine&#8221;, you&#8217;ll find much to read. </p>
<p>But <strong>thyroid patient Mike Lawson </strong>came up with some very interesting facts this week about iodine in desiccated thyroid&#8211;just one more reason to consider using Armour, Naturethroid, Westhroid or other desiccated thyroid products! He figured out the below: </p>
<p><strong>T3 = C15H12I3NO4 = molar mass of 650.9776<br />
T4 = C15H11I4NO4 = molar mass of 776.87</p>
<p>Iodine has a molar mass of 126.90</p>
<p>Iodine content of T3 = (3 * 126.9)/650.9776.  T3 is 59.725 % iodine.<br />
Iodine content of T4 = (4 * 126.9)/776.87.   T4 is 65.339 % iodine.</p>
<p>Armour has 38 mcg T4 &#038; 9 mcg T3.<br />
.65339 * 38 mcg = 24.828 mcg iodine<br />
.59725 * 9 mcg = 5.37525mcg iodine</p>
<p><em>So, each grain of Armour has 30.20325 mcg iodine. In other words, each<br />
grain of Armour has 1/5 the RDA of iodine (150 mcg).</em></strong></p>
<p>Very interesting facts, Mike!  Sure, some thyroid patients feel they need more than what desiccated thyroid offers. But it&#8217;s a good start when so many individuals feel their own iodine levels are too low, and need help, especially those who have had to deal with thyroid or breast cancer, or have a family history of it. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I called Rhea on the phone today. </p>
<p>Earlier today, Rhea was in the one-operator beauty salon at the same time as my 90 year old mother-in-law: one getting her gray hair dried while the other got her grayer tresses rolled. And as conversations go in beauty salons, it turned to personal topics (which can range from one&#8217;s marital happiness to whether Mrytle&#8217;s boobs are real or expanded.) And one of those topics was about Rhea&#8217;s <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> as well as her daughter&#8217;s. </p>
<p>And of course, my very doting mother-in-law mentions the <a href="http://www.laughinggrapepublishing.com">STTM book</a> written by her daughter-in-law, Janie, and hands her a copy from the car.  Long story short&#8230;Rhea wants me to call her.</p>
<p>The phone conversation went into the fact that she used to be on Armour, but then listened to a local doctor several years later who switched her to Synthroid&#8211;&#8221;a far more stable medication&#8221;.  (not) Since she switched, she says she&#8217;s felt terrible for years, and has recently returned to Armour, and with the vast information in the book, understood now how she needed to raise.<br />
<strong><br />
And then came the shocker: THE DOCTOR WHO PUT HER ON ARMOUR WAS BRODA BARNES. </strong></p>
<p>My eyes got as big as fiesta dinner plates and I exclaimed &#8220;<strong>THE</strong> Broda Barnes??&#8221;  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I saw him in Loveland, Colorado and he was a darling man.&#8221; She proceeded to tell me that when doctors entered the room back then, you stood. And she remembers his wife being there, and being just as sweet as he. She recalled him saying that when he was in medical school, he was disappointed when the professor assigned him to study the thyroid gland. &#8220;Such a little puny gland&#8221;, he thought. &#8220;But today, 50 years later, I still have so much to learn about that little gland.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know the name of Broda Barnes, he was the father of the desiccated thyroid movement and an authority on the thyroid. Even back then, he knew of the superiority of desiccated thyroid treatment like Armour, and prescribed it. He also wrote the classic <em>Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness. </em> His book and legacy kept the idea of Armour and desiccated thyroid alive all these years later when we, as patients, were paying attention. </p>
<p>Rhea is now up to 4 grains Armour and feeling much better, and may have to go a little higher before she&#8217;s optimal.  <strong>Thank you, Rhea, for giving me and anyone reading this a little peek into the wonderful Broda Barnes. </strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received a reply to a post below that I was unable to approve because it mentioned someone by name. And the reply was not particularly friendly, and definitely not accurate. lol. But the reply brought up some good issues, which I have no problem addressing.<br />
<strong><br />
Namely, can I agree that there are some people who do well on T4-only treatment such as Synthroid or Levoxyl??</strong> I can&#8230;sorta.  I have a friend whose husband is one of those seemingly lucky individuals on T4, with no thyroid, who leads a fairly active and happy life. Considering how lousy I did, he amazes me.  But I did notice something else about him: <em>he has high and rising cholesterol and is on statins.</em> That&#8217;s a classic symptom of a poor treatment and continuing hypothyroid, even if he does have much better energy that I ever did. </p>
<p>And by observing him, and knowing a few others who subjectively feel they do well on T4, I came to the following conclusion: <em>though some may do better than others on T4, I have yet to find anyone on T4 who doesn&#8217;t have some kind of side-effect of a poor treatment, whether they are treating it with statins, treating it with antidepressants, or not treating it at all &#038; denying it. </em> Sure, some may do better than others, but the proof is in the pudding if you look deep enough. And, at the very least, I&#8217;m just plain suspicious that ANYONE on T4, even doing <em>subjectively</em> well, is going to have symptoms of a poor treatment creep up on them as they age. The body was not designed to live on conversion alone.<br />
<strong><br />
Can I agree that some people just canNOT tolerate desiccated thyroid like Armour and need to be on T4? </strong>  Initially, that may be. The gal that wrote me stated she felt a lot better on T4, and that no matter what she did, she couldn&#8217;t tolerate Armour. I believe her. If Armour was that miserable, she should be on T4 for the time being, or even better, a synthetic T4/T3 combination.  But I also believe that even if she feels she did everything to a &#8220;t&#8221; and still couldn&#8217;t tolerate it, there was more for her to learn that she didn&#8217;t get the first time around when it came to her adrenal fatigue treatment. I see it too many times. And perhaps, over time, it will become more clear.  </p>
<p><strong>Do some proponents of desiccated thyroid go overboard in their fervor?</strong> I don&#8217;t doubt it one bit. We&#8217;re human. And we hope you are forgiving. But once you get past however you view are communication shortcoming, do know that our fervor is based on the fact that a huge volume of individuals are having lives changed due to desiccated thyroid (and/or treatment of low ferritin, and/or treatment of adrenal fatigue). And it&#8217;s too widespread and global not to have fervor, besides common sense that a treatment that gives us back what our own thyroids would be giving us is just plain remarkable. </p>
<p><strong>So, do know that if you are on T4, and feel well, I&#8217;m behind you. It&#8217;s your life, not mine, and I believe you. But neither can I stop my belief and too many observations that if you are truly hypothyroid and <em>need </em>treatment, desiccated thyroid is a superior choice, now or later, whether you are lucky enough to have escaped adrenal fatigue, or whether you have a challenging case of adrenal fatigue that <em>can</em> be adequately treated! </strong></p>
