			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>I just found out about TechCrunch50, Can I still apply?</strong><br />
Technically, yes, you may still fill out an application.  However, priority will be given to companies who applied on or before our June 27 deadline and we do not guarantee your application will be reviewed.<br />
Please go <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2008/submit-your-company/">here</a> for Rules and Qualification.</p>
<p><strong>Where do I go to fill out an application?</strong><br />
You may visit our application site <a href="https://app2you.com/apps/2008tc50/submit_company_application" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/app2you.com');">here</a>.   You may save your application in draft mode before sending, then later submit and update your application.  </p>
<p><strong>I didn&#8217;t receive an e-mail confirmation stating TechCrunch received my application, did you get it?</strong><br />
A separate e-mail confirmation was not sent out.  There was an electronic confirmation posted after you hit submit. </p>
<p><strong>After submission, can I make changes to your application?</strong><br />
Yes, but the changes should only be to your contact information or you &#8220;Demo Login.&#8221;  Please post demo details at least 1 hour prior to your appointed time.</p>
<p><strong>When will Early Consideration applicants be notified?</strong><br />
We hope to notify Early Consideration applicants by Friday, July 18.</p>
<p><strong>*UPDATED*  When will Regular decision applicants be notified?</strong><br />
Due to overwhelming application response, we will notify Regular decision applicants by MONDAY, August 11.</p>
<p><strong>I submitted my company Early Consideration, but got an e-mail saying I&#8217;m being moved to Regular Consideration. Why?</strong><br />
Even if you selected &#8220;Early Consideration&#8221; on your application, if you submitted your application after Saturday, June 14 deadline your application was moved to the Regular decision group.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWS</strong></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve submitted my company, what next?  </strong><br />
The process of review begins!  First, we make sure your company qualifies and fits the TechCrunch50 criteria.    (For example not launched, little press coverage, etc.)  Next, we invite you for Round 1 interviews.  These are 10 minute &#8220;Power&#8221; Interviews where you demo your unique technology to one of our Reviewers.   Those invited to continue to Round 2 will have a second look with a different Reviewer in the same 10 minute format.  Finally, in Round 3 we select our Semi-Finalists.  Here we invite you back for a 20 minute in-depth interview where we get to know more about you and your product.  From Round 3, we select our Finalists for TechCrunch50.   </p>
<p>Companies will be group notified of their status periodically during the process.  All companies will receive notice by their notification date.</p>
<p><strong>In Round 1, how should I structure my 10 minute demo?</strong><br />
The entire 10 minutes should be used for your demo presentation.  If there is additional time, your Reviewer may take a few minutes to ask a few questions before wrapping up.   We wish we could spend more time with you but we have HUNDREDS of applications to review, thus we apologize that we simply cannot. </p>
<p>In your interview you may lead the Reviewer verbally through your demo site, guide them via web conference, etc.  conference, etc.   Please be prepared to show your technology.  Have your screenshots, web conference (adobe connect, gotomeeting) or video presentation ready to go when the Reviewer calls. It doesn&#8217;t have to be highly produced, just please no &#8220;pure&#8221; Powerpoint presentations.  Powerpoints with screenshots and video demos embedded are acceptable.</p>
<p>Remember, the 10 minutes go by very quickly so practice your demo, cover all your the important parts, and make the best case possible for why you&#8217;re the next big thing!</p>
<p><strong>Where do I post my demo information?</strong><br />
Place all demo instructions and current contact information on your Application under the &#8220;How to Access your Demo&#8221; section.  You may login to your application <a href="https://app2you.com/apps/2008tc50/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/app2you.com');">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please DO NOT e-mail us your Demo information!  It must be centralized on your application so all Reviewers can access.</p>
<p><strong>How do I contact the interviewer?</strong><br />
You will not contact the Reviewer. </p>
<p>Rather, the Reviewer will be contacting you at the phone number placed on your application at the scheduled time.  They will not call you before hand.  They may send an e-mail to give you a status update in the event of a time delay or need to reschedule.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t want to be contacted at the phone number on my application?  Can the Reviewer contact me on Skype or by cellphone?  </strong><br />
If you wish to use an alternative number, skype, conference line or web conference, please set up the account and let us know the login credentials or meeting ID by updating your application under &#8220;Demo Login&#8221; at App2You.  Please post the information no later than 1 hour prior to your appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Is a web conferencing service, like Adobe Connect or gotomeeting required? </strong><br />
No, it is not required but has worked well in the past demos.  Whatever service or presentation method you use, please make sure it is both Mac and PC compatible. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Didn&#8217;t the interviews used to be 15 minutes?</strong><br />
The demos have always been 10 minutes.  We have minimized the Reviewer&#8217;s post Q&#038;A so we can get through more demos.  </p>
<p><strong>REVIEWER CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the Reviewers looking for in a company demo?</strong><br />
They will be looking for the next big, disruptive technology idea.  They consider things like:<br />
1. How innovative the idea is?<br />
2. How good is the execution?<br />
3. How likely is it that the product and company will succeed?</p>
<p>Our Reviewers and panel are more interested in what unique product or service you bring to the table; and less interested in who you are, where you come from, or who are your financial backers. </p>
<p><strong> Have more questions? Leave a comment, and we will add them to the FAQs. </strong></p>
<p>7/29/2008 UPDATES</p>
<p><strong>Does everyone receive an interview (assuming you meet the basic criteria - not launched, no press) or is there a subjective review before the interviews?</strong></p>
<p>If your company has met the basic criteria, and submitted their application on time, you will be interviewed.  All Round I invitations will be sent no later than Friday, August 1st.</p>
<p><strong>When does one hear about Round 1 interview? Also, do you inform the companies that did not make it and why?</strong></p>
<p>Companies hear about Round 1 interviews on a rolling basis.  We will inform every company as to whether they made it or not, but due to the volume of applications we cannot provide feedback as to why.</p>
<p><strong>From what I understand, if a company wishes to receive early decisions by Friday, July 18…does that mean they have already gone through the three rounds of selection?</strong></p>
<p>All early consideration applicants have been notified as of the week of July 25th, 2008. If you are an early consideration company, and have not heard from a member of the TechCrunch50 staff regarding you application please e-mail schedule@techcrunch50.com</p>
<p><strong>Will all interviews have been conducted by the decision dates (July 18/ Aug 1) or is that when the interviews begin?</strong></p>
<p>All interviews will be conducted by the decision date. We have moved the regular decision date to Monday, August 11 and the early decision announcements were delayed till Tuesday, July 22.</p>
<p><strong>How much warning are interviewees given, so that they can prepare their presentations?</strong></p>
<p>Interviewees select their own interview time, so how much time they have to prepare depends on which slot they pick. This also ensures that the interview is conducted at time that is mutually convenient for both the interviewer and the interviewee.  Most companies receive a minimum of 24 hours notice, so please be prepared to select a time and demo at your soonest convenience.</p>
<p><strong>We have been having several questions about the demo. The interviewer will call the interviewee(s) at the appointed hour at the contact phone number given on the application</strong></p>
<p>All Reviewers share the information posted on your Application that is why we have you post your contact and demo information online to your application.  Make sure the data is uploaded at least 1 hour prior to the demo.</p>
<p><strong>I want to add an extension number to the phone number I posted on my application, I am having trouble finding the ‘demo login’ section of my application….any suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>For any changes to the contact information provided on your application, please post the changes to your application under “How to Access my Demo” section which is a free form writing area.  Again, make sure it is at least one hour before the time that the interview is scheduled for. </p>
<p><strong>How is the demo conducted?</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, your product is feature complete or near feature complete and you can give the interviewer a guided tour, either online, or using Adobe Connect. If Adobe Connect is not working for you, please use WebEx or gotomeeting. If this is not possible, a taped demo, or other walkthrough is acceptable. Remember this is all about the product, so starting with Powerpoint slides describing the market size, corporate background, and founder bios is not necessary for your demo. </p>
<p>Please have a conference call number setup, or a direct landline so we can contact you.</p>
<p>Please be in a quiet location to do your demo, we do not suggest using a mobile phone or speakerphones that echo. We want to be able to hear each of your words clearly!</p>
<p><strong>I am having trouble finding the ‘demo login’ section of my application….any suggestions</strong></p>
<p>The ‘demo login’ is known on the application as: ‘How to access your demo.’   </p>
<p>To locate, login to your account at App2You to access your application details.  Click ‘edit’ it will be the 3rd section on your application.  Place any and all pertinent information in this area: web conference details, preferred contact method or other special instructions.</p>
<p><strong>If notified, when is the final date one can have a 1st round interview? (By or before August 1st, etc…?)</strong></p>
<p>We are closing out the final Round 1 interviews for TechCrunch50’s regular consideration. Final invitations to round I will go out by August 1st.  The last dates for Round I demos is shortly thereafter. We cannot give a hard final deadline for when first round interviews are over, as it depends on our interviews availability.</p>
