<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/heinz.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22" title="Heinz Tomato Soup" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/heinz.jpg" alt="Leave it to a tomato soup company to inform you that Most husbands, nowadays, have stopped beating their wives..." width="500" height="606" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Heinz Tomato Soup: </strong>Leave it to a tomato soup company to inform you that &#8220;Most husbands, nowadays, have stopped beating their wives&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/hardsheworks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25" title="PEP Vitamins" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/hardsheworks.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="441" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. PEP VItamins:</strong> In order to get women to take better care of themselves, the geniuses at PEP suggest that the harder you work, the cuter you&#8217;ll be.  If that&#8217;s the case Crystal Meth should replace plastic surgery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blowsmoke.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26" title="Tipalet Cigarettes" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blowsmoke.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="441" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Tipalet Cigarettes: </strong>I don&#8217;t know what the fuck a &#8220;Tipalet&#8221; is, but apparently you can blow it in some hot chicks face and she won&#8217;t smack you.  In fact she&#8217;ll &#8220;follow you anywhere&#8221;.  Where are these women today?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/calcofrowmen1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31" title="Calculator for Women" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/calcofrowmen1.jpg" alt="" width="373" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Casio Calculator: </strong>What we have here folks is a calculator for women.  Why would you need a calculator for women?  Apparently the women of the 1940&#8217;s and &#8217;50&#8217;s were total dipshits who couldn&#8217;t take the top off of a bottle of ketchup let alone add a pair of numbers on a manulator.  Big ass number keys, just like a baby toy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/spank.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30" title="Chase &amp; Sanborn Coffee" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/spank.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="416" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Chase &amp; Sanborn Coffee: </strong> Wow. This one doesn&#8217;t mess around.  No ambiguity here, listen up housewife, if you bring home some crap coffee he&#8217;ll beat you.  Scare tactics the Bush administration would be proud of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/illegaltokill.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28" title="Pitney Bowes Postage Meter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/illegaltokill.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>6. Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter:</strong> I can&#8217;t really make out what&#8217;s happening here but it&#8217;s clear from the headline that if &#8220;the woman&#8221; screws with your postage, settle down.  Take a deep breath, regroup, and try not to murder it, I mean her.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/doormat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29" title="Mr. Leggs Pants" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/doormat.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>7. Mr. Leggs Pants: </strong>Hahaha.. sorry.  This one is so offensive even I was like &#8220;whoa.. hey, what the hell is going on here&#8221;.  Ok here&#8217;s the deal.  Mr Leggs slacks are so pimp, she&#8217;ll let you walk all over her.  You&#8217;ve got to appreciate the foot on the head, which really drives the message home.</p>

</ul>
<p>If the city you live in sounds like a medieval disease, a curse word, or a spell casting goblin, its time to throw your wife in the car, toss the kids in the trunk and get the fuck out of Dodge. These words aren&#8217;t meant to be used to name cities. Here are some better uses of some of these words.</p>
<p><em>Man, I told my son if he came home with an F again, I&#8217;d send his ass to <strong>Aptos</strong></em><em>!</em></p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;re going to have sex with Nancy, you better use protection. Mike told me she gave him <strong>Graeagle</strong></em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Dude, I found the sickest costume for Halloween. I&#8217;m going to go dressed as a fuckin <strong>Turlock</strong></em><em>!</em></p>
<p>Leaving these cities shouldn&#8217;t be hard. 95% of the residents in these cities already have houses with wheels attached to them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently ordered some RAM from newegg. Newegg is pretty great at getting good shit at reasonable prices. They are located across the street from where I work. I ordered this RAM on Wednesday. There is no reason it should take more than one day to put some computer components in a box, and ship them out across the fucken street. Wrong. Its Friday now, and my RAM is nowhere to be found. Understandably, I&#8217;m a bit disappointed. So I dig up their email and find a &#8216;Live Chat&#8217; button. So I fill out my info and a new little window opens up, awaiting a representative. Below is the actual conversation.</p>
<p>All Newegg representatives are currently assisting other customers. Thank you for your patience. An agent will be with you shortly.</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Newegg. My name is Maverick. How may I assist you today?</p>
<p><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong><span><em>Hello.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>I ordered some RAM on line.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>It hasnt got here yet.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>I&#8217;m across the damn street from you guys!<br />
</em><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong><span><em>WTF?<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>Let me look into this for you.  One moment please . . .<br />
</em><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong><span><em>Sure<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>This is on a 3-7 business day ship. The Item should arrive no later than the 16th.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Thats cute, but usually i order from there and i get it next day.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Is there a way I can pick this up at the building?<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>I do not show this was selected on a next day.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>The order has unfortunately already shipped.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>We actually do not have a will-call or pick-up area available presently for customers; all orders must be shipped.  Unfortunately at this time we cannot allow any exceptions, and do apologize.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>I never select next day. Im located across the fucken street. i choose normal ground, and i get it next day<br />
</em><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong><span><em> <img src='http://www.angryrobot.tv/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>and the tracking number that was provided doesnt work.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Says &#8217;shit not found. invalid number&#8217;<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>I would recommend a next day or a ground shipping could be selected for the next order. There seems to be issues currently reading the tracking information on the site I apologize we are looking into the issue.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Goose or Ice Man cant help me out? I&#8217;d even settle for Viper.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>So theres no way to get a proper tracking number?<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>I show that although the tracking isnt confirming on the site this is the correct tracking number generated on the warehouses end.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Hmmm no chance this RAM got lost in &#8216;the Danger Zone&#8217;?<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>I wouldn&#8217;t think so If the item was in fact lost in transit and didnt arrive by that date a claim for a refund or a replacement can be issued.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Ok. Just thought maybe someone was playing vollyball in jeans and forgot to ship it out.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>I understand.<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can assist you with today?<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>No. Thanks for everything Maverick. Time to buzz the tower!<br />
</em><span><strong><em>AngryRobot: </em></strong></span><em>Thanks man!<br />
</em><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong><span><em>LOL<br />
</em><span><strong><em>Maverick: </em></strong></span><em>Thank you for contacting us. I hope you have an Eggcellent day!</em></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Thanks again for contacting Newegg. Once you know, you Newegg.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Here is a map of the transit time. Keep in mind that transit time was 6 days!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/Newegg_transit.jpg" alt="Newegg Transit map" /></p>
<p>Need more proof? BAM!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/Newegg_map.jpg" alt="Newegg distance map" /></p>
<p>Your honor&#8230;&#8230;.. I rest my case.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the wake of allegations that text messaging could be at the core of the Los Angeles Metrolink train crash that killed 25 people in Chatsworth, a new ban on texting while driving will go into effect on January 1.</p>
<p>The bill has been signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and bans receiving, sending and reading text message on electronic devices while driving. California thus joins a small, but growing, list of states that are putting the brakes on text messaging while driving.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sick of one idiot who fucks up royally, and screws it up for everyone else! So this guy was texting while driving a train and manages to hit an oncoming train. They blame texting for the crash. Now people are crying like a bunch of whiny pussies about the dangers of texting. I would like to bring up a small issue people seem to be overlooking. Its 2008, we don&#8217;t have any kind of system that can warn us of when 2 fucking trains are going to crash? A buzz? A flashing red light? We can put a man on the moon, but we can&#8217;t get some sort of warning system for trains?</p>
<p>Other idiots that screw it up for everyone are kids today. When I was a kid all our toys were heavy, made of metal, and had lots of small parts. Some kid gave you shit, you can take one of these toys and ruin his shit with it. Today all the toys are oversized and made with space-age plastic. All this because some asshole put a toy in his mouth and choked. Well I hate to break it to you people, but if that kid wouldn&#8217;t have choked on that toy, he would&#8217;ve ended up sticking his hand in a blender, or sticking his head in an oven.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/voltron.jpg" alt="Voltron" /></p>
<p>Another incident involving some dipshit kid from Florida.</p>
<blockquote><p>The family of a 7-year-old boy in Sanford who was rushed to an emergency room after he accidentally swallowed his &#8220;grill&#8221; &#8212; or decorative metal mouth piece &#8212; is concerned because the apparatus remains in his stomach. His mother said she regrets purchasing the grill and warned other parents to beware of the hazard they can present.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry Ma&#8217;am, the only danger is giving your retard son anything smaller than the size of his mouth. How about you give him some plastic bags to play with!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when magic was cool? A magician would perform everything from card tricks to making tigers disappear. Where has all the magic gone? We&#8217;re left with a bunch of hacks and talentless douchebags. Enter David Blaine. 1997 releases <strong>David Blaine: Street Magic</strong>. Awesome. Had a lot of promise. He opted to ditch the stage and put magic in peoples faces! Pretty cool. Then, his next few tricks were a bit controversial, and by controversial I mean the kind of controversy I flush down the toilet!</p>
<p>April 5, 1999 he releases <strong>Buried Alive</strong>. <em>He&#8217;s entombed in an underground box under a 3 ton water-filled tank for 7 days in NYC.</em> This one didn&#8217;t really piss me off&#8230;&#8230; just kind of left me with a &#8216;what the fuck?&#8217; feeling.</p>
<p>November 27, 2000 releases <strong>Frozen in Time</strong>. <em>He stood encased in a massive block of ice located in Times Square. He stayed in that box of ice for 63 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds.</em> This one pissed the shit out of me. Next time, lock yourself in your freezer, dick stick!</p>
<p>May 22, 2002 releases <strong>Vertigo</strong>. <em>A crane lifted Blaine onto a 90 ft. high and 22 in. wide pillar in NYC. He remained on the pillar for exactly 35 hours.</em> A 5.4 earthquake could&#8217;ve turned Blaine into a crap-cake.</p>
<p>September 5, 2003 releases <strong>Above the Below</strong>. <em>Blaine spends 44 days sealed inside a transparent plexiglass case suspended 30 feet in the air in London, consuming no food and drinking only 4.5 liters of water per day.</em> Real good David. This one reminds me of another stunt thats been going on for years in Ethiopia, except this one uses water tainted with malaria. No points for originality, dickhead!</p>
<p>May 1, 2006 releases <strong>Drowned Alive</strong>. <em>Blaine was submerged in an 8 foot sphere in front of Lincoln Center in NYC for 7 days and 7 nights, using tubes for air and nutrition.</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/aquaman.jpg" alt="Aqua Man" /></p>
<p>November 19, 2006 releases <strong>Revolution</strong>. <em>Blaine would be shackled to a rotating gyroscope. His goal was to escape from his shackles after the gyroscope had been spinning for 16 hours. The gyroscope was hanging above an empty lot in Manhattan, near Times Square.</em> This one had all the intensity of a geriatric shitting himself.</p>
<p>September 18, 2008 releases <strong>Dive of Death</strong>. <em> Blaine was to hang upside down without a safety net for 60 hours above Central Parks Wollman Rink. When the &#8216;Dive of Death&#8217; took place, Blaine came down from a platform on a cable, and lightly touched the stage. He was then pulled back up into the air. The finale was not well-received by spectators. </em>Ok, this one has to be the cherry on the shit-sundae.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/David_Blaine.jpg" alt="David Blaine" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s two things I&#8217;ve realized from all this. One, is that the lameness of David Blaine&#8217;s stunts is growing at an exponential rate. And Two, that the air in NY is filled with the bacteria &#8216;Retardus Maximus&#8217;. This shit wouldn&#8217;t fly on the West Coast. The only trick he really mastered was how to take a perfectly good hour, and completely ruin it. I would like to see him perform a stunt called &#8216;Plane of Death&#8217;. Where he rides a paper airplane straight to the sun!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I get an email from Wells Fargo today. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> By using your <em>Wells Fargo</em> check card, you&#8217;ve earned enough points for one of these great rewards</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>$5 Amazon.com gift certificate.</li>
<li>$5 Cash Reward.</li>
<li>$5 Panera Card from Panera Bread</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm. Which to choose? Let&#8217;s take this email apart. Great, as defined by Websters, means &#8216;unusually or comparatively large in size or dimensions&#8217;. If there was a &#8216;rewards&#8217; spectrum, these would be on the OPPOSITE side of great. They would be under the words <strong>meager</strong>, <strong>puny</strong>, or even <strong>shit</strong>! As of 09/10/08, Wells Fargo&#8217;s market value was up to $111 Billion, and they are still reluctant to give rewards worth anything. Here are some other equally shitty items that Wells Fargo can offer.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The Wells Fargo Exclusive Member Mork &amp; Mindy Matchbox&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/Mork_Mindy_matches.jpg" alt="Mork and Mindy matchbook " /></p>

<p>So I don&#8217;t get what all this hype is around Patrick Dempsey. Hollywood heart throb? I prefer pretentious douche bag! He may be having his 15 minutes of fame on Greys Anatomy, but as soon as they&#8217;re done, he&#8217;s going to be right back where he came from&#8230;&#8230; spending his summers mowing lawns, and pulling Ronald Miller scams. It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that Patrick tried to buy his way into being popular, by buying Cindy Mancini a new suede dress after she ruined her mothers. Seems he somehow bought his way into Hollywood too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/patrick_dempsey2.jpg" alt="Patrick Dempsey" /></p>
<p>It seems all the casting directors in Hollywood are smoking crack these days. Take Sarah Jessica Parker for instance, playing the love interest against Matthew McConaughey in Failure to launch? Seems they over looked one small problem. She&#8217;s fuckin ugly! I&#8217;ve seen meerkats that look prettier than she does. She looks like Nasferatu!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/sarah_jessica_parker.jpg" alt="Sarah Jessica Parker" /></p>
<p>All these mismatched movies with shitty actors. It would be like casting Screech as Braveheart, or Mike Seaver as Jason Bourne! Wake up Hollywood, and get your shit together!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So this weekend I got my next batch of movies from netflix. One of them was &#8216;Death Sentence&#8217;, starring Kevin Bacon. Yeah, I know. Kevin Bacon has to be the weirdest looking actor in Hollywood today. He looks like what I imagine would be the offspring of a zombie and an alien. Mr. Bacon has come along way since playing Ren and teaching Willard how to dance in Footloose. Anyways, the movie consisted of a business man who&#8217;s turned into a vigilante after the murder of his son. It was a mediocre film. Might have been more believable if someone other then Kevin was playing the lead role. This got me thinking of all the great &#8216;You kill my family&#8230;&#8230;I kill YOU&#8217; films that I&#8217;ve seen. Here is my top 10 list in order from least to greatest.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/Tombstone_movie_poster.jpg" alt="Tombstone Movie Poster" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Desperado</strong> - This movie followed the mysterious mariachi as he left a trail of bullets and blood all over Mexico as he looked for the killer of his lover. This movie didn&#8217;t have much going for it, except for a lot of people getting turned into pastrami.</li>
<li><strong>Road to Perdition</strong> - Only Tom Hanks can play a killer that would make you fear him, yet trust to babysit your children.</li>
<li><strong>The Patriot</strong> - How to make a &#8216;Badass&#8217; checklist.<br />
Mel Gibson? - Check.<br />
Muskets? - Check.<br />
Tomahawk? - Check.<br />
Colonial Ponytail? - Check.<br />
Attitude? - Fuckin Check!</li>
<li><strong>Memento</strong> - A guy with short term memory loss tries to track down the killer of his wife, by leaving himself clues and notes. Great movie. Do not recommend watching this movie drunk or stoned. Might get too confusing.</li>
<li><strong>The Usual Suspects</strong> - Great movie with a great cast. Keeps you guessing till the end.</li>
<li><strong>The Crow</strong> - This one was a classic way before all the Emo douche bags started cutting themselves to this flick.</li>
<li><strong>Kill Bill</strong> - This happens to be one of my favorite Tarantino films. Kick ass story, great actors, beautiful cinematography, and awesome dialogue. Kill Bill vol. 1 was great enough to pick up the slack of vol. 2.</li>
<li><strong>Gladiator</strong> - Ridley Scott is no noob when it comes to making films about people kicking ass. This quote sums up the movie perfectly. &#8221;My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, Loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius; father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.&#8221; Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job of playing the weasel Commodus. It took &#8216;Walk the line&#8217; for me to stop hating him.</li>
<li><strong>Tombstone</strong> - Numbers 9 and 10 kick ass on 2 levels, because they rocked as films AND they were based on actual events. It had an all star cast of badasses. You have Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Thomas Haden Church, Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, and even Jason Priestley. This movie could&#8217;ve been a silent film, and it still would&#8217;ve kicked ass!</li>
<li><strong>Braveheart</strong> - What other movie could have been the top &#8216;You kill my family&#8230;..I kill YOU!&#8217; movie? The answer? NONE. This is it, because when you dis&#8217; William Wallace&#8230;..you dis&#8217; yourself! Brings up a strange coincidence&#8230;&#8230;Mel Gibson + long hair = Someone you don&#8217;t fuck with.</li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I get older most of my friends are getting married and having kids. A night out on the town isn&#8217;t as easy as it used to be. There&#8217;s a plethora of problems that arise when the issue of leaving a baby behind is suggested. <em>The baby doesn&#8217;t like to be alone. The baby isn&#8217;t feeling good. There&#8217;s no one to take care of our baby</em>. Well folks, worry no more. The answer to all your problems is here. Presenting&#8230;&#8230;.the iWomb!!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/iWomb1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Exterior</strong><br />
The exterior of this wonder-egg are made of a composite plastic, which is as strong as steel, but much lighter and transparent. The materials molecular structure mimics that of the iridescent material that lines mussel and oyster shells - one of the toughest natural mineral-based materials.</p>
<p><strong>Interior<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The interior of the iWomb is lined with LZR Panels to create &#8216;Hydro Form Compression&#8217;. LZR has recently been made famous by Michael Phelps in the Beijing Olympics. The atmosphere inside the iWomb is much like a mothers womb. It is filled with a synthetic amniotic fluid that contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and electrolytes. The only difference is this fluid is oxygenated providing the baby the air it needs, as there is no umbilical chord.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Technology<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The iWomb plugs into any standard electrical outlet, and even has a state-of-the-art lithium ion battery good for 24hrs, in the event of power failure. The iWomb features speakers made by &#8216;Aqua Sounders&#8217;, allowing your baby the tranquility of listening to any songs you load in.</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">But I cant leave my baby there alone, who&#8217;s going to check on my baby?</span></em><br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.angryrobot.tv/images/iWomb2.jpg" alt="" /><strong>You can check on your baby yourself!!</strong> The iWomb is completely networkable with Mac or PC&#8217;s. You can even see what your baby is doing and check your babies vital signs in real time!</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><em>But what if my baby is uncomfortable and cries?</em></p>
<p><em> <span style="font-style: normal;">Toughen up, Wussy! I don&#8217;t know anyone that can scream, let alone cry with their lungs filled with liquid! While the goal of the iWomb was made as &#8216;the next best thing to the womb&#8217; for babysitter dilemmas, it can also double up as a great &#8216;Time Out&#8217; solution too. Your kid screwing off and out of control? Striking can leave marks, and marks raise questions. BAM, 30 minutes in the iWomb will give him the much needed &#8216;attitude adjustment&#8217;.</span></em></p>
