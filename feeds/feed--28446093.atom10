			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most brilliant things about the iPhone is the sheer ease with which you can find and install applications, including paid applications. No fumbling with your credit card, logging into Paypal, etc. Just click, enter your password, done. This simple convenience, coupled with the low price of most apps (less than $5) means that many users don&#8217;t really deliberate much before buying applications. After all, what&#8217;s a dollar here or there, especially when it&#8217;s so easy?</p>
<p>Many of the early iPhone developers have made a small fortune with simple applications, seeing jaw-dropping returns on their modest investment. We&#8217;re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars in several months by guys working out of their studio apartment. As a result, more developers have flocked to the platform in search of their own personal fortune, increasing the quantity and quality of applications on the platform. Users are happy because of the convenience and control. As Apple gets 30% of every purchase, they&#8217;re quite happy as well. It&#8217;s a win for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Facebook. With 130 million users and more than 50,000 applications, Facebook seems well-positioned to introduce a payments platform to let applications collect tiny fees for the application, premium content, special features, and subscriptions. There have been persistent rumors of such a move, but so far Facebook hasn&#8217;t released anything. Granted, the vast majority of applications aren&#8217;t worth paying for, but the makers of these apps know that and are unlikely to try and charge users. On the other hand, there is likely a class of applications that have not been developed because the free model doesn&#8217;t really work for them.</p>
<p>Even if only 10% of users ended up using the micropayment service, if they each spent an average of $5 / month and Facebook took a 30% cut, we&#8217;re still talking about $234 million / year in relatively high-margin revenue, not to mention the huge influx of applications and marketing that would occur once there was a non-advertising revenue stream available to app developers.</p>
<p>Are they just taking their time in developing this? Why <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> they do it?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day, my wife and I were out walking the dogs and we crossed a pretty major street where drivers only stop when there are people crossing. On this particular day, there was a moderate amount of traffic and as we set out across the street, several dozen cars slowed and stopped from about 40 mph, waited until we reached the other side, and then sped off. This started me thinking: how much fuel was wasted because of a simple street crossing? The energy required to stop nearly 100,000 lbs of steel and plastic from 40 mph and then accelerate back to 40 mph can&#8217;t be trivial, especially when you consider that this happens for millions of cars dozens of times every day, at pedestrian crossing, stop signs, traffic lights, etc. Couldn&#8217;t traffic systems be &#8220;tuned&#8221; for much higher fuel efficiency, by timing lights, replacing some intersections with roundabouts, and other fairly low-impact and low-cost measures?</p>
<p>It reminded me of one of my favorite <a href="http://www.autobloggreen.com/2006/12/22/ups-expects-to-save-600-million-by-favoring-right-hand-turns/">hacks</a> where UPS changed their routing software to be more efficient, including the simple idea of mapping delivery routes to favor right-hand turns over left-hand turns. As a result, UPS drivers spend less time sitting in the left lane waiting for the light to change, which saves fuel, and therefore saves money, <em>to the tune of $600 million</em>. All from a fairly minor change.</p>
<p>Obama took a lot of flack during the election season because he suggested that we would be better off encouraging Americans to get regular tune-ups and inflate their tires to the proper pressure than we would to increase offshore drilling. <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/608/">But he was right.</a> Those simple measures can improve fuel efficiency dramatically, and yet we&#8217;re focused on solving the problem through more difficult means.</p>
<p>It seems that we often turn energy efficiency into some kind of Rube Goldberg machine, focusing on giant sweeping initiatives that will be incredibly difficult to implement, rather than simple solutions we can implement right now. After all, switching from gas to a hydrogen infrastructure would be a huge task. Developing new hybrid or electric vehicles is challenging, and having them succeed in the market is harder. In the long run, those things will need to be done. But how can we hack the systems and processes in our everyday lives right now? How can we introduce minor tweaks and changes that will pay off with large results?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, after the bloodbath that October was, November could only be better. And it was. I worked very hard to stay on top of my daily habits and the results speak for themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of 20 days for my seven habits (I do them mon-fri), I did them <strong>100%</strong> of the time, up from 33% last month</li>
<li>My weekly habits were done <strong>100%</strong> of the time, up from 40% last month</li>
<li>I completed both of my monthly habits, or <strong>100%</strong>, same as last month</li>
<li>Of 23 goals for the month, I completed 10, or <strong>43%</strong>, up from 0% last month</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting all seven daily habits every day was brutal. There were numerous days where I headed out for a run after midnight or 1am, when I really wanted to just get to bed. On the goal side of things, things obviously aren&#8217;t what they should be. I got to Thanksgiving Day and I could have busted my butt all weekend and knocked a few more off the list, but I didn&#8217;t. I figured if I hadn&#8217;t worked hard all month when I should have, 43% was more accurate than 55% or something. As usual, I was about a week away from completing almost all of my remaining goals, but squeezing it in was just too much. I&#8217;ve pushed the remaining uncompleted goals out to December and I&#8217;ll be working hard to get those done this month. Here&#8217;s a sample of the goals from November:</p>
<p><strong>Completed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assemble a 72-hour emergency kit</li>
<li>Run across Golden Gate Bridge</li>
<li>Run a 10k</li>
<li>Launch BlueSwarm</li>
<li>Attend two industry events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uncompleted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run 2 miles in less than 14 minutes</li>
<li>Pay off a debt I owe a family member</li>
<li>Review and streamline finances (close accounts, cancel subscriptions, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how things go over the next month, which is packed with distractions and temptations. As always, your encouragement and advice are welcome in the comments below <img src='http://www.ryanwaggoner.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re in the middle of working out some project and process management issues for <a href="http://blueSwarm.com">BlueSwarm</a>, one of which is what platform to use for project management and issue tracking. We used <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> for awhile, which was great, but we needed something that was a bit more geared towards tracking bugs. Free would be a nice bonus. <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> seems to be the industry standard here, and a few days ago, I spent several hours trying to get Trac installed and running correctly. Getting it up and running wasn&#8217;t terribly difficult, but I was struggling to get several plugins hooked up and configured, get it working with Apache, etc. After awhile, I finally got tired of messing with it and went hunting for alternatives. One of the ones that I found was <a href="http://redmine.org">Redmine</a>, which is built in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. I played with the demo and really liked it, so I set out to get Rails installed on our server so we could get Redmine setup. Rails turned out to be less of a hassle than I had imagined it would be, which was nice. The one issue I had was that Redmine is not compatible with Rails 2.2.2, so I had to downgrade to an older version. But I got it working, got <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> working so we could use Apache as our server, and now we&#8217;re up and running. Redmine is clean, simple to use, and works great so far. I have no complaints. If you&#8217;re looking for a solid issue tracking / wiki / project management platform and you&#8217;re frustrated with Trac, give Redmine a try. I&#8217;d love to hear what you think.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alexis and I spent Thanksgiving Day with a group of friends that we&#8217;ve known since we moved to San Francisco. A friend of ours drove up from central California and joined us, and two of the couples have children. Surrounded by friends, eating good food, relaxing&#8230;one of the best days I&#8217;ve had in awhile. We had great wine, good conversation, and it reminded me of how meaningless most of the things I stress out about really are. Days like today are the ones that we remember when we&#8217;re old. It left me wanting more. More time with friends and family. We&#8217;re all so very busy and sometimes I feel like we lose the forest for the trees. In the end, the people we love are what matters, not some job, not money, not experiences. Those things are only important in the context of how they affect our relationships with the people in our lives.</p>
<p>Ok, I think that wine is still in my system and I&#8217;m rambling, so that&#8217;s it for now. <img src='http://www.ryanwaggoner.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read an interesting <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=procrastinating-again&amp;print=true">article on procrastination</a> today and I thought I would share some of my thoughts (surprise, surprise). The article covered some of the latest research regarding procrastination and why we do it, as well as techniques that might help deal with it. Nothing really new or groundbreaking, but it&#8217;s always helpful to read stuff like that, at least for me.</p>
<p>(Side note: I also found a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P785j15Tzk">pretty humorous video</a> that might help you snap out of it and realize how much time you waste avoiding just getting stuff done.)</p>
<p>Procrastination seems to be the weak link in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD method</a>. David Allen apparently assumes that we don&#8217;t get stuff done because we&#8217;re not clear on what we should do next, or because we don&#8217;t have a solid system for processing inputs and so forth. While I think that&#8217;s a big part of it, I also think that a big reason we don&#8217;t get stuff done is that we don&#8217;t want to do it. I can put all of my projects into GTD (and I do) and I can categorize them endlessly by context, level of effort, dependencies, etc, etc, but at the end of the day, I&#8217;m putting some of that stuff off because I just do NOT want to do it.</p>
<p>In addition to the techniques they gave in the book, I would add two more that I&#8217;ve found have worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commit to things by a certain date when others are depending on you to have it done. Guilt can be a powerful motivator.</li>
<li>Replace motivation with blind habit.</li>
</ol>
<p>#2 is something <a href="http://www.ryanwaggoner.com/2008/11/why-productivity-is-cyclical-and-how-to-deal-with-it/">I&#8217;ve talked about before</a>. It&#8217;s worked well for me to replace certain motivational needs with blind habits, like exercising or keeping my life semi-organized, but most of the examples given in the article are for one-off things like school projects or reports for work. How do habits help in those situations? Maybe having a habit to work on XX every day for 30 mins, where XX is whatever you&#8217;re supposed to be working on? Maybe having a habit to start something every Thursday that you&#8217;ve been putting off? What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday, I&#8217;m participating in a 10k. It will be my first organized 10k, which is one of my goals for the month. As it&#8217;s been years since I last ran that far, I&#8217;ve been working on preparing. I decided I&#8217;d better run a &#8220;practice&#8221; 10k of my own, and since I had another goal this month to run across the Golden Gate bridge, I figured I&#8217;d kill two birds with one stone. I set out on Saturday afternoon and from my office to the bridge and back to this side, 6.5 miles in all. I wasn&#8217;t tracking my time all that carefully, but I estimate it was right around an hour. I&#8217;m hoping for about 55 minutes when I run the real 10k on Sunday, but as it&#8217;s my first one, I&#8217;m not too concerned with my time.</p>
<p>The run across the actual bridge was incredible. The day was perfect: sunny, clear, and crisp. The views were amazing and I was listening to some of my favorite music. Definitely one of my favorite experiences since I moved to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a couple crummy pics I took with my iPhone:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have dreams. We all aspire and hope. But sometimes we&#8217;re too cautious with sharing those dreams and visions with others. Perhaps we fear they&#8217;ll steal our ideas. Perhaps we feel people will secretly laugh at us because they think our dreams unrealistic or our hopes naive. But mostly, we avoid sharing our dreams and visions because we do not want to fail in the eyes of others. Failure is a hard thing, but public failure is worse. We too often take the course of action that allows us to give it a shot in a way that no one knows about. That way, if we don&#8217;t make it, we don&#8217;t have to admit it to anyone else. It can be our little secret.</p>
<p>The problem with this is two-fold. First, it robs others of the ability to cheer us on, to encourage us through the rough patches, to celebrate with us when we win, and to commiserate with us when we fail. It robs us of a level of friendship and intimacy with others that only comes through vulnerability. But second, it holds us back from a great number of opportunities because the risk of public failure is great. We are soldiers at the river&#8217;s edge, desperate for the safety of the far banks, but the only way is to swim through the dark current, exposed and vulnerable. And so we retreat back to the woods, to the darkness, where no one will see us when we fall.</p>
<p>Tell someone your dream. Ask them about that idea that&#8217;s been gnawing at you. Put yourself out there. Be vulnerable. Yes, you will fail, and it will be embarrassing and humbling. But the alternative is life lurking at the edge of the shadows, never fully exposing yourself to the light, never really risking everything for your dreams. You&#8217;re better than that.</p>
<p><em>Side note: the act of writing and publishing this post was one of my little acts of public failure. My wife told me that it was &#8220;kind of lame&#8221; and she&#8217;s probably right, but I&#8217;d like to hear what you have to think, and how it could be better. In my own defense, I was pretty tired when I wrote this, and I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of fiction lately, so perhaps the imagery was a bit much <img src='http://www.ryanwaggoner.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, I know, I know, tech startups that aren&#8217;t in Silicon Valley get all miffed when you bring this up and love to point out all the successful tech startups outside the Valley. However, those five companies notwithstanding, there&#8217;s a very simple reason to be here: everyone else is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read these words before, but they finally clicked for me tonight when I went to Startup2Startup. My table had a couple of successful entrepreneurs, one of the early hires from Google, an angel investor or two, and a couple of VC guys. We all sat and talked about starting tech companies for an hour. That kind of face-time is actually not uncommon here. I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s actually not terribly difficult to get meetings with people who have done some pretty impressive things. Incredibly busy founders take time to respond to emails. You can&#8217;t swing a dead cat in any direction without hitting a couple of entrepreneurs who are working on their second or third startup. Everyone knows everyone, and everyone knows what&#8217;s going on or who you should talk to. It&#8217;s overwhelming in many ways just trying to figure out where to focus your energy. I could literally attend tech meetups, mixers, and other events every single night of the week, and probably several lunches throughout the week as well.</p>
<p>As usual, Paul Graham <a href="http://paulgraham.com/cities.html">said it best</a>. The impact of a culture focused on entrepreneurship is hard to quantify, but it pays off tremendously. Most entrepreneurs are stubborn and enjoy swimming against the current, but when you&#8217;re the only one like you, it gets very hard to figure out which way you&#8217;re supposed to keep swimming (to stretch the metaphor a bit). There&#8217;s tremendous value in having like-minded people to encourage you, to learn from, and to remind you that it can be done. You know this because they&#8217;ve done it. And when you sit for an hour and talk to them, you find out that they&#8217;re not so different from you, just perhaps a few years ahead.</p>
<p>The danger is that because you&#8217;re surrounded by so many people just like you, you tend to get locked in to thinking a certain way. That&#8217;s a real danger, and you should try and break through the bubble as often as you can. Go visit one of the states in middle America and talk to those people. They&#8217;ll help you stay grounded and help you understand what real people out there are thinking about right now and how you can reach them. But once you gather that intel, come back. Because if you want to build the future, there&#8217;s no better place than Silicon Valley.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last couple months, I&#8217;ve engaged in dozens of conversations about religion, politics, and other sensitive topics. The conversations have been online and offline and with people with whom I agree and disagree, in some cases vehemently. After some reflection, I wanted to point out a few things that I&#8217;ve learned can be helpful when approaching these kinds of issues. I&#8217;m still working on these, and my critics will be quick to tell you that I&#8217;ve still got a long way to go. They&#8217;re absolutely right. But you have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>Many will probably disagree with my fundamental premise, which is that dialogue is valuable and is the only true path to understanding.</p>
<p><strong>1. Initiate dialogue with those you disagree with</strong><br />
Far too many of us avoid talking about the deepest and most meaningful issues of life, often because we dislike conflict, we fear not knowing the right answers, or perhaps we&#8217;re afraid of offending someone. Whatever the reason, the result is that many of us live in ideological bubbles where ideas are seldom challenged and beliefs are rarely scrutinized. There are many people who harbor deep feelings of resentment and dislike, even hatred, towards people who hold opposing viewpoints on religion or politics, but they have never actually had an open and honest conversation with those people.</p>
<p><strong>2. Seek to understand the other side</strong><br />
If you approach these conversations with the goal of changing the other person&#8217;s mind, you&#8217;re almost certainly going to be disappointed. Now, I know that it&#8217;s unrealistic to go into a tough conversation on a controversial issue when you have a dearly held position and truly have an open mind. But do your best. Try and set aside the preconceived notions you have and really listen to what the other person is saying. It might not be as ridiculous as you thought. Even if you still disagree after hearing them out, you may find that you respect them and their beliefs more than you did.</p>
<p><strong>3. Find common ground</strong><br />
When going into tough discussions with people we disagree with, we tend to focus more on what we differ on than what we have in common. This is a mistake, as it sets people as enemies when they may agree on many of the most important points of their positions. A good example of this is the incredible fracturing that occurs in most major religious traditions over the most trivial minutia, despite the fact that they agree on almost all the key tenets of the faith.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep your emotions in check</strong><br />
Emotion and passion are useful, but only when they are tightly controlled. It&#8217;s natural for you to feel something when faced with things you disagree with strongly, but if you let your emotions fuel your reaction, the entire discussion will be useless, and is likely to make things worse. Be calm and rational as best you can, and if you can&#8217;t, put the conversation aside until you can. This is one reason that discussing things online or via email is often more useful; each side can take the time to think things through carefully and let their emotions settle down.</p>
<p><strong>5. Stay away from personal attacks</strong><br />
One of my favorite moments in all the debates leading up to the presidential election was when Joe Biden talked about how it&#8217;s ok to question people&#8217;s judgement, but don&#8217;t question their motives. I think this is great advice in general. The truth about liberals and conservatives is that they both love America and want to see Americans succeed and do well; they just differ somewhat about the best way to accomplish that. When you accuse someone of being unpatriotic because of a political belief, or otherwise impugn their character, you only do damage to your own credibility and character. Stick to the issues.</p>
<p><strong>6. Admit when you&#8217;re wrong</strong><br />
You don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve <em>always</em> got it figured out, right? You will be wrong. When you are, admit it, learn from your mistake, and move on. And take heart&#8230;finding out that you&#8217;re wrong is a great thing, because you&#8217;ve eliminated another incorrect belief from your worldview. Progress <img src='http://www.ryanwaggoner.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>7. Don&#8217;t get discouraged</strong><br />
The truth is that even if you follow the above (and any other great advice), you probably won&#8217;t see a lot of change in other people&#8217;s positions or in your own. People tend to hold many of these beliefs as a part of their overall identity, and getting them (or yourself) to think about them differently is challenging because they feel like they&#8217;re losing control over who they are at the core. But do not give up. I am living proof that rational discussion can change at least some minds. It may take years, but it can happen. And you might find that you change your mind on a few things, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know if you think these tips make these kinds of discussions worth having, or if you have any others to share. Post them below&#8230;</p>
