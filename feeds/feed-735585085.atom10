That is the purpose of &lt;a title="blocked::http://site.blogactionday.org/" href="http://site.blogactionday.org/"&gt;Blog Action Day&lt;/a&gt; and this year's focus is Poverty. As I think about this topic I can't help but reflect on a trip I took to Tanzania a couple of years ago. During that trip I got to see first hand what poverty really is. Driving through towns and seeing houses made of dung and cardboard, passing by children who were obviously malnourished and starving. That experience really made me feel guilty for ever complaining about anything in my life when I really am so fortunate. But there are things that YOU and I can do NOW to fight against poverty and help those in need. Here are just a few things I was able to do TODAY (in less than an hour):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleaned out my closet and donated my clothes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="blocked::http://pinkasparag.us/2008/10/07/blog-action-day-2008-poverty/" href="http://pinkasparag.us/2008/10/07/blog-action-day-2008-poverty/"&gt;Commented on this blog&lt;/a&gt; where $1 will be donated to a food bank to feed the poor &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clicked a link on &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.thehungersite.com/clickToGive/home.faces?siteId=" href="http://www.thehungersite.com/clickToGive/home.faces?siteId=1"&gt;The Hunger Site&lt;/a&gt; to give 1.1 cups of food to the hungry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donated to the &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.wfp.org/english" href="http://www.wfp.org/english"&gt;United Nations World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrote a blog post to increase awareness about poverty &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;For more ideas on what you can do check out this list for &lt;a title="blocked::http://site.blogactionday.org/poverty/fight-poverty/" href="http://site.blogactionday.org/poverty/fight-poverty/"&gt;88 ideas&lt;/a&gt; and see how you can make a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="http://blogactionday.org/js/3ddd36955df4e451e5289f2289710002ba4ae074"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/3538240637582316355/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=3538240637582316355' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/3538240637582316355'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/3538240637582316355'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/10/5-things-you-can-do-in-less-than-hour.html' title='5 Things You Can do in Less Than an Hour to Fight Poverty'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-5353211637251501369</id><published>2008-10-15T17:17:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-15T21:38:46.283-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='intel'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cisco'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='blogs'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HP'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='blogging'/><title type='text'>To Blog or Not to Blog?</title><content type='html'>With only 54 of the Fortune 500 companies blogging, this is a question still being pondered by many. Cisco, HP and Intel are in that blogging minority and &lt;a href="http://www.reemabeidoh.com/"&gt;Reem Abeidoh&lt;/a&gt; of Problogger interviewed me, &lt;a href="http://www.newcommbiz.com/"&gt;Tac Anderson&lt;/a&gt; of HP and &lt;a href="http://www.britopian.com/"&gt;Michael Brito&lt;/a&gt; of Intel to come up with &lt;a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/10/15/a-guide-to-corporate-blogging"&gt;A Guide to Corporate Blogging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://smarterwealth.net/"&gt;Ryan McLean&lt;/a&gt; commented on the post stating, "I don't think I will ever be in a fortune 500 company. But if I ever am then this post will come in handy." I agree with Reem's response that despite the company size "ultimately the process is very similar." And although I represented the Cisco blog in this interview I have helped build blogging strategies for many small companies and have followed the same process successfully. So whether you're coming from a big or small company this guide is a must read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tac, Michael and myself are also contributors to the &lt;a href="http://www.conversationsmatter.org/"&gt;Conversations Matter&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORRECTION: Reem is not a Problogger staff member, she is a Social Media Strategist for &lt;a href="http://www.outrider.com/"&gt;Outrider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/5353211637251501369/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=5353211637251501369' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/5353211637251501369'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/5353211637251501369'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/10/to-blog-or-not-to-blog.html' title='To Blog or Not to Blog?'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-415497713761770232</id><published>2008-10-11T21:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-11T21:53:02.216-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='commercial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='linux'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pc'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='parody'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='operating system'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mac'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='got linux'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='advertisement'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='penguin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='baby'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='apple'/><title type='text'>Mac, PC &amp; Linux - Parody Commercial</title><content type='html'>A parody of the Apple Mac vs. PC commercial with a guest appearance of the cutest Linux you've ever seen! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LWHmkRopv1k&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LWHmkRopv1k&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/415497713761770232/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=415497713761770232' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/415497713761770232'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/415497713761770232'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/10/mac-pc-linux-parody-commercial.html' title='Mac, PC &amp; Linux - Parody Commercial'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-3642855948085871458</id><published>2008-10-07T18:07:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-07T18:15:38.041-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing examples'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cisco'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing'/><title type='text'>Cisco Social Media Case Study - Free Webcast</title><content type='html'>In addition to all of the conferences I'm speaking at (as noted in my previous post) I just finished a live webcast that is now available on demand here.

I was a little rusty since I've been on &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;LOA&lt;/span&gt; for 2 months now (for those who may not know I had a baby girl on 8.8.08). I stumbled on a few words then to top it off the computer prompted me to restart now or later for an update and of course I &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;accidentally&lt;/span&gt; pressed now. The crowd responded with a "&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;oooh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;noooo&lt;/span&gt;" and it still took me a &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt; to realized what I had done. I tried to keep my cool and keep on going and according to this post from &lt;a href="http://www.trishalyn.com/2008/10/social-media-marketing-summit-brand-spotlight-on-cisco/"&gt;Trisha Lyn&lt;/a&gt; it sounded like I didn't do that bad (I swear I didn't pay her).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;Uunfortunately&lt;/span&gt; didn't catch much of the other sessions with the exception of of a presentation, by Tara Hunt. Her presentation, "Increasing the Social Capital of your Brand" was largely based off her book "The &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;Whuffie&lt;/span&gt; Factor" which she is expecting to be released in April. Her delivery was awesome and although the presentation was high level it sounds like it'll be a good read to reinforce the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my presentation, if you missed this conference you'll have two more opportunities to catch me. I'll be speaking at the &lt;a href="http://www.webguild.org/events/socialmedia_home_08.php?event_id=1614697733"&gt;Social Media Strategies Conference&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.sipaonline.com/Events/marketing_conf/index.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9"&gt;SIPA&lt;/span&gt; Mid-Year Marketing Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone who has seen my slides or better yet who has seen me present has comments or suggestions for improvement, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: If you're going to the &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.socialmediameme.com"&gt;WebGuild Social Media Strategies Conference&lt;/a&gt; use this discount code to save $150 "&lt;em&gt;community56&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/8873601950581089029/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=8873601950581089029' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/8873601950581089029'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/8873601950581089029'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/10/social-media-marketing-summit-recap.html' title='Social Media Marketing Summit - Recap'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-7128774982547991202</id><published>2008-09-16T20:21:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-16T21:01:47.052-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing examples'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='viral marketing'/><title type='text'>3M Goes Viral for All the Wrong Reasons</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SNB4qlq1LBI/AAAAAAAACLc/rK13fWzBelc/s1600-h/3M.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246826238948224018" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SNB4qlq1LBI/AAAAAAAACLc/rK13fWzBelc/s400/3M.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rather than paying a $2,000 licensing fee for an already viral photo, 3M decided to &lt;a title="blocked::http://consumerist.com/5050252/3m-steals-viral-image-idea-to-avoid-licensing-it" href="http://consumerist.com/5050252/3m-steals-viral-image-idea-to-avoid-licensing-it"&gt;recreate a fake watered downed version&lt;/a&gt; and call it their own.

This session focuses on measuring and monetizing social media. From a Cisco perspective one of the things we look at is increasing the overall 'share of voice' we have online. Tac from HP shares some of his successes with search engine optimization through the use of social media with their AR / PR initiatives. Michael at Intel looks at trying to apply a quantitative value to the different results they receive.

Why us? Well we all have jobs at Fortune 500 companies and our roles are focused on internal and external social media initiatives (and we all blog at &lt;a href="http://www.conversationsmatter.org/"&gt;Conversations Matter&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="http://www.1to1media.com/view.aspx?docid=31069"&gt;The interview&lt;/a&gt; which is also available as a &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1243645834/bclid1593473610/bctid1732351386?src=mrss"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, buzzing due to technical difficulties) was broken into two parts. The first part focuses on the challenges we faced when it comes to implementing social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the three of us have been practicing social media for sometime now and because we are all in positions where social media is valued in the organization, the challenges lie in the execution. How do you match the right strategy and tools to the people you are trying to reach and how do you ensure that your team is choosing to go down the social media path for the right reasons. For that Cisco has adopted &lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2007/12/the-post-method.html"&gt;Forrester's People-Objective-Strategy-Tools (POST)&lt;/a&gt; methodology (perhaps with an &lt;a href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/08/wrap-up-interview-from-forrester-social.html"&gt;extra look at the Strategy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However for the folks who aren't lucky enough to be at the next phase of adoption, I am commonly asked how I was able to get management on board to execute social media campaigns (like the&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lasandra5/leveraging-social-media-and-web-20-in-a-product-launch"&gt; ASR launch&lt;/a&gt;). And although that wasn't addressed in this podcast, I thought I'd address it here. For me the journey began with education to my team on social media and how it can benefit us to participate in 'conversation marketing.' The next phase involved testing the waters with small projects, successes of those projects led to the support of social media as a standard marketing practice with a team to support it. It's been almost a year since my team has been chartered with finding the right opportunities to engage in 'conversational marketing' through social media with our customers and we constantly live this cycle of adoption as we get deeper into social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for part two next week...&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/2714935170815790071/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=2714935170815790071' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2714935170815790071'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2714935170815790071'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/08/social-media-conversation-with-1to1.html' title='Social Media Conversation with 1to1 Media - Part I'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-7905511160112439799</id><published>2008-08-17T19:04:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-08-17T19:53:06.377-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='facebook'/><title type='text'>Same ol' Voice Brand New Megaphone</title><content type='html'>There’s a &lt;a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=67248155229&amp;amp;topic=4936"&gt;new facebook group&lt;/a&gt; trying to influence &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-and-the-marginalized/can-progressives-derail-b_b_118734.html"&gt;Barack Obama’s choice of Vice President&lt;/a&gt;. The story here is that in the old days, there really wasn’t any way for Barack Obama to get real time polling information outside of a few hundred poll calls and there certainly wasn't an effective way for a community to quickly ban together to influence such a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now there’s an outside chance 100k people might directly influence his VP pick – in real time. That’s awesome – that’s the power of Web 2.0. Other than physically assembling thousands of people for a riot or march or standing in front of Lucky's collecting signatures – how else can this number of people collectively have a voice in such a short time frame? This isn’t a petition – it’s a near real time shout. These aren’t just signatures, they’re virtual profiles that carry all the weight of an individual’s identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you wonder if we’re still not seeing the real potential of Web 2.0 technology. Imagine if at Apple they wee thinking of a new color scheme for the iPhone. Why risk screwing that up? Just ask your 100k strong iPhone facebook group what they think. This is not a random poll. These are real people who’ve proactively built connections and who have confirmed identities. In fact, with some analytics, you could dissect the demographics of your group to get a better feel for the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At no other time has it been easier to assemble a few hundred thousand like minded individuals and get heard. The question for us marketers (and in this case, Barack Obama) is: are we ready to listen?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/7905511160112439799/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=7905511160112439799' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/7905511160112439799'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/7905511160112439799'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/08/same-ol-voice-brand-new-microphone.html' title='Same ol&apos; Voice Brand New Megaphone'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-8831063166791921325</id><published>2008-08-05T22:38:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-08-06T08:59:43.002-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='forrester research'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing'/><title type='text'>Wrap-up Interview from Forrester Social Media Bootcamp</title><content type='html'>Today we had &lt;a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/"&gt;Jeremiah Owyang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/analyst/laura_ramos"&gt;Laura Ramos&lt;/a&gt; of Forrester co-host a Social Media Bootcamp at Cisco. After the event I was able to catch Laura for a quick interview (unfortunately Jeremiah had to run off to another meeting). Check it out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="350" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4pq2uTZgLIY"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4pq2uTZgLIY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;  &lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to address that last question again - should it be People-Objective-Strategy-Technology (&lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2007/12/the-post-method.html"&gt;POST&lt;/a&gt;) or People-Objective-Technology-Strategy (POTS)? Laura's response sounds logical and seems to be what everyone who responded to my Tweet agrees with but I'm still not convinced. In talking with Jeremiah about it one thing he said was that “strategy” and “technology” actually go hand-in-hand with some overlap. For example if your planning process led you to creating a blog the strategy that you put together would be very different than if you were creating a Facebook group. Perhaps the right methodology is POSTS so you can revisit the strategy after you've chosen the technology?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: For more on the bootcamp read this post from my collegue at Cisco, Brian Ellefritz - "&lt;a href="http://b2bsocialmedia.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-first-social-media-bootcamp-and-it.html"&gt;My first Social Media bootcamp, and it didn't even hurt&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/8831063166791921325/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=8831063166791921325' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/8831063166791921325'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/8831063166791921325'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/08/wrap-up-interview-from-forrester-social.html' title='Wrap-up Interview from Forrester Social Media Bootcamp'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-2979540617167637245</id><published>2008-07-01T16:50:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-06T21:42:07.222-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing examples'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networking'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cisco'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='visual networking'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing 2.0'/><title type='text'>Marketing 2.0 with Visual Networking</title><content type='html'>&lt;a title="blocked::http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_networking"&gt;Visual Networking&lt;/a&gt; is yet another web 2.0 marketing tool I’ve added to my virtual briefcase. Visual Networking is a mash-up of digital video and social networking capabilities. The video aspect offers an interactive and engaging way to tell my story while the social networking capabilities allow the viewers to collaborate, comment and share ideas on what they've seen. Here are a few B2B examples I'm aware of, all of which involve creating a persona to demonstrate a point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title="blocked::http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=" href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DFD5C72D7F6BFCC1"&gt;Cisco's Disconnected Life Webisode Series&lt;/a&gt; - Don and Rhoda Delay's network and communication problems have led them to marriage counseling as they illustrate the 'disconnected life' that I know I couldn't bare. Where's the social networking? Well thanks to YouTube it's in the ability to comment on each of the videos (and keep delivery costs low).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="225" width="405"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/cp/vjVQa1PpcFM4vnaOt_ch0WR_oOBYMJQsMwFf4EX8PfM="&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/cp/vjVQa1PpcFM4vnaOt_ch0WR_oOBYMJQsMwFf4EX8PfM=" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="405" height="225"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title="blocked::http://www.bobkent.net/main.php" href="http://www.bobkent.net/main.php"&gt;Blue Coat's Bob Kent Stories&lt;/a&gt; - Bob Kent represents the bad employee in every company who misuses the Internet at everyone else's expense. The exaggerated stories are ones that anyone in an office environment can relate to. Looking for a way to collaborate?

There's no social networking aspect that I can see so maybe this is just straight video but it's still pretty creative and adding the social component would be easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other examples you think should be added to this list?

At the core of every good team there’s a good plan. This is the person who pulls everything together. They build the Social Media Marketing plan and determine what the objective of the campaign is and therefore what tools should be utilized and how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Manager&lt;/strong&gt; – There are currently two communities that we have an active presence on - &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8132918757"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cisco.com/go/netpro"&gt;NetPro&lt;/a&gt; having someone actively facilitate conversations in these communities would really take things to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Site Management&lt;/strong&gt; – The great thing about engaging your customers in social media is that you can tweak your message depending on the audience. The tough thing about engaging your customers in social media is that your message could end up looking different for every audience. At the core of any marketing strategy lies a common message. We now have a presence on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8132918757"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CiscoSP360"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ciscosp360"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the campaign we may leverage one or more of these channels and having someone to manage the communications and having it centrally executed is critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(including Micro-blogging)&lt;/strong&gt; – Blogging is made up of two basic parts: content creation and content distribution. You could be channeling Shakespeare in your daily journal but if nobody knows about it, it won’t ever matter. Offering assistance to our bloggers to help optimize their posts for the search engines helping with suggestions on key or hot topics or sending out Twitters when new posts are live can make all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; – If a tree falls in your community and you didn’t hear about it; WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU DOING THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT?!? Whether it's with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/alerts"&gt;Google Alerts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nielsenbuzzmetrics.com/"&gt;Nielson BuzzMetrics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.visibletechnologies.com/solutions/trucast.php"&gt;TruCast&lt;/a&gt;, it's important to have an ear on what conversations are happening about our solutions so that we can actively participate in those conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Innovations&lt;/strong&gt; – This involves looking at the technolgoy our web pages use and determining if there are new capabilities available to better communicate or present something on our website. For example behavioral targetting, implementing &lt;a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/ns341/ns525/ns537/sp_asr_announcement.html#~features"&gt;widgets&lt;/a&gt;, or something as simple as adding &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox_(JavaScript)"&gt;Lightbox&lt;/a&gt; treatments can give your entire website a 'web 2.0' feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think?

What does this have to do with marketing? Well, as Brian Morrissey points out in &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i1751753614c1db778a74fc4258b741eb" href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i1751753614c1db778a74fc4258b741eb"&gt;Dell's Hearing Test&lt;/a&gt;, try typing 'Diet Coke' in Google and see what comes up. Two of the top 5 search results are pointing to articles about how Diet Coke is associated to depression. I would hate to be in their PR department right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This claim is based off of a single research study that was done 15 years ago and now because a blogger picked up on it it's resurfaced and is a top search result. It been up there since June 5th and there's no response from Diet Coke. Are they even listening to the conversations happening on the social web? Do they even know that post is out there and spreading further each day? Maybe they &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.eepybird.com/dcm1.html" href="http://www.eepybird.com/dcm1.html"&gt;overdosed on Mentos&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My colleague &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianellefritz" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianellefritz"&gt;Brian Ellefritz&lt;/a&gt; points out that this is great example of why corporations need to be monitoring (and participating) in conversations about their brand. Consumer generated media is not something that can/should be ignored. I think Mark Jarvis, CMO at Dell says it best, "Your home page is Google." From a B2B perspective we can all learn from &lt;a title="blocked::http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2007/10/b2b-blogging-good-example-to-learn-from.html" href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2007/10/b2b-blogging-good-example-to-learn-from.html"&gt;Sun's blogging strategy&lt;/a&gt; in how to jump in and join the conversation and ultimately improve the sentiment of what gets communicated online. You can bet that Sun keeps a close eye on what new conversations about their brand emerge from the social web and if this happened to them I can't imagine they’d go this long without noticing.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/6500690738487301098/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=6500690738487301098' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/6500690738487301098'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/6500690738487301098'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/06/diet-cokes-pr-hell.html' title='Diet Coke&apos;s PR Hell'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SFAzSgLg8WI/AAAAAAAABHI/3aAIpfALT_g/s72-c/dietcoke.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-1228674831449821683</id><published>2008-06-06T09:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-06T09:16:05.243-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='online brand'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='linkedin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='facebook'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='blogging'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='online personality'/><title type='text'>Building an Online Brand in 3-Steps</title><content type='html'>More and more people are starting to realize the power of having a 'personal' online presence and building a personal brand. I have been asked a lot about how I built my brand so I thought I would repeat that conversation here on my blog. However in the context of marketing, I think we also need to spend more time with our executives and helping them to build their online brand which will only further the business relationships that they already have. There are a lot of things you can do to build an online brand but it doesn't need to be a cumbersome activity and ultimately I think there are three main steps that will make the biggest impact:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lasandrabrill"&gt;LinkedIn:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I've been a LinkedIn user since 2000. But it wasn't until 2004 that I saw the the biggest benefit on how to leverage the site. Coming from the very fluid start-up environment and having changed bosses 3 times in one year and co-workers constantly I needed a way to capture recommendations from the people I worked with. I now manage this very closely; if I change positions or if someone I work closely with changes positions I will ask them to write a brief recommendation on my profile while their memory of working with me is still fresh. This helps build my brand with credible third party resources. It's also a great way to build and manage your professional network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way to use LinkedIn to build a brand - although I haven't taken advantage of this - is to participate in the &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers?trk=hb_tab_ayn"&gt;Answers forum&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to provide your input on topics you have an expertise in and your 'answers' are tied back to your profile so you build on the credibility of your expertise overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest brand builder for me has come from my blogging efforts - but this is also the most time consuming. I started blogging just over a year ago in May 2007 and started seeing the benefits after just a few posts. Since I enjoy blogging and the topic I cover I don't consider it 'work' but that is how others view it. So, if you know you can't commit to writing and maintaining a blog don't bother, there are other options for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogging is about joining the conversation by having my own blog that just means at times I'm also starting a conversation but a lot of the time I am still reading and commenting on other blogs. You can still build a brand and expertise in your area by finding the appropriate blogs and joining the conversation by commenting. Usually when you comment on a blog you have the ability to add a cross link, if you have a blog yourself you obviously want to link to that but if you don't, your LinkedIn profile is a good place to link to so that people can learn about who you are and get a sense of your authority/expertise level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=604998464"&gt;Facebook:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I haven't been on Facebook as long - I think it's just under a year now and to be honest I don't use FaceBook to it's full potential either. I do have my profile developed and I do use it to connect with my professional network and the nature of Facebook allows me to interact with my network at a more personal level. However there are many &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups.php?ref=sb"&gt;groups within Facebook&lt;/a&gt; that would allow me to build my brand further if I was an active participant in these communities - I choose not to participate because of lack of time and instead participate in the blogosphere conversations but again if you don't want to commit to blogging this is a less cumbersome way of joining the conversation and ultimately building your online brand.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/1228674831449821683/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=1228674831449821683' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/1228674831449821683'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/1228674831449821683'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/06/building-online-brand-in-3-steps.html' title='Building an Online Brand in 3-Steps'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-3165474027191558017</id><published>2008-05-27T14:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-27T15:27:32.475-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cisco'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><title type='text'>Executing Social Media with Jeanette Gibson</title><content type='html'>Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.chrisheuer.com/"&gt;Chris Heuer&lt;/a&gt;

After getting the right message, the biggest challenges facing marketers are message distribution and authentication. If someone doesn’t see your message, you lose. If they don’t think it’s legitimate or don’t trust its source, you lose. Viral campaigns solve both those problems; accelerating propagation faster than we could ever do ourselves and authenticating the message by having it delivered by a trusted source. It’s marketing Nirvana. Forget &lt;a href="http://www.christmas-tree.com/stories/nightbeforechristmas.html"&gt;visions of sugar plums&lt;/a&gt; dancing through my head - when I sleep I see social networks acting as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplier"&gt;Force Multipliers&lt;/a&gt;; delivering my carefully packaged message to receptive and qualified customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier said than done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey if it were that easy everybody would be doing it. There are many perils on the long winding road up the peak to Marketer’s Paradise not the least of which is crafting the perfect message. But let’s say you get through that, how on earth do you build a messaging vehicle that has the potential to go viral? And even after you do that what’s really the benefit of doing so? Is there any way to measure the effectiveness of viral effectiveness on buying decisions? I mean, even if the message is right and its delivered by a trusted source in a reasonable time frame is it more effective than a billboard in Times Square?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re still very early in our understanding of how effective social media and other 2.0ish technologies will be in helping plain Jane campaigns achieve “viral” status, but the returns so far are encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that’s much harder to measure however is the effect of networks on individual behavioral (buying) decisions. We know that message reception and retention will be higher when coming from “the network”, but how influential is “the network” on decisions overall?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral messaging or networked buying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;New &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/25/AR2008052501779.html?nav=rss_nation"&gt;research out of Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; indicates that social networks may have more to do with individual buying decisions than we thought. When coupled with Social Media Marketing campaigns this can be much more powerful than just a more effective message delivery campaign. Instead of just permeating an effective message, a “tuned” network could theoretically process a message and if followed up with positive product purchase experiences, directly influence the purchasing decisions of others in the network. This makes the “message spreading” potential of viral marketing seem downright anemic. Traditional viral marketing still relies on the effectiveness of my message to be effective. But if this research holds true for Social Media networks, then there might be a more compelling and cost effective way to harness “the network” in marketing campaigns that transcend traditional message delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When thinking strategically, its easy to get caught up in thinking that marketing is about messaging and message delivery. But its not. Its about selling product. Too often I think we’re content with getting qualified buyers to the table. What if we could more directly influence actual buying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain markets are already operating in this paradigm and as I consider new campaigns in the future I will certainly be looking closer at “network influence on buying behavior” campaigns rather than the traditional “network influence on message delivery” projects that have worked for us in the past.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/5954110467533867886/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=5954110467533867886' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/5954110467533867886'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/5954110467533867886'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/05/coffees-for-closers.html' title='Coffee&apos;s for Closers'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SDuxTlePIxI/AAAAAAAABGI/LX3YxbpIqPM/s72-c/db_glenros%5B1%5D.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-1256057407747115349</id><published>2008-05-15T23:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-15T23:47:30.043-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cisco'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='online games'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media release'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='facebook'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='del.icio.us'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='twitter'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='digg'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='youtube'/><title type='text'>Cisco Marketing Has Got Game</title><content type='html'>&lt;object style="FLOAT: right" height="250" width="300"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/AOzJHJ-Edkk&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/AOzJHJ-Edkk&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="300" height="250" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;Some call it &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.socialmediamagazine.com/social-blog/social-media-marketing/2008/05/edge-quest-tournament-of-aces-social-marketing-excellence/" href="http://www.socialmediamagazine.com/social-blog/social-media-marketing/2008/05/edge-quest-tournament-of-aces-social-marketing-excellence/"&gt;social media excellence&lt;/a&gt; some just say we've &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.productbeautiful.com/2008/05/08/cisco-marketing-has-gone-crazylike-a-fox/" href="http://www.productbeautiful.com/2008/05/08/cisco-marketing-has-gone-crazylike-a-fox/"&gt;gone crazy&lt;/a&gt;...whatever you call it, it seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extension to the social media efforts that we're leveraged for &lt;a title="blocked::http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/03/leveraging-social-media-and-web-20-in.html" href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/03/leveraging-social-media-and-web-20-in.html"&gt;Cisco's ASR launch&lt;/a&gt;, Cisco &lt;a title="blocked::http://blogs.cisco.com/sp/2008/05/cisco_edge_quest_tournament_of.html" href="http://blogs.cisco.com/sp/2008/05/cisco_edge_quest_tournament_of.html"&gt;announced a tournament&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.cisco.com/go/edgequest" href="http://www.cisco.com/go/edgequest"&gt;EDGE QUEST game&lt;/a&gt; where they are offering $10,000 cash plus a Cisco ASR 1002 router to the sole winner. Not a bad deal for playing a game but the competition is stiff with a top score currently at 204,540.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't exactly &lt;a title="blocked::http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/03/leveraging-social-media-and-web-20-in.html" href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/03/leveraging-social-media-and-web-20-in.html"&gt;kept it a secret&lt;/a&gt; that I'm one of the marketers behind this campaign so of course I think it's cool but here are a few specific reasons why I think it’s working for us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're reaching our target audience in a new, fun, and engaging way. Last year &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=" href="http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=1521"&gt;online gaming attracted 28 percent of the total worldwide online population&lt;/a&gt; -- almost 217 million people -- and according to CIMS, &lt;a title="blocked::http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/online-gaming-web-20s-killer-app.html" href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/online-gaming-web-20s-killer-app.html"&gt;24% of those were IT professionals&lt;/a&gt;! Us marketers are always trying to fish in a big pond but it helps when they’re all swimming in the same place. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low cost, high ROI. This program was an extension of an existing program. The EDGE QUEST game was created at launch so the cost of the tournament includes just the "carrot" of $10K plus the router. We also invested a small amount in changing the game a bit for the "money round" of the tournament but no budget went into promotion we focused solely on social media outlets. In return we've had an influx in PR and Blog pick-ups and a substatial increase in traffic to the game and product page. All of this activity of course is being measured and considered as part of the ROI of the campaign. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was just a blast to work on. Hey there's nothing wrong with that - it's fun for the people engaging with Cisco in a new way and it was fun to be part of the marketing team to develop and creatively promote the game and tournament leveraging social media tactics which included a &lt;a title="blocked::http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/prod_050508c.html" href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/prod_050508c.html"&gt;social media release&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8132918757"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="blocked::http://twitter.com/ciscosp360" href="http://twitter.com/ciscosp360"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.youtube.com/CiscoSP360" href="http://www.youtube.com/CiscoSP360"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="blocked::http://del.icio.us/CiscoSP360" href="http://del.icio.us/CiscoSP360%20"&gt;Del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="blocked::http://digg.com/users/CiscoSP360" href="http://digg.com/users/CiscoSP360"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.flickr.com/photos/26171422@N04/" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26171422@N04/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular campaign won't work for everyone but creating a social marketing campaign can get your customers engaged and extend your message far beyond traditional marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/1256057407747115349/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=1256057407747115349' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/1256057407747115349'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/1256057407747115349'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/05/cisco-maketings-got-game.html' title='Cisco Marketing Has Got Game'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-7360440778210688736</id><published>2008-05-11T23:06:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-12T11:05:46.463-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing'/><title type='text'>Overcoming Social Media Objections</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.”&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Aiken" target="_blank"&gt;Howard Aiken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Aiken discovered, knowing which direction to go doesn’t mean much if you can’t get your team to follow. Thankfully, unlike Dr. Aiken we don’t have to convince people to buy in on an idea as crazy as building a computer at a time when phones were considered state of the art. But knowing that doesn’t make our job any easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All marketing campaigns come down to getting time, money, or resources and to be done properly, your Social Media Marketing campaign will likely need a little of all three. For many of us, this means approval from one or more decision makers on a marketing campaign that may be fundamentally different from anything they’ve done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people considering your idea are going to have a running list going of positives and negatives. If they’re like most humans, this list won’t be entirely rational and will likely end up coming down to one major factor either way. Whether choosing new cars, new houses, or even new presidential candidates – people can usually narrow down their decision making criteria to one or two factors, positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to know which factors will be most critical to the people in your audience but if they’re anything like the folks I’ve been working with, here’s a few that come up almost every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The devil we know IS NOT SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING”. This is where many good ideas have gone to die. While it’s true that building a social media project likely won’t be as predictable as a more traditional campaign, there is a healthy amount of data out there already. Besides this blog, success stories and ROI can be found on sites such as &lt;a href="http://www.conversationsmatter.org/"&gt;Conversations Matter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.webguild.org/"&gt;WebGuild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/" target="_blank"&gt;Groundswell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thesocialorganization.com/social-media-examples.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Social Organization&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://marshallk.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Marshall Kirkpatrick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We’re already doing social media marketing. We have a website, and it has a “talk to a sales rep” button – what else is there?” There is a common misconception amongst the uninitiated that if a company is online, it’s “connected”. As much hype as Web 2.0 receives, there are still many people who don’t get what it is, what it’s for, and more importantly where it might help. The only way to correct this is with education. In addition to collaborating on Web 2.0 projects enterprise-wide, I drive adoption through educational blog posts, workshops and webinars. I’ve found that most people, especially in marketing, have a remarkable capacity to learn about the bleeding edge but if they’re making a go/no go decision on your new project, it might be too late. The way to beat this one is early and often. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“OK, even if we do it with social media, how would we know if it worked?” Unlike “direct response” or “click through” marketing, social media campaigns aren’t as easily measured. Oftentimes we’re counting things like “engagement” and “connections” that don’t have a correlation to existing marketing metrics programs. At first blush, this seems like a minor point that will get fixed in time. But if your team is compensated on traditional marketing MBO’s, they might not be as motivated to kick off a social media endeavor. Marketing runs on metrics, but somehow TV and print ads get approved every year – stick to your guns, metrics are important but there are other factors to consider. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These certainly are not the only objections that you’ll run up against in trying to get your social media campaign off the ground, but they seem to be pretty common. Feel free to share objections you’ve come up against and any ideas on how to work through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/7360440778210688736/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=7360440778210688736' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/7360440778210688736'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/7360440778210688736'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/05/overcoming-social-media-objections.html' title='Overcoming Social Media Objections'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-1494678042068516135</id><published>2008-04-30T22:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-30T22:47:19.414-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='conversational marketing'/><title type='text'>Conversations Matter - Field Guide to Social Media Marketing</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SBlYxPV4rgI/AAAAAAAAAaA/llMlyfjMBBM/s1600-h/CMlogo.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195281248103738882" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SBlYxPV4rgI/AAAAAAAAAaA/llMlyfjMBBM/s200/CMlogo.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At some point in the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;lifecycle&lt;/span&gt; of every new idea, somebody actually has to try it out. Soon after that, so the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;cliché&lt;/span&gt; goes, some brave, soot-covered soul emerges from a smoke filled lab with a beaker in one hand and charred lab results in the other.

In the world of Social Media Marketing, there are a lot of these brave souls, and a few of us have decided to get together and report back on our findings in this blog, &lt;a href="http://www.conversationsmatter.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversations Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title="blocked::http://www.britopian.com/" href="http://www.britopian.com/"&gt;Michael &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;Brito&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="blocked::http://armchairmarketing.blogspot.com/" href="http://armchairmarketing.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kelly Feller&lt;/a&gt; from Intel, &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.newcommbiz.com/" href="http://www.newcommbiz.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;Tac&lt;/span&gt; Anderson&lt;/a&gt; from HP, &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.tomdiederich.com/" href="http://www.tomdiederich.com/"&gt;Tom &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;Diederich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Cadence Design Systems, and &lt;a title="blocked::http://dogballs.typepad.com/" href="http://dogballs.typepad.com/"&gt;Marc Levin&lt;/a&gt; who is an independent marketing consultant - formerly at Yahoo!, and I will be participating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been said that when you get to a certain point in any discipline, the only way to learn more is by trying to share your experience with someone else. It’s our hope that by sharing our experiences in this blog, we’ll benefit by leveraging the same principles that make Social Media Marketing so effective in letting us connect with our customers.

But it was Friday after a long week so I apologize for the delay in getting this post up but here are my key takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keynote: Dan Lyons, aka Fake Steve Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guy is hilarious and he authors &lt;a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/"&gt;an entertaining blog&lt;/a&gt; from the perspective of Steve Jobs (on crack). He talked about how and why he started the blog and why he thinks it works. In the end it boils down to boredom, fear, an idea, and an engaged audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boredom because it started as a prank that happened to take on a life of its own. Fear because as a traditional Forbes tech writer he saw print publications coming to an end due to the emergence of blogs. An idea - "what would Steve Jobs write if he really did go nuts?" And an engaged audience that included 90K monthly readers after just 6 months and 25-50 emails a day with suggestions on what to write next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games 2.0: Why the Future of Games Looks More Like Zombies and Scrabulous and Less Like Halo 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This session ended up being a little different than what I expected but what was interesting is that while social networking sites are trying to deploy game dynamics in their communities as discussed in the &lt;a href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/04/children-of-flickr-making-massively.html"&gt;'Children of Flickr'&lt;/a&gt; session, game sites are trying to embed social relationships and social context into games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Audience is the Medium: Video 2.0 &amp;amp; Online Communities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I was a little late to this session but joined in on the debate of Live vs. On-Demand video. Live events have a higher interaction and allow viewers to be part of the conversation. BUT...the web is not equip to handle live video distribution and advertisers look at the big numbers as oppose to engagement. Ultimately there's a place for both and the decision needs to be made based on the objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Online Communities: Lessons from the Best of the Consumer &amp;amp; Business Community Managers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This session included community managers from SFDC, Dell, Yahoo!, Kiva and Flickr. Here are a few things worth passing on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SFDC put the responsibility of their community into the hands of their product managers by making it part of their job to create, encourage and maintain conversations for their product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kiva lucked out and avoided formal marketing all together. They grow 100% organically through word of mouth - but a big part of this was knowing and connecting with the right people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flickr suggests being 'elastic' and don't just try to make your audience do what you want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When building a community create a feedback mechanism. Don't just listen - engage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When hiring a community manager look for someone with relationship building and communication skills - PR background a plus. Also someone who authors their own blog or possibly someone in your community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best-kept Secrets to Search Engine Optimization Success: the Art and the Science&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This was a session on Wednesday that I attended but didn't have good notes for.

This session was moderated by Justin Hall from GameLayers with three panelists: Rajat Paharia from Bunchball, Christopher Chapman from Areae and Gabe Zichermann from rmbr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of this session - &lt;strong&gt;Everything can be a Game&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This session focused on game dynamics and how game psychology can drive engagement, interaction and loyalty on your website, traditionally a non-gaming environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe was clearly passionate about the gaming concept and explains it as "the only force that exists without the threat of violence that makes people do irrational things."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a few key takeaways I walked away with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The definition of a game is changing and what people really want is to do something they like, something they consider fun, and/or something that makes them feel like they accomplished something. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are three basic things to make something fun: Challenges, Leaderboards and Points - when added to any experience it changes peoples behavior.&lt;br /&gt;Advice is to think about how to make an experience fun from day 1. If you’re not in a situation to do that you can still go through the experience and layer in gaming mechanics to et more engagement and interaction from your existing community. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Game mechanics involve rewarding people along their journey. You can have different metrics for success to make them feel like they are 'winning'; for example slice and dice the data - different activities can have different leaderboards and that data can be grouped by network or time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaming Essentials from Gabe: It needs to be overly simple (no instructions required); you need to be able to play with one hand; you need to be able to start/stop playing at any time; and it needs to be infinitely playable. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting stats - woman who are 35+ are not thought to be traditional 'gamers' however they are the demographic that drives a big portion of the gaming industry including Yahoo Games. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gabe dropped an interesting bomb about how women don’t respond as well to 3D environments and the fact that they are not well liked by a lot of people because they are confrontational. He recommends sticking to a 2D environment like the world we live itn. He says 2D environments are easier to navigate and ultimately more flexible. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/2893700136901710403/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=2893700136901710403' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2893700136901710403'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2893700136901710403'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/04/children-of-flickr-making-massively.html' title='Children of Flickr: Making the Massively Multiplayer Social Web'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s72-c/web2.bmp' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-2525740689146489018</id><published>2008-04-23T15:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-23T17:57:14.571-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networking'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web2expo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='community'/><title type='text'>Bringing Web 2.0 to your Enterprise</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s1600-h/web2.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192566317671558610" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s200/web2.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This was a vendor driven session presented by David Carter, CTO of &lt;a title="blocked::http://www.awarenessnetworks.com/home/" href="http://www.awarenessnetworks.com/home/"&gt;Awareness&lt;/a&gt;. Awareness helps companies build web 2.0 communities for internal or external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David started off the session stating that the challenges we faced in 1988 haven't changed within an enterprise. I thought this was interesting because as much as things changed they also stay the same. We are still trying to improve collaboration, trying to connect the right people and trying to make information easier to find (that's always fun). And these challenges only get harder as the organization grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David continued to talk about why this is a problem internally and that "the" collaboration tool within the enterprise is still EMAIL. Why is that a problem? Well, when people leave the organization so does all of that intellectual property. Common sense for most of my readers but it's still a problem most enterprises haven't solved. There's still a need to figure out what content to pull out of email and into collaboration tools like blogs, wiki's and discussion forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of McDonald’s, Awareness was looking for creative ways to engage people and get them to share ideas. They did this during an event registration process which simultaneously built a person's online profile and with an optional question at the end. Hundreds of people were contributing content that was then made public and shared with the rest of the organization. By doing this they removed the barrier of entry and made it very easy and convenient for people to contribute. This was one of my favorite examples and I think it can be leveraged in multiple ways to kick start a new community.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/2525740689146489018/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=2525740689146489018' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2525740689146489018'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2525740689146489018'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/04/bringing-web-20-to-your-enterprise.html' title='Bringing Web 2.0 to your Enterprise'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s72-c/web2.bmp' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-468505228802364216</id><published>2008-04-23T15:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-24T21:40:04.724-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web2expo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='community'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing 2.0'/><title type='text'>Community Building: Good, Bad, and Ugly</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s1600-h/web2.bmp"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192566317671558610" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s200/web2.bmp" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I am at the &lt;a title="blocked::http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/content/home" href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/content/home"&gt;Web 2.0 Expo&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco today surrounded by hundreds of other web geeks like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off the day at the "&lt;a title="blocked::http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/389" href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/389"&gt;Community Building: Good, Bad, and Ugly&lt;/a&gt;" session which was moderated by Jeremiah Owyang from Forrester Research and included three panelists: Dawn Foster from Jive Software, Bob Duffy from Intel, and Kellie Parker from PC World and Macworld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a summary of the panel discussion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the opportunity when it comes to building a community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communities provide the platform for your evangelists to shine and talk about your products. This builds brand loyalty and allows you to engage with this audience and also learn and get feedback from them on your company/products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you build or join a community?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Both. When people come to your side you want to give them the ability to interact and engage when they are there but you also want to interact in communities where you are the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills are needed to manage a community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kellie explains her role as a community manager as the host of a party. Her role is to add value by introducing people and encourage conversation with the different people who show up.&lt;br /&gt;Need to be diplomatic and let negative people know that they were heard. You need to have a customer mindset and remember that you are there to serve them - not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to balance being an advocate of your company to your community while being the community advocate back to your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the challenges around community building?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel's biggest challenge was the organization and the resources available. To get around this Bob spent a lot of time getting data and building a strong strategy - then spent a few weeks evangelizing the plan to get buy-in and support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn's challenge was getting people to come after it was built. In this situation they reached out to their influencers and evangelist and they helped spread the word. By brining them in early and giving them beta access to the site they embraced the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with trolls or negative people, don't be quick on the trigger. Be patient and allow the community to jump in . If your evangelists jump in it is seen as much more credible.&lt;br /&gt;Getting people to engage can be a challenge. In this case Kellie recommends starting with something simple that everyone has an answer to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the ROI, how do you measure success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The common answer - it's based on the objective. Intel looked at organic traffic and how much their blogs and forums are driving that traffic as well as the increased number of logins and registration. Their goal is to build a stronger, loyal customer base. Jive is looking at participation and the number of messages posted. They don't try to tie it to sales and look at the community as an awareness tool. PC World/Macworld looks at both page views and interaction with number of messages posted.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/468505228802364216/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=468505228802364216' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/468505228802364216'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/468505228802364216'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/04/community-building-good-bad-and-ugly.html' title='Community Building: Good, Bad, and Ugly'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_3KSeU8Rwt7o/SA-zjfV4rdI/AAAAAAAAAZo/IFCshRDpnIE/s72-c/web2.bmp' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-2095626654353257877</id><published>2008-04-18T11:14:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-18T19:11:09.821-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='webapps'/><title type='text'>Rising Tide of Web Apps Should Lift Marketing 2.0 Boat</title><content type='html'>One thing worth keeping an eye on from a Marketing 2.0 perspective is new technology that could improve or augment the technology we use.  There’s no disputing that although Marketing 2.0 represents a &lt;a href="http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2007/05/marketing-20-revolution.html"&gt;significant change of philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and core marketing strategy, new technology enabling faster and more efficient communication and collaboration is at least an enabler, if not the inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s because of this that I’m always excited to hear about further adoption of web-based anything; whether it be a bigger piece of the pie for web-based advertising; more funding to support Web 2.0 apps; or further adoption of web-based office apps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.redherring.com/Home/24122"&gt;This week’s news&lt;/a&gt; that Google’s web-based applications suite will integrate with Salesforce.com’s app is nothing but good news for those of us who live and die with web-tech.  Is this going to change the world over night?  Of course not.  But it will give a certain class of customers a much desired alternative to the Microsoft hegemony in the office apps market.  More exciting than that though, it will drive adoption of the web-based office, more reliable web connections, and indirectly, adoption for the technology that makes Marketing 2.0 possible.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/2095626654353257877/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=2095626654353257877' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2095626654353257877'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/2095626654353257877'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/04/rising-tide-of-web-apps-should-lift.html' title='Rising Tide of Web Apps Should Lift Marketing 2.0 Boat'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8448954755651247046.post-6506805545007315697</id><published>2008-04-08T22:24:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-08T22:27:51.156-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='personas'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='online personality'/><title type='text'>Pulse on the Blogosphere</title><content type='html'>Here are a few recent posts that I think are worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matt Dickerson tells you everything you need to know about personas in his post "&lt;a href="http://technomarketer.typepad.com/technomarketer/2008/04/developing-pers.html"&gt;Developing Personas for Marketing Strategy&lt;/a&gt;" - Cisco's Martin Hardee's gives a inside look at Cisco's approach to personas in this post "&lt;a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-t.cgi/1577"&gt;How we Design for Cisco.com&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Charlene Li has an awesome post that every company should read about how to transition your traditional marketing group to a social media marketing group in her post "&lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/146365/27239896"&gt;Turning radicals into revolutionaries: the key to kick-starting your social strategy&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tamar Weinberg has a collection of upcoming web 2.0 events on a single post - very useful - "&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/04/08/mashables-upcoming-conferences-and-events/"&gt;Mashable’s Guide to Upcoming Web 2.0 Conferences and Events&lt;/a&gt;" (BTW - I plan on attending the &lt;a href="http://www.web2expo.com/"&gt;Web 2.0 Expo&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco April 22-25) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greg Verdino has a nice post "&lt;a href="http://gregverdino.typepad.com/greg_verdinos_blog/2008/03/infographics-or.html"&gt;An Orgy of Infographics&lt;/a&gt;" which great visuals and interesting stats worth checking out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jeremiah Owyang tells outlines his &lt;a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/04/05/my-essential-twitter-tools/"&gt;'Essential Twitter Tools&lt;/a&gt;" - a must read for any Twitterer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Visit the blog that this content comes from http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/feeds/6506805545007315697/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8448954755651247046&amp;postID=6506805545007315697' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/6506805545007315697'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8448954755651247046/posts/default/6506805545007315697'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lasandrabrill.blogspot.com/2008/04/pulse-on-blogosphere.html' title='Pulse on the Blogosphere'/><author><name>LaSandra Brill</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09736201493512920902</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
