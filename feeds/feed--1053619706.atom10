<p>Police firing on Delft residents earlier this year</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Earlier today at around 17h15, police officer De Vos of the Delft police station along with 4 other officers entered Symphony Way and began verbally swearing at and abusing residents. The majority of residents were in a workshop led by an American from a children&#8217;s NGO. When Jane Roberts came outside the office where the workshop was taking place, De Vos immediately began threatening Auntie Jane with arrest. He told her quote: &quot;I am going to moor you&quot; and &quot;I will lock you up&quot; and a number of other words inappropriate to publish. He was clearly picking on Aunty Jane because of past instances in which she has opposed his abuse of the community.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two Americans were also present. The one is the Executive Director of a children&#8217;s NGO and the other an American journalist. When they both began documenting the abuse on their cameras and phone, police immediately began threatening to confiscate their cameras and arrest them. A woman police officer then came and slapped the one American and threw his camera to the ground. Police left at around 18h00 once other police officers arrived at the scene.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, at 20h00, De Vos came back with his crew and arrested resident Roger Wicks who had nothing to do with the previous incident. He has now been charged with swearing at police and malicious damage to property.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tomorrow, residents, along with the two Americans, will attempt to lay a charge at the Delft police station against De Vos and the other four police officers on duty.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This is not the first incident of police abuse. There have been over 10 incidents since February 2008 including on <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/10/30/good-news-bad-news-a-carrot-and-some-shotguns/" target="_blank">30 October 2008</a> and <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/10/04/police-illegally-destroy-homes-on-symphony-way/" target="_blank">4 October 2008</a> and <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/06/29/press-alert-police-intimidate-and-assault-delft-symphony-pavement-dwellers-american-journalist-gets-pepper-sprayed-for-taking-photos/" target="_blank">29 June, 2008</a> and <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/02/25/police-set-up-2-illegal-roadblocks-in-delft-to-prevent-relief-from-reaching-the-people/" target="_blank">25 February 2008</a> .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was also the many instances of brutality during the 19<sup>th</sup> of February evictions. Documentation includes: (a) Star article: <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/02/19/delft-refuse-resist-eviction/" target="_blank">Delft refuse, resist eviction</a> , (b) <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/02/19/police-brutality-in-delft-caught-on-tape/" target="_blank">video by a bystander</a> , (c) <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/02/19/video-of-delft-shootings-on-etv/" target="_blank">video by eTV</a> and (d) <a href="http://antieviction.org.za/2008/02/22/pictures-of-delft-evictions-and-police-brutality/" target="_blank">photos</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Duane<p>Recently, in his blog Constitutionally Speaking, Pierre de Vos, the eminent Constitutional law expert, mentioned that the ANC has proposed that a “revamped Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) deal initially with all criminal complaints against the police”. As de Vos points out, the move is disturbing for a number of reasons. It is unconstitutional because it in essence makes the police exempt from The Rule of Law, a founding value of the new democratic dispensation, where everyone is held accountable to the justice system regardless of their social position. It infringes on the right of the National Prosecuting Authorities’ right to execute their Constitutionally protected mandate to institute criminal proceedings without “fear, favour or prejudice”. Most significantly, it sends a message to the police that they would not be held accountable for the increasingly heavy handed and sometimes blatantly illegal manner in which they execute their duties, especially in situations of face-to-face, hands-on engagement with suspects.</p>
<p><span id="more-303"></span></p>
<p>The proposal comes as no surprise though since in many ways it is merely a cherry on an already iced cake. For one, it should be noted that de Vos perhaps over-estimates the ICD’s powers. I am not a law expert or anything, but it is common knowledge that the ICD is a body that investigates complaints made against the police, the findings of which are forwarded to the relevant authorities in the form of their recommendations. Those in authority, in other words other higher ranking police officers, then consult the recommendations and decide on a course of action. It is well known that police services are galvanised by a powerful sense of loyalty towards their fellow brothers and sisters, and, as such, when given the opportunity, they will ardently defend the public reputation of those in their ranks accused of some injustice. So, in that case, what do you think happens in the majority of cases where the ICD recommends that the police were at fault and that a serious course of action be taken—the officer in question is relieved of his gun and badge and sent to the cells?</p>
<p>Secondly, as we may recall, some months ago the Justice Minister (if I’m not mistaken), tacitly granted the police force 007 status when she pronounced that they go ahead and “shoot to kill” those miscreants who failed to respond to conventional forms of communication. Ironically, her wish came true some weeks after when Gauteng police officers smoked a family of five as they made their escape from a team of masked robbers ransacking their home. Clearly, the new proposal serves to simply ratify the state’s increasing tendency to shirk and even flout its responsibility to uphold the rule of law and its accountability to the people.</p>
<p>Now, it is easy to take a liberal, romantic humanist line on this and throw a tearful, mortifying tantrum about the injustice of it all, and blame it on the arrogance of the ANC government. It isn’t so easy however when your chubby-cheeked, Harry-Potter loving, straight-A’s, UCT-bound, fifteen year old daughter has been jackrolled by a team of HIV infested hardened criminals known to you, and the police tell you that nothing can be done because of some legal technicality. It isn’t so easy when your life-partner’s face is blown away in a hijacking and the police are unable to arrest the suspects out of fear of exchanging fire with them in public. We have to acknowledge that the South African Police Services (SAPS) work under extraordinary circumstances and deal with a special brand of deviant, which means they require powers that transcend those accorded to ordinary citizens. In this way, we should be tolerant and accepting of the accident’s and minor mishaps that occur along the way. A family here, a brutal beating of an innocent civilian there, these are but a few of the concessions we South Africans have to make to maintain the lustre of the Rainbow Nation.</p>
<p>Thus, as patriotic citizens of this beautiful nation we should do everything in our power to support them in their efforts. Here is how I propose we go about it. We start a website tentatively entitled SAPSuncut.co.za which we could use as a platform to express our appreciation for the hard work the police do on our behalf. SAPSuncut would be like a local version of YouTube dedicated exclusively to the valiant efforts of the police service. Here members of the public will be able to upload their privately recorded video clips of police officers executing their duties, or rather, dramatic footage of crime busting in action. On many occasions I’ve passed by a scene where SAPS officers were engaged in hand to hand skirmishes with resistant suspects, often pausing to marvel at how well trained the police were in martial arts and other hand to hand combat styles as they performed elaborate headlocks, submission holds or delivered crippling blows with feet, head and hands. If there was an appropriate forum for uploading such graphic and riveting video footage I would surely have whipped out my cellphone and used it to record the event, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>We could have a running pole on the homepage of the “Ultimate Bad Asses” showcasing video footage of some of SA’s most frequently captured, and most ruthless coppers, as voted by you the public, massacring fiends of all shapes and sizes. In cases where multiple video’s of the same incident is uploaded we could arrange them so one could view different angles of the unfolding action: a headlock here, a tooth-dislodging punch to one side, a bone-crushing baton over the face on the other.</p>
<p>Lets work on this people, especially now that its summer. Let’s give the cops a big thank you from us. Can you imagine how flattering it would be for them to have a crowd of onlookers pointing their camera phones, recording them in the course of their duties? How happy wouldn’t they be seeing themselves on screen brutalising deviant punks, knowing full well that millions of people across the world planning their trips to SA for the 2010 Soccer World Cup would get some peace of mind that the SA police service is capable of ensuring their safety? I cannot think of a better way of saluting the police. Who’s with me on this?</p>

<p>The way to the village of  Mutwanga is a bone-crushing journey, plunging down from a high ridge along a  dirt track.</p>
<p>In places, we had to stop the vehicle altogether to rebuild bridges of  branches and planks across drainage ditches, where rainwater had tried to  reclaim the track for the jungle again. At the bottom<br />
of  the valley, the vegetation is thick and giant tropical palms are laced together  by an impenetrable thicket of creepers - a jungle out of a dream, flanking the  River Nile.Even up here, half a continent away from its mouth near Cairo, it is a mighty  river. As wide as the Thames as it comes into London, but far more intense -  deep, muddy, mysterious, cutting its way through the thick tropical forest.</p>
<p><span id="more-302"></span></p>
<p><strong>Ugly scars</strong></p>
<p>After travelling up the other side into the foothills of the Ruwenzori range,  including Africa&#8217;s third-highest peak, shrouded in mist above us, the air is  thinner and breathing becomes harder as we walk through the village.</p>
<p>This mountain fastness was remote from the front line, even when 11 nations  fought in what is now called Africa&#8217;s Great War in the late 1990s, when three,  four or five million people died. Nobody knows how many for sure.</p>
<p>But  even if there was no physical fighting here, the war came all the same.A schoolgirl shows the ugly scar of a bullet hole in her leg after being held  for four years by militiamen, who had seized her from her home in the night.</p>
<p>And this year the militia have come back.</p>
<p>One day recently, as two brothers aged eight and 12 were tending a vegetable  patch in front of their house, gunmen emerged into the village and took them  away as recruits. Their mother told me 20 other boys were taken that morning  too.</p>
<p>Although all sides use child soldiers, the kidnappers were probably the  Mai-Mai, who portray themselves as a defence force, protecting the community at  a time of unrest against the rebel army led by Laurent Nkunda.</p>
<p>They believe their warriors are invested with magical powers that can turn  stones into bombs, and protect them from bullets.</p>
<p>Their roots lie among the Mai-Mai rebels who began a campaign to force an end  to Belgian rule in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>While filming an interview with an ex-Mai-Mai commander, I heard one of those  things you hear very occasionally that you cannot quite believe you heard  properly.</p>
<p>&quot;C&#8217;etait mon pere qui a mange le premier belge,&quot; he said in a matter-of-fact  way. &quot;My father was the first to eat a Belgian.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brutality</strong></p>
<p>Belgian control of the Congo began with the  slavery and murder sanctioned by King Leopold in the late 19th Century, as he  turned this vast piece of Africa into his personal possession.</p>
<p>One authoritative estimate has put the number killed by Leopold at 10  million.</p>
<p>His troops needed to account for every bullet they were given, so they would  cut the hands off those they killed as proof.</p>
<p>And if they lost a bullet or used one to kill an animal to eat, then they  would have to cut the hand off a living person - just one of the European  practices that so brutalised Africa that by the late 1950s eating Belgians felt  justifiable.</p>
<p>And now the Mai Mai are back, recruiting and indoctrinating boys and girls  for another jungle war.</p>
<p>My guide was Henri Bura Ladyi, a tireless campaigner for peace, who spends  his time trying to keep the community together, mobilising the churches to  collect food and blankets and finding shelter for the tens of thousands of  displaced people flooding in already as the fighting worsens further south.</p>
<p>The displaced are settling into shop fronts, bus stations, the garden of the  town hall, anywhere they can find, and Henri is trying to persuade local  businesses not to pay the Mai Mai to protect the area again.</p>
<p>It is a measure of this dysfunctional society that it should turn to the Mai  Mai for defence at a time of crisis.</p>
<p>Government forces are weak, corrupt, poorly-paid and led by regional warlords  who do not necessarily owe loyalty to President Joseph Kabila, 1,200 miles  (2,000km) away in the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>Many have not been paid for months.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Indoctrinated&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>In the school in the village of Mutwanga, I listen in to a class where an  enthusiastic teacher has a catchphrase in English.</p>
<p>&quot;Time is money&quot; he says, &quot;time is money,&quot; bustling along to encourage the  boys as they write in this unfamiliar language.</p>
<p>Twenty boys are missing, though, being indoctrinated in a different way in  the jungle.</p>
<p>Part of the school day is taken up by the children going out to collect rocks  to help for a new building at the school. Remote from central government, they  need to help themselves.</p>
<p>That is how conflict causes poverty.</p>
<p>In a place full of valuable mineral wealth and surrounded by a landscape that  should be a tourist paradise, schoolchildren collect rocks when they should be  in lessons.</p>

<p>Refer to Police Shielded from the law by Pierre De Vos&#8230;</p>
<p>It seems as if steps are being taken to grant further priviledges to the police, with statements made that police do not have to be subject to the same treatment as ordinary criminals.</p>
<p>The Cape Times reports this morning that the ANC wants to protect members of the South African Police Service from being dragged into court “to clear their names” when a criminal complaint is filed against them. According to the report:</p>
<p><span id="more-301"></span></p>
<p><em>[T]he party has proposed that a revamped Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) deal initially with all criminal complaints against police.</em></p>
<p><em>ANC members, who discussed the issue during a meeting of the conference’s peace and stability commission yesterday, argued that police should not be subjected to the same treatment as “ordinary criminals” when faced with being charged with a crime.</em></p>
<p><em>This amounted to the “criminalisation” of officers simply because they were accused of an offence, one delegate said. A delegate who attended the discussion said the proposal meant, for example, that if an officer “shoots someone who poses a danger to the public, (the ICD) will … determine whether to refer the case for further investigation and prosecution”.</em></p>
<p>This conduct as indicated feeds the idea that they should be exempt from ordinary laws.  The ICD has the potential to shield them from the very laws that protect us. Coupled with lack of proper training in dealing with situations, and a feeling of little importance in society may fuel their need for violence.</p>
<p>Are we reverting back to the days of Apartheid? Should we answer a violent society by allowing more violence to be perpertrated in the hope of salvaging the situation. This &quot;solution&quot; instead of training police or using smarter tactics. This “shoot to kill” attitude in response to threats such as the Xenophobia issue is a drawback to same attitude adopted in response to Apartheid insurgency.</p>
<p>The past year has shown the capabilities of the police. At times they deserve commendment for their efforts. But should they be granted desperate solutions granting excessive power and short term relief in desperate situations. Laws are there to protect society, and preventing certain individuals from being subject to these laws can cause severe problems.</p>

<p>Apartheid mentality</p>
<p><img src="http://54beats.com/images/necklace.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A situation which grants them potential absolute power, will naturally corrupt them absolutely. The easy freedom to use excessive force to solve a problem will naturally encourage the repetition of this sort of action. The idea that they are exempt and seemingly above the law, will encourage them to act in this way. Instead of serving and protecting they will merely  intimidate and bully. It seems as if history is repeating itself with potentially dire consequences.</p>

<p>Perhaps no African country other than Eritrea has in recent years harvested more unpleasant recognition, notoriety if you like, for being number one in doing what is morally, socially and politically unacceptable.</p>
<p><span id="more-300"></span></p>
<p>Eritrea has long been portrayed by global rights bodies as a state incapable or unwilling to respect basic human and democratic rights and support freedom of expression and conscience.</p>
<p>Economics experts have also sharply criticized the government for its inability to feed its citizens – two thirds of them said to be going to bed with little or no food in their bellies.</p>
<p>Adding to its numerous social and economic setbacks, a Pan African study has put Eritrea along with Guinea Bissau in West Africa on top of a list of 52 African countries (excluding fractured Somalia and Morocco occupied W.Sahara) as the worst places for children to grow up. Mauritius and Namibia are said to have the best systems for child protection.</p>
<p>To be sure, Eritrea&#8217;s neighbor, Ethiopia, has also been given a less child-friendly mark (41st in the list) under an internationally recognized measurement system involving 40 pointers including access to health care and education as well as adoption and implementation of laws and policies that protect children from abuse, exploitation and violence.</p>
<p>Much has been written about each of the 54 African nations regarding their respective obligations to protect their children. However, discussing the Eritrean case a little further is appropriate here because children&#8217;s rights are also human rights and Eritrea is known to be the worst violator of human rights on the continent.</p>
<p>For Eritrea not to be able to feed its people by all means necessary is the worst violation of human rights. The UN estimates 75 percent of the Eritrean people need food aid. The first victims of a food shortage are children. Children&#8217;s anxieties of whether there will be bread tomorrow are the worst fears they can have.</p>
<p>It is unethical for the Eritrean government to keep expelling NGO&#8217;s (Non-Governmental Organizations) and governmental and other food donor agencies while the people are still hungry and its mismanaged, self-reliance based agricultural policies have failed.</p>
<p>Equally unethical and immoral is the government&#8217;s heavy expenditure on armaments and its funneling of funds and expensive weapons to rebel movements in the Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia while neglecting the need to invest in the country&#8217;s future by investing in its children.</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s biggest dream in Eritrea is to get out of the country because their parents and the government have left them without any hope to live for. An Eritrean teen-age girl&#8217;s aspiration is not to continue with her school but to find some foreign tourist who would care to have unprotected sex with her in order to get pregnant and have a child while she works out future plans to leave the country hopefully with the help of the tourist. She doesn&#8217;t see herself becoming a wife of the handsome young man next door who has not enough to eat let alone support a wife and a child.</p>
<p>There was a report that came my way the other day of a 16 year old Eritrean who managed to leave her country after marrying a much older European citizen who was visiting Eritrea. Gladly, in this case, the marriage, though legal, has not and will not be consummated in order to protect the short and long term interests of the child.</p>
<p>Many Eritreans have perished in hostile African deserts and open seas trying to reach places of hope, peace and freedom including the young Eritrean mother who was fatally shot earlier this year by Egyptian troops as she tried to enter Israel via the Sinai Desert with her two terrorized children standing by her side.</p>
<p>Leaving ethics aside, this state of affairs is objectionable even from the point of view of the most selfish national interest that any government wishes to support. The Eritrean government&#8217;s unwillingness to uphold human rights and its failure to protect and invest in its children are strategically and politically untenable seriously undermining national interest and dashing the hope to build a peaceful, united and democratic future. The government has scrambled its priorities and it has the duty to swiftly unscramble them.</p>
