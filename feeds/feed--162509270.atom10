It was co-written by Black Web 2.0 General Manager Markus Robinson.</em></p>
<p><img class="shot2" src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/angela-benton.jpg" alt="" />The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/08/blackbird-is-a-custom-browser-for-african-americans-built-on-top-of-mozilla/">release of Blackbird, an African American focused web browser</a> sparked quite a bit of controversy this past week. The TechCrunch post about it elicited reactions from both sides of the aisle (it has 275 comments and counting). Some argued for the value of niche audiences while others debated that the idea of a Black browser is in and of itself separatism, racist even. But catering to niche audiences online is nothing new. In fact, browsers that focus on a specific market segment isn&#8217;t all that new either. For example there&#8217;s <a href="http://browser.flock.com/gloss" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/browser.flock.com');">Gloss</a>, a women focused fashion and beauty browser created using Flock, the social media browser. But what makes the launch of <a href="http://www.blackbirdhome.com/about.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.blackbirdhome.com');">Blackbird</a> both a controversial and sensitive topic, is that it is focused towards an ethnic segment versus a special interest group.  Race is still an extremely touchy subject in America, and the Internet and web are not immune to this sensitivity regardless of how open it is.  But aren&#8217;t most businesses, especially web businesses, started in this &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; era defined by catering to a particular niche?</p>
<p>Really, if race-based niche sites are racist, then this inflated &#8220;Web 2.0 bubble&#8221; has played a major role in the segregation of the web overall.  Many of the sites we all follow right here on TechCrunch, like Digg, Techmeme, and Mixx, were built and launched to service a niche, therefore fragmenting the web making it so we all think it&#8217;s &#8220;more personal&#8221; and &#8220;more authentic.&#8221; Remember when <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/26/global-grind-ajax-finally-for-the-hip-hop-demographic/">Global Grind</a> was once the more authentic counterpart to Pageflakes for the hip-hop culture?  Or how about the collaborative advice site for parenting <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/minti-niche-web-20-stuff-is-coming/">Minti</a> that was described by Mike Arrington as a &#8220;walled garden&#8221; even though he &#8220;&#8230;like(s) to see niche content sites spring up that use Web 2.0 ideas - these services will help the masses start to use and understand things like tagging, ajax, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>While niche sites like the newly launched <a href="http://CodeBlack.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/CodeBlack.com');">CodeBlack.com</a> which is described as the <a href="http://greasyguide.com/2008/12/11/codeblackcom-the-black-amazoncom/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/greasyguide.com');">&#8220;Black Amazon.com&#8221;</a> will always have the debate of whether it is really needed; CodeBlack&#8217;s CEO Quincy Newell thinks otherwise:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In general there should be something for everyone, we are living in a society where it&#8217;s okay to have something for everyone.  Everyone is welcomed.  The intent is to serve the need and/or perspective, not to exclude.  We aren&#8217;t entering the market to be the &#8216;Black Amazon&#8217; we entered to give back in the form of opportunities created for our community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Newell believes his service provides opportunity by giving film makers and authors without major distribution deals the ability to distribute their content to an audience who may be interested in it.  A portion of the proceeds from purchases from the site also go to the United Negro College Fund Scholarship.</p>
<p>In the case of CodeBlack, it is less of an Amazon and more of a Netflix (<a href="http://www.blackweb20.com/2008/09/26/code-black-enterprises-launches-interactive-division/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.blackweb20.com');">or even Hulu</a>) which, from a business perspective, is a good niche to be in.  Last time I checked &#8220;Watch Instantly&#8221; in Netflix there were (count&#8217;em) 34 African-American Comedy movies available to watch instantly.  A quick search on Hulu for the comedian Sommore brought back about 12 TV Clips, but how many Movie Clips?  Zero.  So perhaps the real argument is being positioned as the Black &#8220;Insert Mainstream website.&#8221;  I am no different.  My own site is often referred to as the Black &#8220;TechCrunch&#8221; by others and even by my team and I.  No jab here, TC, but we aren&#8217;t.  We are actually quite different.  However it is a quick and easy way to help someone associate a concept they may not fully understand off the top with something that is much more familiar to them.</p>
<p>The point: how can we ALL move past the thought of a niche application or site being separatist?  Today most of us can see past race, and I say most because racism does still exist.  Brown vs The Board of Education integrated schools so we could all learn equally, together.  We are a better society today because of this.  What Brown vs the Board of Education did for society and integrating school systems, services like Facebook Connect, Google Friend Connect, and Open Social will do for this very fragmented web we weave now.  There is no doubt that services such as these will integrate the web regardless of race, niche, special interest, or application preference.</p>
<p>Facebook doesn&#8217;t discriminate against non-college students. Yahoo&#8217;s Shine isn&#8217;t sexist. Christian Café doesn&#8217;t discriminate against Muslims.  Gay.com doesn&#8217;t discriminate against heterosexuals and Black websites and applications aren&#8217;t racist.  It&#8217;s less about race and more about people wanting to share with people more like them whether that means common interests, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality or skin color, etc.  And by the way: everyone is doing it. Its the new Black.</p>

The idea behind <a href="http://www.leveragecard.com/home.htm">Leverage</a> was simple and had some potential: it offered an advanced management system for gift cards, hugely popular worldwide especially this time of year, so you could register all of them and keep track of how much you have left or stored on each one. You were also able to buy gift cards, or swap them with others. The service also let you manage all of your loyalty reward programs, such as frequent-flyer or frequent-stay plans.

Leverage, which was founded in May 2005 and had raised $2 million in angel funding, planned to generate revenue by reselling gift cards (see our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/23/manage-those-holiday-gift-cards-with-leverage/">launch coverage</a> for more).

<blockquote><p>With VC funding freezing up and retail revenues down, the company can&#8217;t afford to keep any of us on payroll. The owners are hoping this is just a temporary lay-off, that they will get funded again after the holidays, and be able to hire us all back.</p></blockquote>

The pink slips were passed out on Thursday throughout the various business duchies that make up <a href=" http://www.cbs.com/sales/">CBS Interactive</a>—CNET, CBS.com, CBSNews,com, CBSSports.com, BNET, GameSpot, TV.com, last.fm, and CHOW.  While CBS confirmed to me and other reporters that layoffs did happen across the board, it refused to talk about how many total people are losing their jobs.  That left us scrambling about gathering piecemeal information.  There were about <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/11/layoffs-at-lastfm-confirmed-where-else-are-heads-rolling-at-cbs/">20 layoffs at Last.fm</a>; 8 editors, we hear, at CBSNews.com are out of a job; another set of "redundancies" were eliminated at CBSSports.com.

<p>But how big exactly were the layoffs, especially at Cnet, where most of the employees reside?  CBS, which is at heart a news organization, doesn&#8217;t want the public to know how many layoffs just occurred at CBS Interactive.  As of this writing, Cnet <a href="http://news.cnet.com/1770-5_3-0.html?query=cbs&#038;tag=srch&#038;searchtype=news" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/news.cnet.com');">didn&#8217;t even report</a> the fact that there were layoffs on Thursday.

And it&#8217;s not because they didn&#8217;t get the memo (from CBS Interactive CEO Quincy Smith, reprinted below).  </p>
<p>One rumor going around, which I heard as well, was that there were <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/12/11/cbs-interactive-cuts-as-much-as-20-percent/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/gigaom.com');">20 percent cuts</a> in all business units (which was in line with the cuts at Last.fm).  But that percentage turns out to be a bit high.  According to a source inside Cnet, the buzz is that the total number of employees asked to leave today was &#8220;275-ish.&#8221; A CBS spokesperson wouldn&#8217;t confirm that number.  So take it as a rough estimate. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect a press release or even a footnote in CBS Corporation&#8217;s SEC filings either.  CBS as a whole employed nearly 24,000 people at the end of 2007 (the last figure I can find), so 275 is barley one percent.  That is not material, and thus the company is not required to report it.  But for CBS Interactive, it is material—about 10 percent or higher.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I get at that figure.  The vast majority of employees are at Cnet, which if you look at the <a href=" http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1015577/000119312508040260/d10k.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.sec.gov');">last 10K</a> it filed with the SEC, lists 2,700 employees at the end of 2007.  There was at least <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/26/cnet-cuts-10-of-workforce-effective-immediately/">one round of layoffs</a> at Cnet in March, 2008, which reduced headcount by 120.    And a CBS Interactive spokesperson told me today that before Cnet was acquired in July, 2008, it had 2,000 to 2,500 employees.  But that was more a guesstimate than a hard number.  Figure some more attrition, then give or take a few hundred employees at the other CBS properties, and that puts the total employee count back somewhere between 2,300 and 2,700.  Sticking with the 275 layoffs, that represents between 10 and 12 percent.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve updated our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/layoffs/">Layoff Tracker</a> with this estimate.</p>
<p>Below is the memo Quincy Smith sent on Thursday afternoon to all CBS Interactive employees, delivering the layoff news in the vaguest terms as part of a progress report. Basically, everywhere he is combining business units (in sports, games, music, lifestyle, entertainment, news, marketing, and biz dev), people are losing jobs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>From: Quincy and Neil<br />
Date: Thu, 11 Dec 2008 16:33:25 -0800<br />
Subject: CBS Interactive Update</p>
<p>Team,</p>
<p>As we come to the end of 2008, we have a lot to be proud of.  CBS Interactive is the best online content network for information and entertainment.  Our properties are expanding, advertisers are capitalizing on our properties and their scale, and we are positioned well to continue to grow.  As we prepare for 2009 and beyond, we’d like to update you on this progress, announce some organizational changes and comment on the broader market environment and how it impacts CBS Interactive.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<p>CBS Interactive is the 8th largest Internet network in the world.  Our combined traffic is up nearly 30% since we closed the merger this summer. CNET, CBSSports.com, BNET, GameSpot, TV.com, CBS.com, last.fm, and CHOW have each had record traffic within the past three months.  Our commitment to our users is paying off.</p>
<p>Advertisers have noticed.  We have recently signed and announced deals across several of our properties with Microsoft, AT&#038;T, Intel, Bertolli, EA, and GM. In these challenging economic times, marketers are consolidating their efforts with their best partners.  Our properties, our audiences, our ideas and our insights will continue to differentiate us in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Finally, we have contributed to and benefited from the TV and Radio divisions of CBS.  We’ve done nearly 1500 purpose-driven promotions to our properties on Broadcast TV, Radio and local TV Stations; CHOW and GameSpot content is running on the CBS Outernet; and CNET ran a major consumer campaign in markets like New York and San Francisco through CBS Outdoor. CBS Interactive is also a key partner to CBS Television Network for major broadcast events. In just the last week, we featured complementary content for events including The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, the Grammy Nominations and the SEC Championship.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we have a lot to look forward to. Events like CES, The Grammys, and March Madness on Demand are all just around the corner.  Each represent huge cross-platform opportunities where CBS Interactive will again help complete the experience with coverage on air, online, and on mobile for our audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Promotions and Changes</strong></p>
<p>As we enter 2009, we are making some changes to our organizational structure to capitalize on audience and advertiser overlaps.  We are also making some changes to key functions so that we can realize the benefits of our position in the marketplace.   These changes mark another significant milestone in our integration, as we fine-tune our organization to best take advantage of the power of our entire network.  </p>
<p><strong>Sports, Games and Music</strong></p>
<p>We are combining our Sports, Games and Music properties into a single group led by Steve Snyder.  Steve has tremendous product and leadership experience and an enthusiasm for each of these categories.   In addition, Tom Jones will be moving over from CNET to head-up the sales efforts for this group.  Within the group, our talented senior leaders including Jason Kint, Rich Calacci, Jaci Hays, Kevin Menard, Felix Miller, Doug Schmidt and others will report to Steve and to Tom.  </p>
<p><strong>Entertainment &#038; Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>We are also moving our Lifestyle properties, CHOW and UrbanBaby, to the Entertainment group (TV.com, CBS.com, The CBS Audience Network and TheInsider.com) to capitalize on the similarities in audience and advertisers. This group will continue to be led by Anthony Soohoo with sales led by Ken Lagana.  We’re excited to see the innovation that will come from this group in 2009.  </p>
<p><strong>Technology &#038; News</strong></p>
<p>Under the continued leadership of Joe Gillespie, our Technology &#038; News division will bring CBSNews.com and CNET News.com into a single CBS Interactive News Group.  Each site will maintain its own brand identity, while benefiting from shared resources in design, product and engineering to deliver deeper and more comprehensive coverage of major stories and events.  Led by Mark Larkin, with Dan Farber as Editor-in-Chief, CBS News.com and CNET News.com will also have the opportunity to share content and collaborate on stories for the benefit of their unique audiences.  </p>
<p><strong>CBS Interactive Marketing</strong></p>
<p>We are bringing together our key marketing functions into a new group called CBS Interactive Marketing led by Mickey Wilson.  The group brings together expertise from across the organization so that we can capitalize on our biggest opportunities, and elevate the company to be a strategic marketing partner whose products, consumer insights, and ad innovations are critical to our clients’ long-term success.  They will establish the company as the standard for premium content online, and define and evolve brand strategies to capture the biggest opportunities for audience and revenue growth through market planning, insights and execution.  </p>
<p><strong>CBS Interactive Business Development</strong></p>
<p>We are also bringing together all of our business development activities. This group will be led by Mike Marquez.  Mike and his team will be responsible for the development of all new partnerships, investments, and acquisitions.   They will be charged with taking advantage of knowledge sharing across the whole company to ensure that we are the strategic partner of choice for the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Market Conditions</strong></p>
<p>As you know the general economic environment continues to be a challenge.  We have always been very aggressive about managing our costs, and that requirement is even more critical now than it has ever been.  We believe this new, more efficient organizational structure will produce better results for CBS Interactive, and also result in lower operating costs. It is always very difficult to make these kinds of reductions, but they come after a thorough review of how we are organized and how we operate, and what best serves our many users, advertisers and employees.</p>
<p>CBS Interactive is a special place because of you, and we thank each of you for what you have done, are doing, and will do to exceed the expectations of the tens of millions of people who come to our properties every day.</p>
<p>Today, we sit in a great position. People seek out our brands because we provide them with the information and entertainment they want and need, and marketers seek us out because of the powerful audiences we attract.  We are positioned to grow in 2009 and beyond.</p>
<p>Best,<br />

<a href="http://www.partybeans.com">PartyBeans</a>, a new startup launching today to the public, has created a WYSIWYG interface for candies that makes it easy to order personalized tins of Jelly Bellys, mints, and gum.  The first 500 TechCrunch readers to check out the site can get 15% off their orders with the promo code "TECHCRUNCH".

The site allows users to add their own logos or photos to the tops of their candy containers, along with a few lines of text.  Each candy also has a few customization options - you can choose if you'd like your Jelly Bellys to come as a standard random sampling, or in a flavor or two of your choosing.  The site plans to introduce more candies and options in the near future.]]></description>

<p><a href="http://www.partybeans.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.partybeans.com');">PartyBeans</a>, a new startup launching today to the public, has created a WYSIWYG interface for candies that makes it easy to order personalized tins of Jelly Bellys, mints, and gum.

<p>There are countless other custom confection sites out there (you can see a sampling of them <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=custom+candy" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.google.com');">here</a>), but many of them have minimum order sizes and cater primarily to large events like weddings.  PartyBeans is trying to appeal to more casual purchasers, who can buy as little as one item at a time (you can get a custom Jelly Belly tin for as little as $5, including shipping).  In my testing the site seemed to work quite well - it took me only a few minutes to create my own jar of green and white TechCrunch Jelly Bellys, and I&#8217;ll probably be ordering a few more tins for the holidays.</p>

With <a href="http://qik.com/">Qik</a>, <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/">Kyte</a>, and <a href="http://www.flixwagon.com/">FlixWagon</a> all battling for their share of the live mobile broadcasting market, is there room for another contender? <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">Ustream.tv</a> seems to think so. We've just received word (and even better, video) of a Ustream.tv mobile client already in the works. 

While details are still somewhat sparse, we're hearing that Ustream.tv's got at least one trick up their sleeve to make their offering stand out: drastically shorter delays in getting your live content onto viewer's screens.

More layoffs today at <a href="http://www.divx.com/">DivX</a>, the publicly traded video codec supplier that recently sued Yahoo over <a href="http://www.isedb.com/db/articles/1923/1/DivX-Sues-Yahoo-Over-Cancelled-Advertisement-Deal/Page1.html">canceling a contract</a> that makes up as much as 20 percent of its revenue.  According to a tip that came into our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/layoffs/">Layoff Tracker</a>, 21 people were let go.  I just confirmed that until-now unannounced number with DivX investor relations.  It represents just under 10 percent of the workforce in San Diego, where DivX is based (although there were some cuts globally as well).  

Its <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DIVX">stock</a> is trading under $5, about a third of where it was a year ago.

Google's Chrome browser is officially ready for prime time.  As we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/10/google-takes-chrome-out-of-beta/">reported</a> earlier this week, Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-chrome-beta.html">dropped the Browser's Beta label</a> after a mere 14 weeks (many Google products, like Gmail, have been billed as Betas for years).  The browser now claims over 10 million active users worldwide.  

Since launching, Chrome has implemented a number of major bug fixes (audio and video are less glitchy), increased performance on the browser's V8 JavaScript engine, added a bookmark manager, and introduced UI changes to make privacy settings more accessible.  The company's blog post also says that an extension platform (similar to Firefox's add-ons) is on the way.  Mac and Linux versions are still nowhere to be seen.

<p>Google&#8217;s Chrome browser is officially ready for prime time.  As we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/10/google-takes-chrome-out-of-beta/">reported</a> earlier this week, Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-chrome-beta.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/googleblog.blogspot.com');">dropped the Browser&#8217;s Beta label</a> after a mere 14 weeks (many Google products, like Gmail, have been billed as Betas for years).  The browser now claims over 10 million active users worldwide.  </p>
<p>Since launching, Chrome has implemented a number of major bug fixes (audio and video are less glitchy), increased performance on the browser&#8217;s V8 JavaScript engine, added a bookmark manager, and introduced UI changes to make privacy settings more accessible.  The company&#8217;s blog post also says that an extension platform (similar to Firefox&#8217;s add-ons) is on the way.  Mac and Linux versions are still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/10/marissa-mayer-at-le-web-the-almost-complete-interview/">our talk</a> at LeWeb with Marissa Mayer, Google’s VP of Search Product and User Experience, we learned that the (relatively) quick turnaround is due to the fact that Chrome is a client software application.  Many OEMs won&#8217;t touch software that is still in Beta, so Google had an incentive to conduct a thorough but finite testing Beta program.  Conversely, cloud-based apps like Gmail can retain their Beta status indefinitely so long as Google feels that there are still major features that should be added.</p>
<p>So how has Google Chrome fared?  It was clear from the get-go that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/02/giving-google-chrome-a-spin-this-thing-moves-fast/">this thing was fast</a>, touting new features and enhanced stability that made it a great new entry into the browser market.  Within a few days after launch the browser made up <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/04/google-analytics-now-tracks-chrome-our-share-623/">6.23% of our traffic</a> - a few weeks later it was up to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/16/update-on-techcrunch-reader-chrome-usage-trending-up-to-812/">8.12%</a>.  Some analysts guessed that it might even be able to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/03/lehman-googles-chrome-can-catch-up-to-firefox-in-two-years/">overtake Firefox</a> within the next two years.</p>
<p>But since then that number has fallen to around 6% of our total traffic - nearly three times more than Opera, but well below Safari (9.87%), Internet Explorer (28.37%), and Firefox (52.05%).  For a browser that is only a few months old this is still an impressive feat, but for Chrome to take on Internet Explorer (which is Google&#8217;s ultimate goal), Chrome&#8217;s market share needs to be showing consistent growth.  TechCrunch traffic is by no means representative of the web as a whole (a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/137084/2008/11/safari.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.macworld.com');">recent report</a> pegs Chrome&#8217;s overall US market share at .62% vs 81.36% for IE), but a large number of early adopters read this site and may be indicative of future trends.</p>

When Virgin Mobile acquired Helio earlier this year, they also acquired a nice big pile of $50 AmEx gift cards intended for use in Helio promotions. The downside? They expire at the end of 2008. In an effort to make sure the cards don't go to waste and to make December just a wee bit brighter for a handful of MobileCrunch readers, they sent a pack of cards our way. We'll be giving them out through a series of contests for the next few days, with at least one giveaway each day.

Today, CBS Interactive is laying off people across several of its properties, I've confirmed with the company.  CBS is not saying which divisions or how many people are affected.  It is positioning the layoffs as part of the integration process it began six months ago when it bought CNET for $1.8 billion.  But it is not just the CNET businesses that are being cut.  


I've also confirmed that earlier today employees at social music site Last.FM were let go.  CBS bought Last.fm in 2007 for <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/cbs-acquires-lastfm-for-280m/">$280 million</a>.  One source puts the number of layoffs at as many as 40 people, mostly from LAst.FM's London HQ, which has a <a href="http://www.last.fm/about/team">total staff of 95</a>.  A spokesperson for CBS Interactive says that number is inaccurate on the high side, but won't provide the correct number. In any case, it is likely a small fraction of the overall number of employees being laid off across CBS Interactive.  <strong>Update</strong>:  CBS says the number of Last.fm layoffs is less than 20, which would put it at about 20 percent.]]></description>

<p>Today, CBS Interactive is laying off people across several of its properties, I&#8217;ve confirmed with the company.  CBS is not saying which divisions or how many people are affected.  It is positioning the layoffs as part of the integration process it began six months ago when it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/15/cbs-to-acquire-cnet-for-18-billion/">bought CNET</a> for $1.8 billion.  But it is not just the CNET businesses that are being cut.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also confirmed that earlier today employees at social music site Last.FM were let go.  CBS bought Last.fm in 2007 for <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/cbs-acquires-lastfm-for-280m/">$280 million</a>.  One source puts the number of layoffs at as many as 40 people, mostly from LAst.FM&#8217;s London HQ, which has a <a href="http://www.last.fm/about/team" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.last.fm');">total staff of 95</a>.  A spokesperson for CBS Interactive says that number is inaccurate on the high side, but won&#8217;t provide the correct number. In any case, it is likely a small fraction of the overall number of employees being laid off across CBS Interactive.  <strong>Update</strong>:  CBS says the number of Last.fm layoffs is less than 20, which would put it at about 20 percent.</p>
<p>Last.fm never really became a big money maker from what I can gather, and all of those engineers and other staff members are not cheap.  Even after a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/17/lastfms-buggy-new-design/">redesign</a> last July, growth has been flat.  According to comScore, Last.fm had 9.2 million global unique visitors in October, a 6 percent increase from July.  Imeem is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/15/lastfm-needs-more-than-a-redesign-to-catch-up-to-imeem/">still much more popular</a>, with 22.1 million global visitors.  And in the U.S., even Pandora has a bigger audience (4.97 million uniques in November, versus 2.75 million, see chart below).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/lastfm-pandora-imeem.png"/></p>
<p>If you know which other CBS Interactive divisions are going through layoffs today or the total number of layoffs, leave us a <a href="mailto:tips@techcrunch.com?subject=Layoffs Tip">tip</a> and we will add it to our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/layoffs/">Layoff Tracker</a>.  <strong>Update 2</strong>:  There were also layoffs at CBS Sports where, a tipster who is a former employee tells us, &#8220;the entire accounting department&#8221; was lost, as well as jobs in Database Applications and Data Warehouse .</p>
<p>The Last.fm staff learned about the layoffs a little more than an hour ago.  Below is a screenshot from one of their friends, showing their reaction on Facebook.  That first status message is in Swedish and says, &#8220;better start planning for the future.&#8221;  <strong>Update 3</strong>: Matt Hillman says that his status message below was not related to the layoffs.</p>

<p>Facebook is also quickly closing the gap in U.S. usage v. MySpace. Facebook became the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/12/facebook-no-longer-the-second-largest-social-network/">largest worldwide social network</a> last April, when they overtook MySpace. </p>
<p>MySpace continues to dominate in the U.S., with 75 million monthly visitors (Comscore). A year ago Facebook had just 35 million monthly U.S. visitors, compared to MySpace&#8217;s 69 million, meaning MySpace was about twice the size of Facebook in the U.S. Two months ago Facebook had risen to just 40 million users, and MySpace had grown to 75 million, so the ratio was still hovering around 50% (53% to be exact).</p>
<p>But in the last two months Facebook has added nearly 10 million monthly U.S. users, surging to 50 million U.S. visitors in November. MySpace has stayed steady, but the Facebook is now 2/3 the size of MySpace in the U.S.</p>
<p>If Facebook&#8217;s growth rate v. MySpace in the U.S. continues, they&#8217;ll overtake them sometime next year. </p>

After showing <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/15/twitters-hockey-stick-moment/">hockey-stick growth</a> leading up to the U.S. Presidential Elections, Twitter took a breather in November.  According to comScore, unique U.S. visitors to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> grew less than one percent sequentially from October to 1.466 million.  U.S. pageviews declined more precipitously to 19.7 million, from 37.2 million in October (a 47 percent decline).  

These numbers suggest that about the same number of people are still visiting Twitter, but without all the election Tweets, they are only finding half as much to keep them interested.]]></description>

<p>After showing <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/15/twitters-hockey-stick-moment/">hockey-stick growth</a> leading up to the U.S. Presidential Elections, Twitter took a breather in November.  According to comScore, unique U.S. visitors to <a href="http://twitter.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/twitter.com');">Twitter.com</a> grew less than one percent sequentially from October to 1.466 million.  U.S. pageviews declined more precipitously to 19.7 million, from 37.2 million in October (a 47 percent decline).  </p>
<p>These numbers suggest that about the same number of people are still visiting Twitter, but without all the election Tweets, they are only finding half as much to keep them interested.  Remember, this is just a proxy for Twitter activity, as it only estimates visits to the site, and does not take into account all of the other clients and sites where people consume their Twitter feeds.</p>
<p>If Twitter is taking a breather, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.huffingtonpost.com');">HuffingtonPost</a> is winded.  The political uber-blog saw a 20 percent decline in unique U.S. visitors from October to November.  U.S unique visitors went from 5 million to 4 million, according to comScore.   And U.S. pageviews are down 33 percent to 43 million.  (Yeah, we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/21/in-the-afterglow-of-the-election-huffpo-looks-to-raise-15-million/">saw this coming</a>).  Meanwhile, CNN.com was able to build on its election momentum and broader news coverage to grow its U.S. audience 11.4 percent month-over-month to 27.4 million (although pageviews are down 14 percent). </p>
<p>Good thing HuffingtonPost <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/01/the-huffington-post-raises-25-million-from-oak-investment-partners/">raised $25 million</a> before the numbers turned south.  Now it has to readjust to the post-election environment and broaden its coverage as well.  </p>

Doh. Domain squatters snatched away the domain name GeorgeWBushLibrary.com and made an easy $34,990 profit on promptly selling it to back to Yuma Solutions, the web development company that let it expire. Yuma has been a contractor for the Bush family for quite some time, and the domain name they accidentally let expire belonged to the George W. Bush Library Foundation.  It originally bought the domain in 2007 from another squatter for $3,000.

It looks like Yuma is going to have to eat the cost of not renewing the domain.]]></description>

<p>It looks like Yuma is going to have to eat the cost of not renewing the domain.</p>
<p>The <em>Dallas Morning News</em> <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/yahoolatestnews/stories/121108dnmetbushweb.3d4b3ac.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.dallasnews.com');">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mark Langdale, president of the George W. Bush Library Foundation, said Tuesday that he didn&#8217;t know about the Web site being lost and recovered. But, he said, he would know if the library had been stuck with a surprise $35,000 expenditure.</p></blockquote>
<p>The name of the squatter who so adeptly flipped the URL is, appropriately enough, <a href="http://www.ill-k.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.ill-k.com');">Illuminati Karate</a> (which is another Web design firm in Raleigh, North Carolina).

<a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, one of the companies that significantly lowered the bar for starting a blog, has just raised $4.5 million in a Series B round led by Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital, the same investors that put in $750,000 in the first round. CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-karp">David Karp</a> says the investment will give the startup a runway of at least two and a half years, and is introducing paid features at the same time.

Furthermore, former Time Warner technology SVP (and current CEO of Betaworks) <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-borthwick-2">John Borthwick</a> is joining the board, while former CNET director John Maloney will act as the New York-based company's President.

Tumblr serves zero ads on it pages, and generated an equal amount of dollars so far. Now, Tumblr will have premium services to make up for that, although it's unclear what the services will be exactly. Karp did mention they were gonna be 'sexy', so we're moderately curious now.]]></description>

<p>In a release, Tumblr is claimed to have over 15 million monthly unique visitors, but those numbers sound a bit inflated if you ask us. ComScore measures 1.5 million global unique visitors in October, a 300 percent increase from a year ago (see chart).  Nonetheless, it had great momentum from the moment it launched in 2007, and there&#8217;s still a lot of potential users out there. If they will continue to come, and if they will be able to make the company profitable, remains to be seen.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/crash.jpg'class="shot" alt="" />The government is issuing around 240,000 tickets to President Elect Obama's inauguration on January 20. But many more people than that want to be there, and there are plenty of parties and other activities for them to attend. The big problem, though, is finding a place to stay.

Hotels were sold out long ago, and without a place to stay it's basically impossible to be there. That's where <a href="http://www.crashtheinauguration.com/">CrashTheInaguration</a> comes in. The site is powered by <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/11/airbed-and-breakfast-takes-pad-crashing-to-a-whole-new-level/">AirBed &#038; Breakfast, which we covered in August</a>.

The service lets people rent out rooms or their entire home to travelers. Unlike services like <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">CouchSurfing</a>, they can also charge for the service, so it effectively lets anyone who wants to launch their own hotel in their home. AirBed &#038; Breakfast charges a fee that averages around 10%; the rest goes to the person renting the room.

Cofounder Brian Chesky says that over 2,000 rooms have been listed for rent since the service launched. Later today CNN will be doing a segment on the CrashTheInauguration service, and I expect the number of listings to jump up sharply.

<a href="http://www.tuneupmedia.com">TuneUp</a>, an iTunes plugin that helps correct wrong or missing song meta data and album art (and also offers a number of complementary features) has released a Mac-compatible version to the public.  

We originally covered TuneUp last May (click <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/12/tuneup-brings-order-to-your-itunes-library-for-a-fee/">here</a> to see our full overview of the features), and since then not much has changed in terms of the plugin's functionality.  The application sits as a sidebar alongside iTunes, allowing users to simply drag and drop songs from their playlists into appropriate boxes to have their meta tags 'cleaned up' or cover art downloaded automatically.  The sidebar also includes a panel called 'Now Playing' that features YouTube videos along with album and song recommendations related the song currently playing.  Finally, there's a tab for 'Concerts' which offers a listing of upcoming concerts in your area.]]></description>

The application sits as a sidebar alongside iTunes, allowing users to simply drag and drop songs from their playlists into appropriate boxes to have their meta tags &#8216;cleaned up&#8217; or cover art downloaded automatically.  The sidebar also includes a panel called &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; that features YouTube videos along with album and song recommendations related the song currently playing.  Finally, there&#8217;s a tab for &#8216;Concerts&#8217; which offers a listing of upcoming concerts in your area.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tuneupshot.png" class="shot"/></p>
<p>The free download includes 500 free song corrections (which fixes meta data and album art), as well as 50 free album art corrections (which just fixes album art and ignores meta data).  After that, the service costs $12 for an annual subscription or $20 for a lifetime membership.  Data lookup generally works well, and uses information licensed from <a href="http://www.gracenote.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.gracenote.com');">Gracenote</a>.</p>
<p>When we covered the Windows application earlier this year my biggest concern was that few people would be willing to pay for what for many will be a one-time fix - TuneUp does offer some value after fixing your library with its &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; and &#8216;Concerts&#8217; tabs, but most people are just concerned with cleaning up their libraries, which only needs to be done once.  TuneUp&#8217;s Andrew Kippen says that while this was a major concern for the company, the conversion rate from free to paid users has actually been five times higher than expected (though he wouldn&#8217;t give any specific numbers).</p>

YouTube has just launched a new <a href="http://help.youtube.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?contact_type=abuse&#038;hl=en-US">Abuse And Safety Center</a> meant to help make the site as safe as possible for families (YouTube is only meant for ages 13+, but kids still flock to the site in droves).  While the site has previously offered safety guidelines, they used to be bundled in the same section as product help and had far less information.  The new section offers tips from organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the National Crime Prevention Council.

<p>YouTube has just launched a new <a href="http://help.youtube.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?contact_type=abuse&#038;hl=en-US" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/help.youtube.com');">Abuse And Safety Center</a> meant to help make the site as safe as possible for families (YouTube is only meant for ages 13+, but kids still flock to the site in droves).  While the site has previously offered safety guidelines, they used to be bundled in the same section as product help and had far less information.  The new section offers tips from organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the National Crime Prevention Council. </p>
<p>After entering the Abuse and Safety Center, users are presented with a list of common issues, including Privacy Concerns, Cyberbullying, and Hateful Content.  After selecting one of these items, the site displays a list of tips and guidelines from the aforementioned expert agencies, as well as a video guides in some cases.  Most of the topics are directly related to YouTube, but they are also relevant to the web as a whole.</p>
<p>The new Center also offers a Help and Safety tool that makes it easier to manage irritating or malicious comments and also gives users more control over who can contact them through private messages.  Users can now search for all comments left by a given user across their entire channel, allowing them to see if any commentors are making a habit of repeatedly harassing them on their videos.  From there, it&#8217;s a simple process to delete multiple comments at once or ban that user entirely from the channel.</p>
