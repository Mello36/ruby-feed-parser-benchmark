Although I'm a big supporter of environmental issues and started my career &lt;a href="http://www.cwec.ca/"&gt;running an environmental organization&lt;/a&gt;, I would like to focus on eco-marketing in terms of demand creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I focused my research this week on how I can help my customers build out a &lt;a href="http://blog.bulldogsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/sd_mql_sal_sql.jpg"&gt;demand waterfall &lt;/a&gt;as defined by the smart people over at &lt;a href="http://www.siriusdecisions.com/"&gt;SiriusDecisions&lt;/a&gt;. During my research, I stumbled upon a great article by the Canadian Marketing Blog called "&lt;a href="http://www.canadianmarketingblog.com/archives/2008/10/2009_btob_demand_creation_tren.html"&gt;2009 B-to-B Demand Creation Trends&lt;/a&gt;" eh (Canadian joke). It's here where I came across the term eco-marketer and I wanted to build on the excellent analysis that they have already provided. However, after I drank 10 cups of coffee, I've created my own version of the eco-marketer. Here are my three Rs that I recommend to become the best eco-marketer you can be in a down economy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Three Rs of Marketing and a Bonus R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reuse&lt;/span&gt;: In a down economy you need to reuse all of your marketing resources that you have out there and maximize your marketing investments. Here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reuse your webinars&lt;/span&gt;. If you have run a live webinar, post the archived version on your website behind a form. It's been proven that archived webinars can generate more leads then the actual live event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reuse your email newsletters by ensuring they are posted on your website&lt;/span&gt;. This is a simple one but it's surprising how many e-newsletters remain only in email format. I would recommend to post in on your website and even create an RSS feed. With an RSS feed, you can promote in your email footers and it can be re-used by other bloggers and companies. You should even consider creating a blog and &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/03/latest-trends-in-email-marketing-rss.html"&gt;reposting your newsletter&lt;/a&gt; articles on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reuse your live presentations&lt;/span&gt;. If anyone from your company or your customers are speaking on behalf of your company ensure that you film them and add them to the resource area of your website. You can even just post the slides or the speech text. Don't miss these great opportunities to build marketing content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Use social media techniques such as &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/11/obama-beats-mccain-on-twitter.html"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/search/label/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; to maximize the effect of your webinars, videos and white papers&lt;/span&gt;. For example, you can &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chadhorenfeldt/status/1009127107"&gt;mention on your twitter profile&lt;/a&gt; that you've just released a new blog post or newsletter. Think of social media as a big marketing ecosystem (see, I am focusing on the environment) and make sure you take advantage of all the tools out there. In this way, you can reuse your marketing materials as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reuse all of your marketing materials in your lead nurturing efforts&lt;/span&gt;. Having the right content for automated lead nurturing programs can be the most difficult part of a lead nurturing campaign. However, many companies have all of the materials they need already created. Even though some may be dated, if the materials are good they should be reused. You don't need to just focus on pushing out new content, you probably have some gold nuggets that may be hidden on your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your nuturing campaigns, create a document that outlines all of the marketing content that you have and map this to the buying process of your target audiences that you have identified (assuming you have created defined marketing segments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be amazed at how you can reuse the content you already have (blog posts, newsletter articles, industry white papers, demos) and create a specific and defined automated program that is designed to target a specific segment and has a specific marketing goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Create marketing campaigns that can be reused&lt;/span&gt;. For example, if you have a large marketing team, create processes so that you standardize your email and landing page templates. Tweak them as necessary based on your successes (or failures). Another example is to create automated program templates such as an event management or lead nurturing template. These templates can be copied and reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reuse (and abuse) your whole company&lt;/span&gt;. If you have Jimmy from the development team who did a lunch and learn on how he coded a solution that will benefit your clients, get him to write it down and post it on a blog. If Sarah from your Support team came up with a great solution to solve a customer problem, video tape her and post it on your site or include it in your next newsletter. MAXIMIZE YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY IN YOUR MARKETING EFFORTS. Did I just write in caps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reduce:&lt;/span&gt; Not only should B2B companies reduce the amount of &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingevolved.blogspot.com/2008/03/5-tips-to-marketing-in-down-economy.html"&gt;lead leakage&lt;/a&gt; where leads are being lost is the sales/marketing funnel by tightening up processes, the following also needs the be considered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reduce the amount of communication that you're sending to leads&lt;/span&gt;. Are you saying to yourself "Are you on drugs Chad? Why would I want to send less communications when I need to keep up the number of leads to my sales team?". In a down economy you need to work on further segmenting your campaigns and matching your communications to the right person at the right time. Any emails, direct mail etc... send should be based on a person's interest and the stage of the demand waterfall that they are in. This type of eco-marketing will &lt;a href="http://www.returnpath.net/blog/2007/08/elongated-sales-cycles-require.php"&gt;achieve the best results&lt;/a&gt; and ensure that you conserve (another eco-friendly term!) you're ever shrinking opt-in database in the tough times ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reduce the amount of time it takes for qualified leads to be followed up with&lt;/span&gt;. An automated lead nurturing process will help deal with leads that are qualified but not yet ready to buy and thus reducing leads falling through the cracks but a process needs to be put in place to put the best leads on the desks of your sales team so they'll follow up right away. The best solution for this is a lead scoring process that scores leads based on their explicit information (industry, job role etc...) and their implicit activity (offers they've downloaded, emails they've responded to). With this type of process in place, you can ensure that your sales team is "cutting through the crap" and following up with the best leads before your competitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reduce the complexity to getting access to information on your website&lt;/span&gt;. Optimize your landing pages by removing any unnecessary fields. Ask for more information only if it makes sense to the potential lead. Consider building up a profile of the lead over time. This requires more effort as you need to think through the stages on getting this information but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Recycle:&lt;/span&gt; By recycling leads that are in your sales and marketing funnel you will get the most out of your marketing investments. Just because a potential lead attends a webinar and doesn't respond to a sales call doesn't mean they're not interested in buying from your company. An eco-marketer may want to further investigate SiriusDecisions methodologies around calling webinar attendees "inquiries" rather then leads and not passing these on to sales until they've been further qualified through an automated marketing program. In fact, SiriusDecisions has demonstrated that &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/07/prweb406501.htm"&gt;webinars are typically viewed at the beginning stages of the buying process&lt;/a&gt;. This is just one example of how marketers need to go beyond lead generation to concentrate on the lead funnel and developing strategies to move leads through this funnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Recycle your "inactive leads"&lt;/span&gt;.  Recycling doesn't just include those leads that are not "sales ready" or not yet ready to buy. You need to have automated processes that will detect those leads that you've been sending emails to (or other forms of communication like direct mail) and haven't responded. This means that they haven't visited your website, filled out a form or responded to your marketing communications. You can recycle these leads by placing them in a separate automated program with messages that are specific to this segment. This may include an email with a survey asking these "inactives" what they would like to receive from your company or a request to opt back in with a targeted offer. You may decide that it's time to take some of these leads to the curb but at least you have tried your hardest to maximize those leads that came through your front door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A bonus R is "Remove"&lt;/span&gt;. Remove any of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Remove barriers between the sales and marketing team&lt;/span&gt;. Everyone needs to work together. Think peace and joy on earth (just like a real environmentalist).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Remove campaigns or tactics that are not working&lt;/span&gt;. To do this, you need a mechanism in place to measure every aspect of your marketing efforts. This goes back to my original premise of researching the demand waterfall. Having a defined process in place where you can measure the success of your marketing efforts at each stage of the sales marketing funnel is crucial. For example, if the conversion rate of a Google AdWords campaign is failing as the effort to turn these "inquiries" into MQLs (marketing qualified leads) is too expensive and takes too long, remove it. Focus on sources that are bringing in more qualified leads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Remove crappy data and automate the process if possible&lt;/span&gt;. You will probably have fewer leads coming in the top of your pipeline so you can concentrate on creating processes that will remove contacts that should never hit your database. This may include contacts with bad email addresses, your competitors etc... You can also look at your database for data that is inconsistent and clean it up. Where possible, you can fix this data using automated data tools. For example, it may be possible to standardize contacts that have various job titles or contacts that have different versions of a country (USA, U.S.A., United States etc...). Bad data prevents you from further segmenting your database. Clean out the crap and ensure it stays as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Remove or punish people that have not bought in&lt;/span&gt;. Relating this back to the environment,&lt;a href="http://www.toronto.ca/target70/qa.htm"&gt; in Toronto we've implemented a new program for home owners that taxes you based on the garbage that you put at the curb&lt;/a&gt;. If you follow the three R's and reduce your trash, you save money. If you don't want to get with the program, you'll pay for it with your wallet. It's fairly straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an eco-marketer, you need to get the senior people bought in on your new eco-marketing mantra. If you have sales people that don't want to participate, have them penalized. If you have marketing folks that can't see the forest through the trees, remove them. It's obviously easier said then done but that's why you need executive buy-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;I'm sure you can add here to my points above and I implore you to do that by leaving some comments. Good luck to you during some tough times ahead and be the best eco-marketer you can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Here are some additional resources I used in my research (let me know if you have other useful resources)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071008/FREE/71008036/1152/ISSUETOOLS"&gt;Lead recycling means nothing wasted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6416089/Funnelnomics-ebook"&gt;Funnelnomics: Accelerate your marketing and sales funnel to drive growth and profitability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6416354/eBook-Vol4-Marketing-and-Sales-Alignment"&gt;B2B Lead: 10 tips for marketing and sales alignment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;PPS - Here are some &lt;a href="http://www.thunderbay.ca/index.cfm?fuse=html&amp;amp;pg=673"&gt;tips to reduce the amount of water you use in your home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/eco-marketer," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;eco-marketer,&lt;/a&gt;

Incidentally I did predict Obama winning the election and also the Dolphins beating the Seahawks today so I'm on a roll!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I found a new site that you can use to compare how you're company is doing on the blogosphere versus your competition.

I checked out a site called &lt;a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/"&gt;Tweetvolume&lt;/a&gt; that tracks the number of times a term(s) is mentioned on Twitter and presents it in a bar chart. You can compare multiple items which allows you to compare the mentions of your company vs. another company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a few I tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=coke,pepsi"&gt;Coke vs. Pepsi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=pc,mac"&gt;PC vs. Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=wii,xbox,playstation"&gt;Wii vs. Xbox vs. Playstation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=Palin,Bidden"&gt;Palin vs. Bidden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=McCain,Obama"&gt;McCain vs. Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Try it out and you can even send a link to your boss showing how your company compares to your competitor.

I'm always looking to help out marketers with their landing pages ever since I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/"&gt;Marketing Experiments Landing Page Workshop&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year (yes, it was in Florida and no, I didn't just go to the beach!). From time to time, I check out &lt;a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/ea/index.asp"&gt;MarketingProf's Know How Exchange&lt;/a&gt; where people post their marketing questions and I try and help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following was posted on &lt;a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/ea/qst_question.asp?qstID=25953"&gt;MarketingProfs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table width="85%" align="center" cellpadding="1"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 153);font-family:Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:100%;"  &gt;Landing Page Critique For Agency's Ppc Campaign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img alt="Premium Member" src="http://www.blogger.com/images/premium/premium_ind_small.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted By:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile.asp?userID=793286"&gt;melissa&lt;/a&gt; on  10/10/2008 5:23 PM (CST)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;b&gt;125&lt;/b&gt; Points&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"&gt; &lt;td class="content" colspan="2"&gt;Hello,&lt;br /&gt;We are running a PPC campaign for a  full-service marketing agency, and trying to decide on the best landing page for  the promotion. The conversion goal is for prospective clients to call or  complete the short contact form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pay-per-click categories/keywords  are for: marketing agency, advertising, copywriting, design, branding, etc. Lead  results so far have been pretty good, but conversions are terrible (we have not  used any of these landing page designs yet). It's possible that we are not  attracting the right audience, however it may be another reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have  developed 3 different variations for the landing page - please review these  links (refer to each as 1, 2, or 3) and let me know what you think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 -- &lt;a class="resplink" href="http://www.discoverycomm.com/landingSample/DCG1.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.discoverycomm.com/landingSample/DCG1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2  -- &lt;a class="resplink" href="http://www.discoverycomm.com/landingSample/DCG2.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.discoverycomm.com/landingSample/DCG2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3  -- &lt;a class="resplink" href="http://www.discoverycomm.com/landingSample/DCG3.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.discoverycomm.com/landingSample/DCG3.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my response (I admit I'm not modest and don't pull any punches). The picture above is the first example that is provided:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface this as I've been certified by Marketing Experiments in landing  page creation. Out of the three, I liked the design of the first landing page  but truthfully, I don't see your conversion rates increasing. Here's  why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. What is compelling the web visitor to respond? What's in it for  me? All I hear about is your company. I don't feel you've touched on any pain  points of my company. This page seems way too broad. Create a title that is  compelling and really hits on the keyword that someone typed in that led to them  landing on this page.&lt;br /&gt;b. The offer is the same old same old. Above someone  mentions a case study. You'll have readers that do not want someone calling them  right away. I would recommend starting the "conversation" with a simple download  that hits on a pain point of the marketer as the call to action and not the  "free discussion". Send them a follow up email with another call to action and  see if they are interested. This will definitely increase your  conversions.&lt;br /&gt;c. This is petty but the letter looks like a 5 year old designed  it. I'm not talking about the copy but rather the design. The letters are all  sloped. This can be improved. (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Actually, as I read this again, the copy is really &lt;/span&gt;hokey)&lt;br /&gt;d. This is also petty but there is no submit  button on the form!! You need something compelling such as "I want my free  consultation" or "Have George call me".&lt;br /&gt;e. Add a privacy agreement. This  reduces the anxiety of the web visitor.&lt;br /&gt;f. It's a best practice to remove the  site navigation so keep the page as is. I disagree with a few of the folks  above. Don't confuse the web visitor with additional information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good  luck!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;I hope you found this helpful and feel free to send your landing pages my way and I'll try and review them (also feel free to go to the MarketingProfs forum and criticize my feedback or post a comment right here!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: &lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/FREE/810029985/1085/FREE"&gt;This case study&lt;/a&gt; on B2B online backs up my recommendations above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="techtags"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Landing" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Landing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/page" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/optimization," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;optimization,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/improving" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;improving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/conversion" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;conversion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rates," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;rates,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/PPC" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;PPC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/campaigns,copy" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;campaigns,copy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/writing" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/that" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hits" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/a" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pain" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/point," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;point,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/call" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/to" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/actions" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/work," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;work,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Happy" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Happy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Thanksgiving" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Eh" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Eh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/78663200583335305/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=78663200583335305' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/78663200583335305?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/78663200583335305'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/10/landing-page-optimization-mini-case.html' title='Landing Page Optimization: Mini Case Study'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SPPg2OroTTI/AAAAAAAAAIs/2VsYzMBMyWY/s72-c/Landing-Page-4.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-7978875653997352678</id><published>2008-09-28T16:58:00.008-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-28T17:44:45.915-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-28T17:44:45.915-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='online marketing'/><title type='text'>Improved Email Click-Through Tracking Using Query Strings</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SOAD0YbaLhI/AAAAAAAAAII/xo85S8cR3Tw/s1600-h/clickthrough.png"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5251201363959492114" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; CURSOR: pointer" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SOAD0YbaLhI/AAAAAAAAAII/xo85S8cR3Tw/s200/clickthrough.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you have a call to action that is directed at the same landing page more then one time in your email, what is the best way to track which link received the most unique clicks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's back up and review why this topic is important for marketers. As a best practice, it's VERY important to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have more then one link in your email to the desired landing page. For example, one link may be an image while one is a text link&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know which links in your email are performing better. You can use this information for future campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Jay Kulkarni over at B2B wrote an article on this subject called:"&lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/FREE/234641877/1084/FREE"&gt;How can you ensure that you’re effectively tracking unique click rates on the same URLs within your e-mail creative?&lt;/a&gt;" Jay suggests using web redirects on subsequent versions of the link. For example, say you have a link to an event such as this &lt;a href="https://h30406.www3.hp.com/campaigns/2008/events/poweritdown/index.php"&gt;HP event&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the original URL:&lt;br /&gt;https://h30406.www3.hp.com/campaigns/2008/events/poweritdown/index.php&lt;br /&gt;You could then create a redirect such as:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.hp.com/poweritdown/index.php that will redirect the web visitor to the original URL but will allow you to track that an email recipient clicked on the second URL and not the first URL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Track Multiple Email Click-Throughs To The Same Landing Page Using Query Strings&lt;/h4&gt;There is another way of tracking mutiple click-throughs from different links in an email that go to the same page. This process I'm going to suggest may be easier for you as well - no need for setting up a redirect. I typically recommend using query strings to get this type of tracking. All you need to do is add a query string and a query string value to the URL and you can track multiple instances of a URL that go to the same page. For example, let's take the original URL example I used above. To make this a unique URL, I can add a query string called "link" with a value of "2" (I used 2 as this is the second instance of the URL). Here is what it looks like: https://h30406.www3.hp.com/campaigns/2008/events/poweritdown/index.php&lt;span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0)"&gt;?link=2&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks easy eh (My Canadian accent coming through)? Well it is. This doesn't require any technical know how and any good tracking system should differentiate URLs based on query string values. Try this out and let me know how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I talk more about query strings and how they can be used for improved tracking in my post called &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/10/one-way-to-tackle-closed-loop-marketing.html"&gt;One way to tackle closed loop marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;PPS: Follow me on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chadhorenfeldt"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/tracking" rel="tag"&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/multiple" rel="tag"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/call" rel="tag"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/to" rel="tag"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/actions," rel="tag"&gt;actions,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" rel="tag"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/click-throughs," rel="tag"&gt;click-throughs,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Improved" rel="tag"&gt;Improved&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/results," rel="tag"&gt;results,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/query" rel="tag"&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/strings" rel="tag"&gt;strings&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/7978875653997352678/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=7978875653997352678' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/7978875653997352678?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7978875653997352678'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/09/improved-email-click-through-tracking.html' title='Improved Email Click-Through Tracking Using Query Strings'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SOAD0YbaLhI/AAAAAAAAAII/xo85S8cR3Tw/s72-c/clickthrough.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-7672695948110431172</id><published>2008-09-20T11:27:00.007-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-20T12:22:01.267-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-20T12:22:01.267-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lead nurturing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2B'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing automation'/><title type='text'>Lead Nurturing - How to track ROI?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SNUuNYzEyII/AAAAAAAAAIA/yzYJivpeg_k/s1600-h/lead_nurturing.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SNUuNYzEyII/AAAAAAAAAIA/yzYJivpeg_k/s320/lead_nurturing.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5248151748300032130" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The concept of lead nurturing is something that is complex for some but very straightforward for others. To keep it simple, I look at it as a way of keeping your company top of mind to your potential customers or existing customers who are qualified but not yet ready to buy. I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here so check out Brian Carroll's &lt;a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2004/04/a_recent_study_.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; for a more in depth explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Quick Overview on Trends in Lead Nurturing&lt;/h4&gt;Lead nurturing can present itself in many ways. It can consist of a sales or call center rep calling a prospect over a period of time or a series of emails sent by marketing. The shift that I've seen is to automate the process using technology. This makes it easier for marketing as messages can be delivered in a timely and consistent manner without a marketing person manually sending out the email each time. Sales benefits as well as marketing is performing "air cover" and with today's tools, the messages can look like the sales rep is sending it themselves with all of this being automated. The other shift I've seen is to use multiple channels as part of a well laid out plan. This may consist of a postcard sent out with an email being sent two days later so it coincides with the direct mail piece and then having a call center rep call 2 days later to maximize the impact of the campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Great - How do I track ROI for Lead Nurturing?&lt;/h4&gt;If you are using a CRM with a campaign component, set up a campaign that is specific to your lead nurturing efforts (you may need several campaigns based on the number of programs you are running). On any of the emails that you send as part of the campaign, direct the respondents to a form landing page that when filled out, passes the lead to your CRM and tags that respondent as being part of the lead nurturing campaign that you set up. As deals turn into opportunities and then hopefully into closed deals, you can look back on how your lead nurturing program contributed to the pipeline and then eventually to your company's bottom line. I've also seen companies use a dedicated 1-800 number as part of their lead nurturing campaigns which allows them to easily indicate that the call was generated from a lead nurturing channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The explanation above is a summarized view on tracking ROI and some marketers out there may probably rolling their eyes and saying "if only it were that simple". There are many factors that go into this including getting sales and marketing working together as well as buy-in from the marketing team and the rest of the company to invest the time and resources in a systemized lead nurturing process. All I can say is that from what I've seen, it's well worth it and with a well throughout process the return on investment should not take too long to be realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lead Nurturing - Getting Started&lt;/h4&gt;Starting a lead nurturing initiative is not the focus of this article but what I would recommend for now is to start simple and look for an area that you can run a pilot program. For example, pick a specific segment such as a key vertical and choose leads generated from a specific channel such as Google Adwords. A simple program may consist of 2-3 emails sent within a specific time period with key messages that should educate prospects and make it easy for them to reach out to your company. Obviously, the more automated you can make this, the easier it gets for the marketing team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it for now - hopefully this was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/online" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/lead" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/generation," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;generation,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/sales" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;sales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/air" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cover," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;cover,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/nurturing," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;nurturing,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/automated" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/marketing" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ROI" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;ROI&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/7672695948110431172/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=7672695948110431172' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/7672695948110431172?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7672695948110431172'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/09/lead-nurturing-how-to-track-roi.html' title='Lead Nurturing - How to track ROI?'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SNUuNYzEyII/AAAAAAAAAIA/yzYJivpeg_k/s72-c/lead_nurturing.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-4889521330058754901</id><published>2008-09-09T00:58:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-14T13:01:52.048-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-14T13:01:52.048-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lead nurturing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2B'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='enewsletter'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2C'/><title type='text'>Newsletter Content that Engages Your Marketing Database</title><content type='html'>Take a minute out of your day and have a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/c7XSp2Y107w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;look at this ad&lt;/a&gt; (it's worth it):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/c7XSp2Y107w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/c7XSp2Y107w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is an ad but what is appealing is the message. This is not about beer. This is not enticing you to go out and drink beer. It's providing a message that hits you on an emotional level and when they have you right where they want you (at the "Thank You"), they flash their logo up there. This beer company is going beyond their product to focus on their target audience. I can imagine the thought process of the agency in their board room: "What content can we produce that will engage Anheuser Bush's customers?" They succeeded with this ad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Who are you Writing Your Newsletters for?&lt;/h4&gt;For many companies, newsletters are key to either keeping customers, creating repeat customers or nurturing prospects who are interested in your products but not yet ready to buy. Many company newsletters you receive in your inbox today talk about how their company is changing and what new products are being released. So what? Why do I care about that? How is that going to help me finish my work for the day? Why would I want to open your newsletter? Before you click the send button on your next email blast, you need to consider these questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Creating Relevant Newsletter Content 2.0&lt;/h4&gt;Creating relevant content does not just mean writing about an aspect of your product or service that appeals to the target audience. Of course you need these but it's the companies that go beyond this that are able to create, nurture and sustain a loyal audience that will keep your company top of mind. Consider writing about content that will entertain or enrich the daily lives of your email registrants. This goes beyond your product and beyond your company. Here are some examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Solar Ink (by Solar Winds)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/newsletters/July_08.html"&gt;Check out this newsletter issue&lt;/a&gt; where they feature the "Game show for geeks". This B2B company is clearly in tune with its target audience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;MEC Email Newsletter (by Mountain Equipment Co-op)&lt;/span&gt;. Here is an &lt;a href="http://www.mec.ca/Main/fyi.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674135554&amp;amp;bmUID=1221412880138"&gt;example of their newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that contains how to videos on how to fix your bike. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Smart Life (by TD Bank Financial Group)&lt;/span&gt;. Here is &lt;a href="http://www.ariad.ca/about/case_study.html"&gt;a case study&lt;/a&gt; that outlines how this newsletter that is targeted at its customers is designed to keep TD top of mind so they renew. It doesn't just feature their products and promotions but includes "lifestyle topics about home and family, car care, vacation                  properties and vehicles, smart saving and spending ideas".   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Based on these examples, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;here is the bottom line to consider&lt;/span&gt;: How can you provide content to your prospects and customers that goes beyond your products and services but focuses on what is interesting to them and will keep them interested so either they keep buying from you or will eventually buy from you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: On a side note, it would be interesting to further investigate how these companies segment their databases and if they serve different content based on these segments. For example, does content differentiate based on past products purchased, geography, job title?&lt;br /&gt;PPS: I receive these newsletters above and read them.&lt;br /&gt;PPPS: This concept can go beyond newsletters and be used for your automated lead nurturing efforts or in an attempt to re-engage email subscribers that are unresponsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/newsletters," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;newsletters,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/e-newsletters," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;e-newsletters,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/newsletter" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/content," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;content,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/segmentation," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;segmentation,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/relevancy," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;relevancy,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/online" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/marketting," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;marketting,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/targeted" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;targeted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/message," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;message,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/beer" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ad," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;ad,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Support" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Our" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Our&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Troops," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Troops,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/examples," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;examples,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Umm..." rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Umm...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Beer" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Beer&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/4889521330058754901/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=4889521330058754901' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/4889521330058754901?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4889521330058754901'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/09/newsletter-content-that-engages-your.html' title='Newsletter Content that Engages Your Marketing Database'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-7384305409423569310</id><published>2008-06-22T22:52:00.008-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-23T00:23:02.462-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-06-23T00:23:02.462-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='landing pages'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2B'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lead conversion'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2C'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='online marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Marketing Sherpa'/><title type='text'>The Right Way to Generate More Leads on Your Site</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SF8q-rM6yMI/AAAAAAAAAHw/N5a3JzTchfo/s1600-h/Whats_In_It_For_Me_marketing.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214934149755488450" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SF8q-rM6yMI/AAAAAAAAAHw/N5a3JzTchfo/s320/Whats_In_It_For_Me_marketing.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's been a very busy month with lots of travel thrown in. Throughout my journeys much of the conversation comes back to generating a higher quantity of leads from the web that are of better quality. I had the pleasure of attending the Marketing Experiments Website Optimization workshop that was held in Florida earlier this month (still waiting for my landing page professional certification badge :) ). From that conference, combined with a very good study on &lt;a href="http://www.silverpop.com/downloads/documents/SilverpopStudy_TopRetailerEmailTactics.pdf"&gt;email tactics in retail&lt;/a&gt; I've been inspired to write a post on this topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What's in it for me?&lt;/h4&gt;They key point hammered home at the Marketing Experiments Workshop is that all points of interaction on your website should answer the following question from the web visitor's perspective: "What's in it for me?". Therefore, if you have one of those newsletter sign up boxes on every page of your site (like the one I have in the top right hand corner) that says "Enter your email to get our newsletter", you may need to rethink this area as you're not providing a compelling reason for the visitor to sign up for your newsletter. A better approach may be "Get expert updates on X" (by X I mean a specific topic that is assumed to be relevant to the site's content or why would they be there in the first place). Even the submit button should be written in a way that answers the question "What's in it for me". For example: "Send me Product Alerts".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;To use a simple sign up form or to not use a simple sign up form - that is the question.&lt;/h4&gt;To go back to my last point on that newsletter sign up - should this be a simple email only form or should you have a link that directs web visitors to a newsletter sign up page? This depends on your target audience as well as the type of segmentation and personalization you would like to perform in your marketing campaigns. B2C companies may only need email to begin the conversation but B2B companies typically collect company name and first and last name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the points to remember:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Most of the pages on your site can be accessed from a search engine&lt;/span&gt;. Don't assume that web visitors come waltzing through the front door (your home page). A website is like a big semi-permeable blob (think back to your to your biology days) that can be entered from all areas. Therefore ensure that you have a call to action on every page to engage new visitors and turn them into leads that you can market to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ensure you answer the question "What's in it for me" &lt;/span&gt;and don't assume that because they are on a website about say hot dogs that the visitor will know that the newsletter will provide the latest deals on hot dogs. Don't assume anything. You need to spell it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bad tactic that I see is to use landing pages for multiple purposes. For example, directing newsletter registrations to the Contact Us page. This is not a good idea as the call to action doesn't correspond to the desired result and possible subscribers would be scared off as they don't want Mr/Mrs Salesperson calling on them asking them how many hot dogs they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The more fields on your web form, the less conversions&lt;/span&gt;. For some marketers, this is OK as they only want serious submissions. For example, if you're inquiring about how you can fly into space through one of those private space programs, you first need some serious coin to be considered. It would be a good idea to ask subscribers for their annual income before having someone in sales call them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are just trying to start a conversation to attract a larger audience to a subject area that you have expert content in, the less fields on your form that you do have, the higher the conversion rate. Always ask yourself if you really need those additional form fields (say for segmenting or personalization) and can you get that information in a future campaign or do you need this information right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another consideration is to ask subscribers what type of information they would like to receive. This is definitely recommended. It should also be clear how often you will be sending subscribers communications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Test, test, test...&lt;/span&gt; I know you hear that all the time. Imagine being stuck in a conference room for 8 hours straight each day in Florida right beside a PGA golf course and being forced to hear that when you could be outside. Of course the Marketing Experiment people are right. You need to test out the method that will work the best for your situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;I hope that this post has been helpful and I should be adding some additional findings from my landing page workshop experience. In the meantime, feel free to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chadhorenfeldt"&gt;check out my twitter profile for updates on marketing tools and info that I pick up&lt;/a&gt;. I just found an interesting tool that can tell you the type of email client that your subscribers are using to view your email in. This can be key in better understanding how best to design your emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I just changed my blog updates sign up form text - we'll see if it improves conversions. I think I need to provide content more often. :)&lt;br /&gt;PPS - image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.wearyourbeer.com"&gt;www.wearyourbeer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/beer," rel="tag"&gt;beer,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/landing" rel="tag"&gt;landing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/page" rel="tag"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/optimization," rel="tag"&gt;optimization,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Marketing" rel="tag"&gt;Marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Experiments," rel="tag"&gt;Experiments,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Call" rel="tag"&gt;Call&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/to" rel="tag"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Action," rel="tag"&gt;Action,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/What%27s" rel="tag"&gt;What's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/In" rel="tag"&gt;In&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/it" rel="tag"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/for" rel="tag"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Me," rel="tag"&gt;Me,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/test," rel="tag"&gt;test,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/PGA," rel="tag"&gt;PGA,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Tiger" rel="tag"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Woods," rel="tag"&gt;Woods,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Space" rel="tag"&gt;Space&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/-" rel="tag"&gt;-&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/the" rel="tag"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/final" rel="tag"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="techtag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/frontier" rel="tag"&gt;frontier&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/7384305409423569310/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=7384305409423569310' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/7384305409423569310?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7384305409423569310'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/06/right-way-to-generate-more-leads-on.html' title='The Right Way to Generate More Leads on Your Site'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/SF8q-rM6yMI/AAAAAAAAAHw/N5a3JzTchfo/s72-c/Whats_In_It_For_Me_marketing.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-4104569214729295146</id><published>2008-05-17T12:57:00.008-05:00</published><updated>2008-05-17T13:25:13.126-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-05-17T13:25:13.126-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing automation'/><title type='text'>Improve Email Conversions.

This concept is an obvious one but the article does provide some good strategies on how to improve email response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it doesn't discuss is how to make the process of sending a second email to those that don't open or click on the first email you sent an easy one. Instead of just blasting the entire list again including those that didn't respond, marketers should be segmenting their lists and only sending the email to those that either didn't respond (open or click-through) and/or those that didn't convert (fill out a form). Again, that's obvious but this can take time to do. How can you cut down the time it takes to send out the second email?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Making Re-Mailing Easy: Improve Conversions, Get Home to See Your Family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;The tricky part is making the process of sending that second email an easy one. You don't have time to do extra work and you shouldn't have to. You want to get your job done and go home and watch the final of American Idol or the Office - so do I. Through an automated process using advanced automation tools, you can easily create a program that checks to see if a contact on your initial list has converted and/or responded to the email. If they haven't, have the program send the second email automatically by a preset date.  Once you have your marketing assets ready, load your list into the top of your automated program, sit back, and measure the results. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;, we all know you're not going to sit back but you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;Bronto&lt;/span&gt; for reminding me that everyone uses this process but not everyone has optimized how to carry this process out to do it as quickly as possible. I'm going to create an automated program template that will make this easy for my customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/4104569214729295146/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=4104569214729295146' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/4104569214729295146?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4104569214729295146'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/05/improve-email-conversions-save-time.html' title='Improve Email Conversions.

Keeping your data clean is a top priority for the marketers I speak with. I was just reading a good article on Marketing Sherpa that outlines "&lt;a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.php?ident=30564"&gt;4 Ways to Fix Misspelled Email Addresses&lt;/a&gt;". I really liked one of the ideas which involves displaying the email address to the web visitor as part of a second step in the registration process. A simple modification to this is to serve up a confirmation page after the registration that includes the email address that the person just entered in large letters. The content would be something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;Here is the email address you entered:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);font-size:180%;" &gt;aquachad@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;Is that correct? If it isn't, please &lt;/span&gt;&lt;u style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;update your profile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt; (link to a profile page)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fairly easy to implement as a solution depending on your system and is something I'm going to recommend for clients to at least test out on a few landing pages. If visitors click on that update your profile link and update their email address, you'll know you're on to something. You can also sleep better at night knowing that the you're getting more out of your marketing campaigns as the data that enters in your system is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/3726008000068197682/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=3726008000068197682' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/3726008000068197682?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3726008000068197682'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/05/preventing-incorrect-email-addresses.html' title='Preventing incorrect email addresses'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-2905967383419061512</id><published>2008-04-09T18:47:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-09T18:50:15.674-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-04-09T18:50:15.674-05:00</app:edited><title type='text'>In memory of my father in law</title><content type='html'>Below is a video that I captured of my nieces, my sister in law and my recently deceased father in law.

Perhaps but you should really consider what you send and how you send it because email recipients these days no longer have the same patience as they once had. They expect to receive relevant and timely information that they have subscribed to. Before you know it, you'll have a bunch of unsubscribes and when you really do have relevant information, you'll miss out some key prospects/customers as they've already opt-ed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion would be to include press release snippets as part of a monthly or quarterly newsletter that has additional value added content. In this way, you cut down on the frequency of your emails and you provide content in a more regular format that your email subscribers expect to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Here is a great article from Demand Gen Report that speaks to some of the points above in terms of using and not abusing your email list: &lt;a href="http://www.demandgenreport.com/demandviews.php?codearti=1111"&gt;&lt;span class="title redcolor"&gt;Building &amp;amp; Leveraging A New Email List From The  Ground Up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/5217699001415585593/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=5217699001415585593' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/5217699001415585593?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5217699001415585593'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/03/should-you-still-email-your-press.html' title='Should You Still Email Your Press Releases?'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-6159513780271145310</id><published>2008-03-16T19:06:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-16T19:17:15.114-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-03-16T19:17:15.114-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='e-marketing'/><title type='text'>Email Branding Tip to Increase Open Rates</title><content type='html'>This is a quick post on a great tip from Stefan Pollard in hist post: &lt;a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3628704"&gt;Use Brand-Recognition Elements to Combat Inbox Triage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stefan recommends putting your company name in the "view online" link at the top of your email.

For those companies that have an ESP (Email Service Provider) where you can specify this, you'll know what I mean (or you can read his article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/6159513780271145310/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=6159513780271145310' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/6159513780271145310?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/6159513780271145310'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/03/email-branding-tip-to-increase-open.html' title='Email Branding Tip to Increase Open Rates'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-1051794267659346072</id><published>2008-03-09T19:43:00.007-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-09T21:04:28.114-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-03-09T21:04:28.114-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='enewsletter'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='e-marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='webinars / webcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='blogging'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Web 2.0.'/><title type='text'>Latest Trends in Email Marketing: RSS and Calendar Reminders</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R9SVO7uo9qI/AAAAAAAAAHY/cM-R7gOGnwQ/s1600-h/rss_injection.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R9SVO7uo9qI/AAAAAAAAAHY/cM-R7gOGnwQ/s320/rss_injection.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175925955539564194" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As we move into a new week there are some interesting trends and technology enhancements that will start to change the way that B2B companies use email. For those that are thinking "email is email - how can it change?", keep reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Trend#1: The Blogletter is Coming - Actually, it's Already Here.&lt;/h4&gt;You may recall I blogged about a concept called the &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-invented-word-blogletter.html"&gt;Blogletter&lt;/a&gt; (combo of email newsletter and blog posts). I don't hold anything against the blog readers out there who unsubscribed from my feed en mass after that post (OK, well a few of you I do). Here's the truth - the blogletter will be arriving very soon and will revolutionize the way some companies can create and execute an email newsletter or any email campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept behind a blogletter is to be able to publish blog posts (or any RSS feeds for that matter) directly to an email and send it to subscribers. One of my &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-improve-your-email-newsletter.html#c3979098308376279931"&gt;readers back then&lt;/a&gt; asked me how this concept would work. At the time I didn't have any answers except for &lt;a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/newsletter/"&gt;Feedblitz&lt;/a&gt;'s tool which allows web visitors to get updated via email every time you submit a blog post (they have some new paid tools as well). This approach works for the average blogger but companies need better tools. The tools are now here and here are two approaches that you can use to take advantage of this technology:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Integrating RSS feeds and emails&lt;/span&gt;. Imagine if you could integrate an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; (if you don't know what RSS is and you are in marketing, you may want to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed"&gt;read the following&lt;/a&gt;) with an email. For those of you who have feeds already (which include blogs) this would mean that you don't have to update content in multiple areas. You can update an RSS feed and have it publish to your website and email. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Automating email using RSS feeds&lt;/span&gt;. Let's take this a step further with automation. If you regularly post content to your RSS feeds, you could potentially create an automated program that would send an email  newsletter (Blogletter or RSSletter) automatically on the date that you defined. The newsletter would consist of the latest articles/posts from your RSS feeds as well as any other elements of your newsletter. What's key here is that the whole process to create a newsletter becomes much easier as you have an automated program that sends the email for you and the content is content that you've created for a blog or other RSS feed. This process works very well for new subscribers to your site as they can get a newsletter with the latest articles from the RSS feeds that you have defined. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Other advantages? As I mentioned in my &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-improve-your-email-newsletter.html"&gt;previous article on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, your readers can comment on articles which adds a new dimension to email as it's no longer a one way push marketing channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this interesting as the technology now exists to do this. The above examples are the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Trend #2: Helping Your Customers/Prospects Organize Themselves&lt;/h4&gt;This tip/technology isn't new but it's now easier and thus has many more implications. A while back I wrote about &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/05/increase-attendence-for-webinars-and.html"&gt;how you can improve webinar/webcast attendee rates&lt;/a&gt; by creating a file that when clicked on, can book off the time specified in your email recipient's Outlook (and other programs too) calendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process was a bit of a pain as you need to create the .ics file and then upload it to your server. It's much easier now as some systems will allow you to create this on the fly and integrate directly into your email or website. What does this mean? Here are some ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Set real milestones&lt;/span&gt;: There are many "How to" white papers out there that pose a  problem that that you may be experiencing and provide a solution with next steps. For example, a white paper that outlines a ten step plan to turn around their business using your product or service. Imagine if you could create a solution with key milestones including REAL dates that the your prospect/customer can save on their own Outlook/Lotus calender. In addition, this information (email clicks) can be tracked. By tracking this information, you can have your inside sales/demand gen team follow up with these prospects on the actual date of the milestone that was outlined and ensure that they are on the path that was outlined which may include a meeting with someone from your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Read later reminder&lt;/span&gt;: Do you hate an inbox full of email? I know I do. I can't hit the delete button faster in many cases (still waiting for that voice activated delete email function). What if you created a standard feature for all of your emails that was a simple link that said "I want to read this at a later date". By clicking on the link, the user would be presented with a calender item that had an online link to the newsletter and a recommended calender reminder to read the email at a later date as well as a suggested time/day. This approach may book off 10 minutes of a person's actual day to read your email. The email recipient can adjust the date to suite her/his schedule. The mobile folk may also like this feature as they can set a reminder to read the email when they are back in the office. Will this work? maybe. Is it worth trying? Definitely as it's very easy to do with some of the new enhancements out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Email is going well beyond the traditional approach where it was used to just push out information. The interactivity described above is part of a trend in B2B marketing which is focusing more on the ongoing conversation with prospects and customers rather then a one-off &lt;a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/brand_speak.asp?bs_id=183"&gt;batch and blast&lt;/a&gt; approach. The ideas described above may seem a bit off the wall but should be considered along with other ideas on how to make email more interactive and to integrate it with overall marketing processes rather then as a tool in itself. I hope I have at least made you start to think about new approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Thanks for the &lt;a href="http://www.justsayhi.com/"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; Just Say Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blogletter," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;blogletter,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blog" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/newsletter," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;newsletter,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/calendar" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/reminders" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;reminders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/for" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/events," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;events,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/deleting" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;deleting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/1051794267659346072/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=1051794267659346072' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/1051794267659346072?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1051794267659346072'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/03/latest-trends-in-email-marketing-rss.html' title='Latest Trends in Email Marketing: RSS and Calendar Reminders'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R9SVO7uo9qI/AAAAAAAAAHY/cM-R7gOGnwQ/s72-c/rss_injection.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-1799067510550911369</id><published>2008-02-24T18:03:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-27T01:28:02.990-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-02-27T01:28:02.990-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2B'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lead generation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='B2C'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='viral marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Marketing Sherpa'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='youtube'/><title type='text'>Are Webisodes Just for B2C? Who Hired Bob?</title><content type='html'>Kraft has an interesting new microsite that follows the life of Bob at his workplace and his quest to replace the existing coffee machine with a Kraft Tassimo. Bob is one of those crazy co-workers that has a few screws loose. In fact, you could probably open a Home Depot with the trail of hardware he leaves. However, as someone that has seen like 20 different coffee machines at work over a span of three years that all produce putrid coffee that makes me run to the local Tim Horton's (Dunkin Donuts for the Southern Folk and I go for Starbucks when I'm working around the clock and need something superhuman to keep my eyes open - what is in the bold coffee? Probably something that Nasa found on mars), I can sympathize with Bob. You can check it out at &lt;a href="http://whohiredbob.com/"&gt;www.whohiredbob.com&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a clip I found on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bPZ-khkoys"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8bPZ-khkoys&amp;amp;rel=1"&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8bPZ-khkoys&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think the webisodes are funny and entertaining, will it bring Kraft the desired effect of getting businesses to use Tassimos in the workplace rather then just at home? Possibly. I watched  the first video and I got bored fairly quickly. There was little mention of Tassimo and what it can do until well into the video. What I did like was the  contest that was encouraging web visitors to  submit stories about their own Bobs to win a prize. We'll see if this site brings about the desired objectives but I think it's a step in the right direction on how to use video and user generated content (of course the fact that I'm blogging about this probably helps. You can thank me later Kraft).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Using Paid Search to Enhance the Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;I would use a tool like &lt;a href="http://www.wordtracker.com/"&gt;WordTracker&lt;/a&gt; to see which terms are searched on the most in search engines like Google and Microsoft but Tassimo may want to consider creating sponsored ads on Google for Keywords (have you checked out &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.google.com/trends"&gt;www.google.com/trends&lt;/a&gt;? it rocks!). I checked out &lt;a href="http://www.spyfu.com/"&gt;SpyFu&lt;/a&gt; which tells you which keywords your competitors are bidding on. They don't seem to have any Google AdWords that are specific to this campaign. Here are some examples of keywords for Kraft to consider if they go this route:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tassimo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crazy co-workers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee in the workplace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad coffee at work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who hired bob&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't you hate when someone drinks the last cup of coffee at work and doesn't make another pot? Don't you want to find that person and hunt them down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Ok, that last one may be a bit extreme but it may also be part of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail"&gt;long tail&lt;/a&gt; of search. Some additional ideas may include advertising on The Office's (TV show) &lt;a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Webisodes and B2B Companies&lt;/h4&gt;The budget for this Tassimo campaign is probably out of the reach for most companies and is most likely only doable on the B2C side. However, B2B companies are creating entertaining videos to draw attention to their product and services. Here are a few samples (click on these - they're great!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpZFZc_zw8I"&gt;Get the Cat&lt;/a&gt; by Lawson Software.

I would be interested to hear from Bulldog and B2B Magazine how they found these articles. I suspect it was through searching or via a customized RSS feed. In any case, people are listening out there and blog content is like a search engine magnet or a web traffic firecracker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blogging" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/success," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;success,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/b2b" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;b2b&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/magazine," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;magazine,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bulldog" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;bulldog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/solutions," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;solutions,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bloggers" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/unite" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;unite&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/6478311739084443536/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=6478311739084443536' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/6478311739084443536?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/6478311739084443536'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/02/anything-goes-marketing-is-attracting.html' title='Anything Goes Marketing is Attracting Attention'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R7Prw-Nk6vI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/XiUTsXOxcJo/s72-c/bulldog.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-8349111275585729546</id><published>2008-02-07T01:13:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-07T01:54:33.059-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-02-07T01:54:33.059-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web design'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lead generation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='search'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Google'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Web 2.0.'/><title type='text'>Give web visitors the resources they need - Customized Google</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R6qkIYyiJ4I/AAAAAAAAAG4/1pjF03pxxXc/s1600-h/custom_search_sm.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R6qkIYyiJ4I/AAAAAAAAAG4/1pjF03pxxXc/s320/custom_search_sm.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5164120386734008194" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Raise your hand if you answer yes to all of the following questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My company has a website&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have great resources on our website&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of these resources help our customers and prospects learn more about what we do and affect the buying process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's difficult to find these resources on our site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Your hand raised? I've got a fairly simple solution. If you're on my blog (that's directed to my RSS reader friends), you'll notice a shiny new Google search box at the top of the site. This is an example of AJAX (new technology that doesn't require the browser to reload). Try it out! Search for anything you want (here's a good one: "Google Rocks"). Notice how the search results appear as a layer over the current page - isn't that cool? What I like about this is that you don't need to worry about the design of the search results pages and you get the power and authority of Google on your site. In addition, with this Web 2.0 technology, you never leave the page you are on so it's a better web experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best news is that it's easy to implement Google Custom Search Engine and it's FREE. Here's what you do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse/"&gt;http://www.google.com/coop/cse/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on "Create a custom search engine"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fill out the form fields on the next page (add in any number of sites you may want to index)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within the search results hosting option section, select the new "overlay" option. The drawback for bloggers is that you can't get Adsense but hey, if I was blogging for the money I would have quit long ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy the code and paste it on your site&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can customize this but I really didn't do any customization and it looks fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There is also a business upgrade for $100 a year. I've set this search engine up for a non-profit site (because I make tons off this blog - heavy sarcasm) which means that no ads will appear in the search results. Businesses will probably want to purchase the business edition as you'll not want ads on your internal search engine (could be competitors). I think it may be the best $100 your company has spent. If you don't have a site search, you're missing out on an opportunity to help web visitors to find information on your web site and better leverage your web  and overall marketing investments. The easier it is to find the right information, the better chance at conversions and eventually closed deals. I haven't tested this out but you can probably use Google Analytics to track what people are searching on and additional data. If you have an enterprise site, you may want to look at some of the more feature heavy tools out there like Inquira.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have questions or tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Google" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Custom" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Custom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Search" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Engine," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;Engine,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/AJAX" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;AJAX&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/8349111275585729546/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=8349111275585729546' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/8349111275585729546?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8349111275585729546'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/02/give-web-visitors-resources-they-need.html' title='Give web visitors the resources they need - Customized Google'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R6qkIYyiJ4I/AAAAAAAAAG4/1pjF03pxxXc/s72-c/custom_search_sm.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-1485806541649935807</id><published>2008-01-27T20:40:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-27T20:43:11.924-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-01-27T20:43:11.924-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='enewsletter'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='facebook'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='search'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networks'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Marketing Sherpa'/><title type='text'>Email Tips for the New Year Part I</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R50x7YyiJ0I/AAAAAAAAAGM/a89pe_trPBY/s1600-h/anything_goes_marketing_email_tips.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R50x7YyiJ0I/AAAAAAAAAGM/a89pe_trPBY/s200/anything_goes_marketing_email_tips.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160335644372903746" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greetings! I've finally had the chance to go through a number of email newsletters and reports and I wanted to highlight some interesting email tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email Subject Line Tips: Use Personalization and Search Engine Optimization&lt;/h4&gt;I can blog about keeping your subject lines short but you already know that and I just reminded you. :) Here are some additional interesting tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MailerMailer's latest &lt;a href="http://www.mailermailer.com/metrics/TR-H1-2007.pdf" target="_self"&gt;   Email Marketing Metrics Report  &lt;/a&gt;(pdf) indicates that personalized subject lines (eg: "Chad, open this amazing email") dramatically increased open and click rates. The average open and click-through rates for non personalized emails were 15.86% and 2.09% respectively while the averages for personalized emails were 18% and 5.02%.  This is very easy to do and worth testing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the search engine optimization terms that drive the most traffic to your site within your subject lines. This is also easy to do by examining the search terms from your analytics program. Thanks Stefan Pollard over at &lt;a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3627972"&gt;ClickZ&lt;/a&gt; for mentioning that tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your marketing database and your CRM data are synched, you may even be able to find out which words are used by customers vs. prospects and further segmenting the search terms to use for various campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to Target the "Inactives" in Your Database&lt;/h4&gt;Wendy Roth explains in her article &lt;a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/17803.asp"&gt;6 tips to win back inactive subscribers&lt;/a&gt; suggests targeting those people that have not responded to your emails in the last 6 months. One suggestion is to  send on an email to these "inactives" with an incentive to update their profile by entering them in a contest. This does a few things. It lets you know if these "inactive" contacts are still alive if you get a response and you can use the opportunity to ask these people additional lead qualification questions to round out their profiles. With this additional information, you can target these people accordingly. You may find out that there are some diamonds in the rough (as well as some bad apples). Overall, it's most likely cheaper to give away some IJunk (I use that word to summarize IPods, IPhones, ITouches etc...) then the cost to re-build your database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process can be automated by creating a program that sends 2-3 emails over a 3 week period with the offer described above. Other strategies may include further segmenting these inactives by the lead source and other qualification data and creating customized messages for the different segments and using different marketing channels (call campaign, direct mail). I would recommend that the first step is to determine the number of inactives in your database. This should give you an indication as to how active or inactive your database really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Various E-mail Tips from MarketingSherpa' Marketing Wisdom Report&lt;/h4&gt;I've read through MarketingSherpa's "&lt;a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/store/downloads/Wisdom2008.pdf"&gt;Marketing Wisdom for 2008&lt;/a&gt;" which includes 101 real life marketing stories and lessons learned. Here are a few items I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Send a text follow up email to those that didn't open or click on your initial newsletter/event&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (my tip: automate this process if possible using email automation tools). However, text based newsletters may not be received too well if they are used instead of graphical based HTML versions. The best bet is to conduct tests to see if this boosts response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have emails sent from Account Executives if possible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The more personalized the email, the better the response. Consider adding a personal touch above the email header image. For example "Chad - check out this great newsletter below. I think that there are some interesting articles that may be interested in."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Slightly change a headline or subject line in emails sent to different contacts using standardized information in your database&lt;/span&gt;. For example, for a newsletter change the subject line slightly for your different database segments by highlighting an article in the subject line that appeals most to that specific segment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider using social media sites like Facebook and MySpace to grow your lists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Does your company have a Facebook group? Create one and use it to advertise events, product releases etc... Have a look at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7051207106"&gt;MarketingSherpa's facebook group&lt;/a&gt;. There are videos, pics, job postings, discussions - it's awesome!! PS - you will need to join Facebook to see it so stop saying "Facebook is for my 14 year old and I have enough 'friends' and have no intention with reconnecting with people from high school that I didn't really know in the first place". Seriously - join already. There is no such thing as private information in the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just realized that I waited too long to blog as I have a bunch of tips saved up. I will post a part II soon - I need to go see if any of my Facebook friends is celebrating a birthday this week and finish up that game of Scrabulous with my mother in law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope the tips helped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - feel free to look for me on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;PPS - Thanks Bulldog Solutions for mentioning my blog and &lt;a href="http://www.bulldogsolutions.com/bullblog/Responses.aspx?ID=64"&gt;quoting me&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/12/email-and-video-tactics-you-can-use.html"&gt;my post on using video in email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/marketing," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;marketing,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/segmentation," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;segmentation,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tips," rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;tips,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/e-mail" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/best" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;best&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/practices" rel="tag" class="techtag"&gt;practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="result"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/1485806541649935807/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=1485806541649935807' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/1485806541649935807?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1485806541649935807'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2008/01/email-tips-for-new-year-part-i.html' title='Email Tips for the New Year Part I'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R50x7YyiJ0I/AAAAAAAAAGM/a89pe_trPBY/s72-c/anything_goes_marketing_email_tips.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-571967263165124764</id><published>2008-01-09T00:38:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-11T01:06:33.194-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-01-11T01:06:33.194-05:00</app:edited><title type='text'>Lessons Learned in Cost Rica - Being Customer Centric</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R4cGB4GJiZI/AAAAAAAAAGE/tLwW4_9WvYE/s1600-h/Costa+Rica+053.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R4cGB4GJiZI/AAAAAAAAAGE/tLwW4_9WvYE/s320/Costa+Rica+053.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154094927856634258" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My brain is slowly de-fogging from my trip to Costa Rica. My wife and I had a wonderful jammed pack week full of tours, hikes and R&amp;amp;R at the beach. Beyond the beauty of this country and the relaxing siestas in the sun, I was reminded of a valuable lesson - go above and beyond for your customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;We booked an eco-tour which means that we travelled to various areas of Costa Rica to learn more about this wonderful country and the different species that inhabit it. We thought that we were going to be traveling with a bunch of other tourists but we ended up on an empty bus with just a driver and a tour guide. Over the next 5 days we were treated to an entertaining and informative tour through the rain forest and beautiful country side of Costa Rica until we reached the beaches on the pacific side for a few extra days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Going that extra mile for the customer&lt;/h4&gt;What made the trip was our tour guide Jonathon and driver Daniel from &lt;a href="http://www.catours.net/"&gt;Central American Tours&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever we needed, they provided for us. They ensured that we got the most value out of our trip by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;helping us save money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;telling us what was the real coffee to buy to bring back home (and taking us to a shopping center to buy the coffee for the best price)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;suggesting authentic yet inexpensive restaurants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;taking the time to answer all of our questions about the thousands of plants and animals as well as the culture, history and politics of Costa Rica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;providing multiple touring options that enabled us to do what we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;being as flexible as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doing the unexpected. Here are two examples:&lt;br /&gt;1. We wanted to buy a special rosewood walking cane for my father in law. Our tour guide overheard my conversation with my wife and called ahead to the souvenir shop so that they would reserve the cane we wanted (it was the only one of its kind that we saw and we knew what it would mean to my father in law).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R4cD64GJiYI/AAAAAAAAAF8/JZ4ztxrfwE4/s1600-h/DSC01686.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R4cD64GJiYI/AAAAAAAAAF8/JZ4ztxrfwE4/s320/DSC01686.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154092608574294402" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Our driver provided us with a CD of some beautiful photographs of the Arenal Volcano that he took because it was cloudy when we went and we couldn't see that much. I've included one of his photos (while he couldn't speak any English, he was a wizard with his camera and loved showing off the photos he took).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that is going above and beyond. Did it take a lot of effort on their part? no. Was it expensive or resource intensive? no. Would I recommend this tour company and my tour guide? I don't think I have to answer yet. They key here is the effort that was taken, the thoughtfulness and responsiveness. This experience is a good reminder for everyone as you begin 2008 -&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;how can you easily provide greater value to your customers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Happy New Year everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Here are some pictures from my trip that I posted on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=79390&amp;amp;l=3e6e6&amp;amp;id=604410692"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few sample videos that I posted on UTube:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYTPQI0Flgg"&gt;monkey adventure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attack of the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6y9KOWjgCY"&gt;crazy creatures called Quadimundi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPS - We met some great people from our trip and some of them joined our tour when they found out what a great tour guide we had. I plan to keep in touch with many of them via Facebook.

His blog is about the latest in marketing and advertising.

This article may give you some additional information that you didn't have but it's not going to make your sales team start using the CRM properly or get marketing to only pass on qualified leads to sales. It's time to get a grip and at least know that you are not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visit many companies and I repeatedly see the same issues that revolve around marketing and sales are not being on the same page. I do see a few exceptions but I typically see the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing and sales do not have a common definition of a lead (or anything for that matter).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing and sales are not in alignment in regards to the sales and marketing funnel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales do not follow up on leads passed over by marketing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing passes on "crap" (unqualified) leads to sales&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales do not attribute opportunities or closed deals to marketing campaigns (sales is the broken link in closed loop marketing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales use excel to manage their lists and pipeline which limits marketing's visibility into the effectiveness of their efforts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing does not provide sales with the materials and/or messaging needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no defined process to route leads to sales&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no defined process to handle leads that are qualified, yet not ready to buy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales are given the tools to make their jobs easier but refuse to adopt to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing doesn't pass over enough leads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales don't follow the sales/marketing process as it's not enforced by management&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I think I could probably go on here forever - please feel free to add a few more. If you can relate to any of these items above, I've assembled a few resources that you may find useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Five Resources on Aligning Marketing and Sales&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theb2blead.com/marketing-and-sales-funnel/b2b-marketing-and-sales-tip-64-defining-a-lead/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: B2B Marketing and Sales Tip #65 - Defining a Lead"&gt;B2B Marketing and Sales Tip #65 - Defining a Lead:&lt;/a&gt; This post deals with the issue of how to get sales and marketing on the same wave length in terms of defining what a lead is. This post is part of &lt;a href="http://www.theb2blead.com/"&gt;B2B Lead website&lt;/a&gt; and is run by true marketing professionals - worth taking a look for some actionable marketing and sales alignment tips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/08/7-tips-to-impro.html"&gt;7 Tips to Improve Sales Follow-up &amp;amp; Close More Leads:&lt;/a&gt; This post provides some quick tips that can help you steer marketing and sales teams through the rough waters of alignment. What I like about Brian Carrol's post is the give and take. marketing promises to get leads to sales as quickly as possible but if sales doesn't follow up with a lead by a certain time, it will be reassigned. I highly recommend Brian's &lt;a href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/"&gt;Lead Generation Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sellingtobigcompanies.blogs.com/selling/2006/08/download_what_s.html"&gt;What Sales Really Needs from Marketing:&lt;/a&gt; Jill Konrath over at &lt;a href="http://sellingtobigcompanies.blogs.com/"&gt;Selling to Big Companies&lt;/a&gt; has been there and done that when it comes to working with sales and marketing teams.  She has written and excellent e-book which will help marketers get a better understanding of how they can get sales better aligned with their marketing objectives. It really comes down to providing sales with what they need to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketinginteractions.typepad.com/marketing_interactions/2007/11/marketing-with-.html"&gt;Marketing &amp;amp; Sales with a Single View:&lt;/a&gt; This post is a good one because it provides some immediate action items and brings everyone back to the reason you are in business: to serve the customer. Ardath Albee at &lt;a href="http://www.marketinginteractions.com/"&gt;Marketing Interactions&lt;/a&gt; stresses that a common definition of what the customer is looking for will help bring together the various strategies and tactics that are being deployed by individual marketing and sales groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixsigmaselling.com/six_sigma_selling/2007/12/need-to-improve.html"&gt;Need to Improve Salespeople’s Behaviors? Don't Bother with Sales Training or CRM Until You Face the Facts:&lt;/a&gt; I really enjoyed Michael Webb's post over at &lt;a href="http://www.sixsigmaselling.com/"&gt;Six Sigma Selling&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn't pull any punches. If you want sales to buy into new processes, then make sure that the process has been firmly established, it's proven it will succeed and that management is completely bought in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I hope that you find these resources useful.

Grrrr!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across a few interesting tips for your confirmation pages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Using Audio and Chat on Your Confirmation Pages&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R2HZY6DDXTI/AAAAAAAAAFk/SgDfYHHfBHA/s1600-h/confirmation-page.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R2HZY6DDXTI/AAAAAAAAAFk/SgDfYHHfBHA/s320/confirmation-page.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143631271355964722" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In what seems like ages ago, I wrote a post &lt;a href="http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2006/05/blogs-let-rest-of-us-take-back-night.html"&gt;about blogging while being stuck at airport&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Use an audio confirmation clip on your confirmation page. &lt;a href="http://www.deliverymonitor.com/news_confirmation"&gt;Check out how this is done on Delivery Monitor&lt;/a&gt; after you sign up for their newsletter. It's brilliant as it sets expectations (i.e. when you can receive emails, what will be in them) and gives you a bit of the company's personality (which is boring by the way). This is a great idea and you can do a lot with this concept as the confirmation page is like a gateway into receiving additional information. The web visitor has given consent for you to send them emails and an audio message sets the tone for a great relationship. You might also notice that these guys have added a chat feature so you can ask them questions as well. These Delivery Monitor folk are some really bright people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tips for Your Unsubscribe Confirmation Pages&lt;/h4&gt;Stefan Pollard continues to write some brilliant posts on the unsubscribe process. He recommends making this a two step process. Have an unsubscribe link in the email and make the email recipient chose to unsubscribe from the landing page. On the confirmation page, he &lt;a href="http://www.emaillabs.com/email_marketing_articles/lyris-email-unsubscribe-survey.html"&gt;recommends adding the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include a customer contact number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a link to a contact form&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include a feedback survey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a manage your profile link. Perhaps they still want to receive your emails in some capacity. For example, have a way for them to unsubscribe temporarily&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell them how they can re-engage with you at a later point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let them know that they can subscribe to a blog feed via RSS. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The bottom line is that you shouldn't give up on these guys just yet. Your marketing and sales team has fought to get them in your database and you want to keep them there. You also want to extend the same courtesy that you gave them when they first opted in as it's part of the brand experience. It's time to test out some of these concepts to get the most out of your database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any great ideas you've tried?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/1250432473422997869/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=1250432473422997869' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/1250432473422997869?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1250432473422997869'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/12/tips-for-confirmation-pages.html' title='Tips for Confirmation Pages'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R2HZY6DDXTI/AAAAAAAAAFk/SgDfYHHfBHA/s72-c/confirmation-page.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-4836963264265772934</id><published>2007-12-09T11:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-09T13:06:15.578-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2007-12-09T13:06:15.578-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='business blog'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='youtube'/><title type='text'>Email and Video: Tactics you can use Today</title><content type='html'>I may be getting older but I had a crazy flashback yesterday. I went to the movies to see August Rush (I give it 1 thumbs up) and of course I was forced to sit through about 20 commercials that mostly focused on gifts I must buy before the move started. One commercial stood out - a new video phone that is being offered by a mobile carrier up here called Rogers (Verizon is the equivalent the US). I remembered seeing this concept in Star Trek and Back to the Future but low and behold, we finally have created this technology on a portable device!! The bottom line here is that video has come a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to Incorporate Video and Email&lt;/h4&gt;In a recent article on ClickZ called &lt;a href="http://www.clickz.com/3627694"&gt;Testing, Testing, Testing...&lt;/a&gt; Karen Gedney reported that &lt;a href="http://bulldogsolutions.com/"&gt;Bulldog Solutions&lt;/a&gt; started adding video highlights to their emails. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R1wjT6DDXSI/AAAAAAAAAE8/Fd5X6E5eBrQ/s1600-h/Using_Video_in_Email.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R1wjT6DDXSI/AAAAAAAAAE8/Fd5X6E5eBrQ/s320/Using_Video_in_Email.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142023699456810274" align="left" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For example, for an upcoming webinar they shot a very short webinar introduction video, took a screenshot of the speaker from this video and included this in the email invite (see the screenshot). When you receive the email, you can click on the video screenshot and the video opens in a new window. Looks difficult? It's easier then you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the image in the email looks like the video will play directly in the email, that's actually not the case and not recommended as email clients (what you use to read your emails) render emails differently. It's much easier and safer to make the image a link in the email to the &lt;a href="http://content.ivtweb.com/studio1/refresh5/4000/6170/6181/6291/Lobby/default.htm"&gt;actual video player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Results of Incorporating Video and Email.&lt;/h4&gt;Bulldog Solutions reported that with the inclusion of video in their email, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;open rates have increased by 30 percent to 14.09 percent and CTRs nearly doubled to 2.20 percent&lt;/span&gt;. This trend continued for subsequent email campaigns. The results definitely show how video can improve your email success  rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tactics to Incorporate Video and Email&lt;/h4&gt;Here are a few ideas that you can use today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding video intros to event invites (highlighted above)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customer testimonials. If you go and visit your customers, take a long a camera and record a 10 second testimonial. Sales can incorporate these in their communication pieces to prospects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have sales create short video intros that they can include in follow up and intro emails. For example, you meet a prospect at a trade show or live event - what better way for them to get a better sense of who you are and what you've accomplished then by sending an email with a video. This email may then be passed around the company so that everyone has a good sense of who the sales person is that they are dealing with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CEO video messages to customers, prospects and employees. Have the CEO record a video with their video phone at the airport while they're waiting for their flight. This can be used in an email, blog, main website etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Company videos for holiday cards. You can really show off to your customer base the people that make up your company by creating a short video. Individuals from the company can include a short holiday greeting. You can't get more personal then this!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HR videos. These can be corny but if you're a growing company and you want to attract the top people, use video to help paint the picture of who you really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm sure there are many more ideas out there. How have you used video?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qon_jCJqkvM&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Incorporating video into Email is too much Effort&lt;/h4&gt;Yes, this does take some additional planning as you need to get someone who can speak in front of a camera, setup the camera, write a script etc... But come on, how difficult is this with today's technology? We have video phones and YouTube!! If a &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=qon_jCJqkvM&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;three year old&lt;/a&gt; can play &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero"&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/a&gt; and have it posted to YouTube, your marketing team can handle this. It's no longer "Back to the Future" but the future is here and it's time to accept that video should be a key part of your marketing efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - make sure that if you do create videos, upload them to Youtube to increase the distribution of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="tag_list"&gt;Tags: &lt;span class="tags"&gt;&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/clickz" rel="tag"&gt;clickz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/video+and+email" rel="tag"&gt;video and email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Guitar+Hero" rel="tag"&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/4836963264265772934/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=4836963264265772934' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/4836963264265772934?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4836963264265772934'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/12/email-and-video-tactics-you-can-use.html' title='Email and Video: Tactics you can use Today'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R1wjT6DDXSI/AAAAAAAAAE8/Fd5X6E5eBrQ/s72-c/Using_Video_in_Email.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-4732365223170439791</id><published>2007-11-25T16:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-15T20:29:55.490-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2007-12-15T20:29:55.490-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='newsletters'/><title type='text'>Adding a Feedback Survey to an Email</title><content type='html'>Should you or should you not place a survey (form) in your email? I've seen both positive and negative results and all that I can suggest is to test this for yourself. It's a known fact that forms in emails will not render properly in Outlook 2007 and Hotmail but you may find an increase in conversions for forms directly in the email. Again test this for yourself and let me know how it goes. This email goes beyond adding forms to your email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a great blog post by Adan Covati called: &lt;a href="http://blog.bronto.com/bronto_updates/2007/11/quick-and-easy-.html"&gt;Quick And Easy Surveys&lt;/a&gt;. Adam makes the point that you don't need to add a form to an email but you can use links that make it appear like you've added a form. Here is the image he used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R0ntL5IodvI/AAAAAAAAAE0/n3BLh6iA5jA/s1600-h/quicksurvey.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R0ntL5IodvI/AAAAAAAAAE0/n3BLh6iA5jA/s320/quicksurvey.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5136897638564132594" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take this further, why not add a simple link in the footer of your email (or at the bottom) that says: "Did you find this useful? yes/no". The idea here is that some people may be reading your emails but don't feel that the email is applicable to them or are not interested in this topic. You can analyze this data by cross referencing the people who selected "no" with their past email activity and contact data (title, demographics etc...). You can do the same with the people that selected "yes". This may be another way to analyze the success of your email campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out and see if it works on a campaign and then you can decide if it's something that you want to implement across all campaigns. I would start off with your newsletters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="tag_list"&gt;Tags: &lt;span class="tags"&gt;&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email+surveys" rel="tag"&gt;email surveys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email+best+practices" rel="tag"&gt;email best practices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/e-mail+marketing" rel="tag"&gt;e-mail marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/4732365223170439791/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=4732365223170439791' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/4732365223170439791?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4732365223170439791'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/11/adding-feedback-survey-to-email.html' title='Adding a Feedback Survey to an Email'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_lKU6yD-Lo5s/R0ntL5IodvI/AAAAAAAAAE0/n3BLh6iA5jA/s72-c/quicksurvey.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25332113.post-1009832156682927097</id><published>2007-11-11T17:48:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-14T13:42:26.487-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2007-11-14T13:42:26.487-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='email marketing'/><title type='text'>Email Personalization Tip: Improve Response Rates</title><content type='html'>I have a great email marketing tip for everyone this week based on a real email campaign. As part of this campaign, an email was sent out to all customers asking them to fill out a survey. The first email used a generic personalization method. This meant that the email came from a VP which only some of the recipients may know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After achieving a decent response after the first email, a follow up email a week later to those who had yet to fill out the survey. Typically, you see the response rate tail off for subsequent email invites, however, in this case, the number of survey submissions tripled from the original email. Why were response rates so high the second time around? It's all about personalization!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Email response rates tripled for the follow up email&lt;/h3&gt;A few tricks were used to seem as if the account manager was forwarding on the original email. Here is an example of what the top of the follow up email looked like (text was changed and the original message was not included):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subject FW: Looking for your feedback&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi Sam,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently sent out this survey to our most important customers to get feedback on how we're doing. Would you mind taking 30 seconds to fill out this short survey? I'd appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charles Simmons&lt;br /&gt;Account Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P: 555.432.2537&lt;br /&gt;E: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:chad.horenfeldt@eloqua.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:78%;color:blue;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;charles.simmons@hellomarketing.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----Original Message-----&lt;br /&gt;From: Jim Executive, Hello Marketing [mailto:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:78%;"&gt;jim.executive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:78%;"&gt;@hellomarketing.com]&lt;br /&gt;Sent: October 30, 2007 9:07 AM&lt;br /&gt;To: Sam Perkins&lt;br /&gt;Subject: Looking for your feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: rgb(51,102,255)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click here if your email program has trouble displaying this email&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:78%;"&gt;ORIGINAL MESSAGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it looks like the individual account managers just forwarded on the original email, that's not the case. The marketer who executed the campaign just added the above text to the top of the original email, used some simple personalization technology enhancements and fired the email out again to those who had yet to respond. Here are the changes that were made for the follow up email that lead to the high response rate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;Dynamic Personalization Part 1:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;The sender&lt;/span&gt;. The "from line" is from the account manager Charles Simmons and not from Jim Executive. Typically, your clients will know their account managers (if they don't, that's another story). Most of the information coming from account managers is valuable and customers are more likely to open and respond to these emails. The email vendor that you use should allow you to have emails look like they are coming from specific people from your organization and perhaps key off data from your CRM. That's exactly what was done here and was the reason that the "from line" and email signature were dynamically generated for the specific email recipient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;Dynamic Personalization Part 2: The recipient.&lt;/span&gt; This part was "easy". The "Hi Sam" section dynamically populated the first name of the recipient. Notice that in the "To" line above, the first and last name were also dynamically generated. This is part of making it look like the email was forwarded by the account manager rather then being sent by one customer marketer. This leads to my next point on subject line techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;Selling the email as a forward&lt;/span&gt;. An "FW" was added to the subject line for the follow up email to make it look like the email was forwarded on from the account manager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;The final personalization touches&lt;/span&gt;. The "Click here..." link was not used at the top of the follow up email so the first text is displayed at the top of the email is "Hi Sam". Therefore, the email really looks like it was forwarded on rather then sent using a mass email tool. The copy was also very effective as it's very personal. Lastly, notice how the original email header info (from, sent, to information) was used. This made the email more authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;All of these techniques resulted in a very successful campaign that was designed to get the highest amount of response possible. The lesson from this campaign is that the time needed to set up the personalization features is worth it if you believe that the email recipients will respond better to emails sent from specific people who they know within your company. In the example above, marketing can send emails on behalf of the account managers which makes the entire team more efficient and helps achieve the desired company objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any good personalization examples?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 11/14/2007: This example is an internal campaign that my company ran.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="tag_list"&gt;Tags: &lt;span class="tags"&gt;&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email+personalization+techniques" rel="tag"&gt;email personalization techniques&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email+best+practices" rel="tag"&gt;email best practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/1009832156682927097/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25332113&amp;postID=1009832156682927097' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/25332113/posts/default/1009832156682927097?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1009832156682927097'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://anythinggoesmarketing.blogspot.com/2007/11/email-personalization-tip-improve.html' title='Email Personalization Tip: Improve Response Rates'/><author><name>Chad H</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03192337361852995222</uri><email>aquachad@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
