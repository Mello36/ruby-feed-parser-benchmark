			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ms. Sampson does not spin tales. She reports them. As a spectator there is very little narcissism in her writing, she rarely mentions herself. Yet she is present of course; in her choice of topic, in her very unique writing style and ingenuity in description - she is the narrator, she is a cynical bard.</p>
<p>Having read a column or two in the Sunday Times, I decided to purchase her book <a href="http://www.struik.co.za/book.author.action?id=3638"><em>Now You&#8217;ve Gone and Killed Me: True Stories of Crime, Passion and Ballroom Dancing</em></a>. Standing at the far end of the counter at the book store was an older woman. I suppose one could call her elderly but I doubt that&#8217;s how she would describe herself; I was drawn to her, somehow I thought that this was an impressive woman. I asked the attendant behind the counter for the book by Sampson but she got the spelling wrong, we moved to another computer within earshot of the impressive woman. The attendant said &#8220;Oh L-I-N.&#8221; With that clue alone the woman turned her head, focused on me over her glasses and asked &#8220;Lin <em>Sampson</em>?&#8221; Yes, I answered. An odd look crossed her face, faintly disapproving. Naturally I wanted to know her opinion but I, of the wuss variety, find it almost impossible to speak to strangers. So I didn&#8217;t ask.</p>
<p>I speculate instead: There is a very real possibility that the woman in the book store had been a victim of Sampson at one time or another. The foreword to Sampson&#8217;s book is written by Rian Malan. He writes with obvious respect and affection but doesn&#8217;t hesitate to mention Sampson&#8217;s ability to offend. A recent review of Edith Venters&#8217; biography is ample proof of that (do take a gander, it&#8217;s quite harsh but highly entertaining). In addition to refusing to brown nose and insisting on calling it as she sees it, she mostly chooses to embroider the negative in society. Over and over again, picked out and hung up beneath the strobe</p>
<div id="attachment_1232" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 211px"><a href="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/linsampson.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1232" title="linsampson" src="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/linsampson-201x300.jpg" alt="Lin Sampson" width="201" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lin Sampson</p></div>
<p>light that is her critical eye - her penchant for negativity, morbidity and tragic irony seems to know no bounds. If only she wasn&#8217;t so bloody good at what she does. Actually scrap that, thank God we have someone like her:</p>
<p>I once had to justify to a suicidal friend why she had to go on living and as someone who is not too impressed with life in general I had to pause to consider this question. The only answer that I could come up with is that we live for the moments that are ‘real&#8217;, for the tiny bits of magic along the way, for the sense hidden amongst an inordinate amount of crap in the mess that we call life. To me, this is what Sampson writes. From the ordinary to the weird to the insane, they are all moments that are real to her, that captures her mind and forces focus for a while. Because she does it so well we too are drawn in by these moments. In her book she writes about suicide, the frivolous absurdity of the super rich or the marvelous colour that was Trechnicov - she sketches moments of substance very very well.</p>
<p>You might still ask, why does she insist on surgically dissecting people? Why does she relish picking at their innards as a violinist might play a pizzicato? Isn&#8217;t there some truth to the saying that &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have something good to say, do shut-up&#8221;. I for one believe that honesty is vastly overrated compared to silence. Yet in the simple terms of supply and demand, we are oversupplied with public silence and impoverished of honesty. You can take heart that they do limit her word count in the general interest of public safety and specifically to limit collateral damage in the event of spontaneous combustion of dangerously over-inflated egos. No-one makes you read her columns and someone has to be the voice of reason in the saccharine world of social commentary in South Africa. The long and the short of it is; if you&#8217;re not clinically depressed or suicidal, get a copy of her book - she&#8217;s a bloody good writer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/holly.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1202" title="holly" src="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/holly.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Melissa from Holly and the Woods chats to Moral Fibre about the band, their latest album and the hard work involved in making music&#8230;</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know, Holly and the Woods is a recent sensational SA rock band. In the tradition of old school rock, this proper five piece band brags with three guitars, exceptionally smooth vocals and excellent drumming. The guitars on every song is superb with edgy riffs that can best be described as &#8216;good fun all round&#8217;, the drumming is in the old style of less is more. The vocals are absolutely sensational, and holistically this is easily one of the best sounds we have had in SA in a while.</p>
<p>Their first album entitled <em>So I Rage</em> has captivated local audiences. It is always amazing to see a good local band doing well, and Holly and the Woods has it in them to do very well indeed. Unlike some precursor bands, this band has done amazing things in a relatively short amount of time by producing fresh, user-friendly rock and roll with an edge. Essentially this band transcends their art: music. They do this by expertly interrogating the limits of their medium and what ultimately transpires is a vernacular of feeling, communicated through the high art of song.</p>
<p>What is most impressive, is that this alternative rock band’s music is not over-produced, a clear indication that the vocalist can sing, the guitarists can play and the drummer is a human being and not a computer programme. We live in an age where anyone can sound good, and having authentic SA musicians that actually sound good is quite an achievement. That being said, this band is also a good reason for music fans to get out there and start reinventing the wheel in terms of live music shows in SA, and making true the old cliché ‘if you build it they will come’.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to give this band a listen and read more about them, check out their myspaz page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hollyandthewoods">http://www.myspace.com/hollyandthewoods</a></p>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>Your sound is pretty fresh, escaping that grungy girl-rock genre by being musically inspired, super professional and mature. How would describe your sound in terms of genre?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;I’d say we’re straight up Alternative Rock, cause we have a bit of a dark edge to our music.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>As a band, what are your main influences?<br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;The five of us are very unique in music taste, so top five influences for us would be Skunk Anansie (which is what I love), Foo Fighters, Guns &amp; Roses, Dave Matthews Band and Metallica.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>Holly and the Woods is a huge project, that has done very well especially considering that it is hard to do well in SA. How did the band start? How did you guys get here?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;Craig actually found me on a music website, advertising in the classifieds as a vocalist looking for a band and when we found each other Craig was the one scouting for the rest of the band members. It took a year and half to finalize the line-up we have now. I think we still have a long way to go and there’s still a lot of hard work to be done, but what we have achieved so far takes passion and perseverance. The music industry can bring you down and you can lose your motivation quickly if you listen to the negativity most people spread about the music industry. There are too many people saying that there’s no future and money for bands, and that’s the worst thing that you can believe. There are so many opportunities in music and it takes hard work and talent to find them, and a lot of bands have that within them.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>Your album So I Rage hit SA shelves this year, and it has enjoyed amazing success. Shortly after listening to your album I saw your music video on daytime TV – how has the ride been? Does the hard work ever stop?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;We are so proud of our album and it’s amazing to see what releasing an album does for a band. It’s always a tough start at first, especially when no-one knows who you are, but as more and more people hear about you and the press and media start talking about you as well, the better it gets. The hard work never stops though and you have to keep going to succeed. The work actually gets harder the more success you achieve!</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>Like most ‘grassroots’ SA bands you guys started out by gigging yeah? Want to tell us more about what it’s like battling it out as a garage band in clubs?<br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;Currently one of the biggest problems in the SA music scene, is getting the crowds to the clubs. People don’t seem to go out as much as they used to and you can blame it on the petrol price, cost of living and not having enough money to party on, but whatever it is, we need to get our live scene busy again and get people out to watch new up-and-coming bands. We’re fortunate that we have built a nice following and wherever we play we have a great crowd supporting us, but it took a lot of gigging and hard work to get a crowd to follow us. It’s not only the SA Bands suffering, but it’s getting harder and harder for some big name internationals to pack out venues.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>Having listened to your album, and having heard tracks such as ‘Not Like Me’ and ‘Wandering Souls’, I don’t peg you as a feminist, just an artist with an amazing emotional vocabulary. Do you find that people often label you as a feminist or a Grrrl Rocker? </em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;I’ve never been called a feminist, but Grrrl Rocker gets used a lot! I don’t mind it at all. I’m just really blessed that people are stirred by the emotion in our music. ‘Not Like Me’ has actually become one of our biggest songs at gigs and is the one song that seems to help mend relationships or even mend broken hearts after a nasty break-up, cause it’s such a beautiful song.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>In terms of an artistic message, would you like your music to become the anthem of anything in particular?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;If our music ever has to represent something, I would love for it to become the anthem of making your voice heard. To not be afraid to say what you feel and mean. It’s the best release to keep you balanced and relaxed, cause too many people keep their emotions bottled up until it reaches a boiling point and explodes.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>What can we expect after So I Rage? What is on the cards?<br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;We’ve already started writing new songs and we keep maturing and improving as songwriters. I can already say that one of the new songs is very loud with a wicked guitar riff!!</p></blockquote>
<p>&lt;Q&gt;<em>Recently, a band of thuggish Philistines vandalized Craig’s car and stole his kit, what is happening about that?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mel&gt;When a hijacking occurs and everything a musician owns was in that car, it feels like the world has just ended. Craig was shattered after his car was taken with all his equipment in, but the absolute worst for him was the feeling of having a gun put against his head and it being cocked, ready to be fired. We’re just so grateful that nothing happened to him. As soon as it happened we started spreading the news and called out to people to help us find the gear. We sent out e-mails, created a facebook group, called a huge amount of Pawn shops notifying them of the hijacking and to look out for the gear, and handed out flyers at gigs with the Hijacking info on. The response has been unbelievable! We have Primedia’s Crimeline unit aware of the case, also influential people from Ekurhuleni, and fans and fellow musicians wanting to help donate money towards new gear. With everyone wanting to get involved to help Craig get his gear back, we’ve decided to arrange 2 charity gigs in Johannesburg and possible a 3rd in Pretoria to raise money to buy Craig new gear. We’re busy with the arrangements now and will confirm dates soon. So far we’re looking at the End of February for these 2 or 3 gigs. In the meantime Craig has a guitar sponsored by Dean Guitars that he’s borrowing from them and Alan from the band “Concussion Girl” has helped out by borrowing Craig his guitar amp and effects pedal whenever they don’t have a gig. When something like this happens, you truly see the music industry come together to help one of its own… it’s really heartwarming to experience.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us about the Live Without Fear campaign and how it came about</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPHOAC3I/AAAAAAAAB9A/WV2w70vbtas/s1600-h/frank.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPHOAC3I/AAAAAAAAB9A/WV2w70vbtas/s200/frank.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="32" height="43" /></a><strong><span>Frank</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This is how it came about. We realised most of the things that we fail to do in our </span><span>lives as human beings is because we are fearing something. When you fear, at that point you ar</span><span>e not thin</span><span>king for yourself, you are doing things according to how you think others would want you </span><span>to d</span><span>o it. You realise you need to put yourself first, before anyone else. Like when we </span><span>say Fear we don´t say fear of in the larger sense of violence, we speak of fear of yourself, personal fears. It was a collective idea from the whole band and we are all trying to practice it instead of just spreading it.</span> <span><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPdL1SLI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/z38qS1Nn_-w/s1600-h/mathlatse.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPdL1SLI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/z38qS1Nn_-w/s200/mathlatse.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="37" height="43" /></a><strong><span>Mathlatse</span></strong> <span><br />
Chant down f</span><span>ear wa</span><span>s motivated and inspired by a song that I had written when I had my own fears and troubles happening at a certain time. I felt the need to pull through, I felt my fears were holding me back and I wanted to go somewhere in my life. I decided to put al that in a song, to write abou</span><span>t it and that was a way to overcome it. I pitched it to the band and we all liked it, and later PO ca</span><span>me with the idea to turn it into a campaign. Everyone was going through their own fears and it seemed like the right time and thing to do. Especially at home, xenophobia happening it was the right time to do a campaign like this.</span></p>
<p><strong>You are currently campaigning Live Without Fear, tell us about a fear that you personally have overcome in life. </strong><span><br />
</span><br />
<strong><span>DJ Bob</span> (manager)</strong><br />
<span>To be honest I still have many fears about this band. I learnt that using my intuition and following it is</span><span> the best way to overcome fears. My intuition is what I trust and gives me confidence in making decisions with and for the band. That and some of the rewards of spreading the message live without fear, once you see those rewards, in a sense that you have touched someo</span><span>ne and they are empowered, when that happens, it makes you more confident in yourself and moves you forward.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPHOAC3I/AAAAAAAAB9A/WV2w70vbtas/s1600-h/frank.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPHOAC3I/AAAAAAAAB9A/WV2w70vbtas/s200/frank.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="32" height="43" /></a><strong><span>Frank</span></strong><br />
<span>Before I used to fear what everyone thinks of how I compose and present myself on stage. There were articles about me ridiculing how I am on stage and since I am living without fear I don´t care what I think of </span><span>things li</span><span>ke that. I have freed myself from that. The way I play bass too, I realised th</span><span>at I cant play like others play and have to believe in myself, have to be frank with myself and do what feels right to me. I also learnt how to speak without putting boundaries around what I mean, I feel Africans have been denied the opportunity to say whatever they feel because of circumstances and I push away those circumstances and say whatever I feel when I want to say it. In the long run people get to know me the way I am.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPmlUA6I/AAAAAAAAB9Y/gP7BE6J3gKA/s1600-h/monde.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPmlUA6I/AAAAAAAAB9Y/gP7BE6J3gKA/s200/monde.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="33" height="43" /></a><strong><span>M</span><span>onde</span></strong> <span><br />
The campaign</span><span> is a confidence mission. To alleviate any fears you have, me what my fear that has come out is what I spoke about earlier with my family. I was really young, and you don´t realise how much</span><span> it affects you until you are older. I became afraid of crowds, of people, I would maneuver around the edge of a room to avoid people. So the campaign helped me work on s</span><span>omething which I have been dealing with for a long time, on a daily basis. I am now leaving without the fear of being lonely, overcoming my fear makes me feel like I belong and yet can be comfortable with myself when alone.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_h7BgLJ2I/AAAAAAAAB9o/bFWUMTW5D1o/s1600-h/bafana.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_h7BgLJ2I/AAAAAAAAB9o/bFWUMTW5D1o/s200/bafana.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="38" height="43" /></a><strong><span>Bafana</span></strong> <span><br />
I could not be around with many people you know, because some of them used to speak good english. I used to find that I was struggling you know, to even pronounce one word. From then I t</span><span>old myself I </span><span>am going to conquer these fears. I tried to read a book, tried to fix myself, made an effort to show self confidence, look people in the eye, and not hide myself. That helped me to perform. I am here because of a reason, to help those who look like me, who feel like me, to help those who have the same background, to help them to say Yo! man, you gotta chance. They say Kings come from Peasants, from the low places and end up high, even me I am from there but now I see where I am going and I just wanna heal the whole world with my voice and my actions you know.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPUX7lSI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0uX8Rv9lnxA/s1600-h/keitu.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2esM7qEuSSQ/SS_hPUX7lSI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0uX8Rv9lnxA/s200/keitu.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="32" height="43" /></a><strong><span>Keitu</span></strong> <span><br />
Not knowing what is to come, and this fear comes up especially when travelling to a place as far as Norway. So within the brotherhood of Kwani (I am the only girl) I have to find that confidenc</span><span>e within myself. I look in the mirror and tell myself, you are a special human being, you are beautiful, you are here for a reason. Now go share that, and you get back a response, its a give and take. An action and reaction. After a workshop I would come to my room and sit on my bed feeling tearful. You become so humbled, so overwhelmed especially after coming back from a workshop with kids which we have been doing alot of. We discuss dreams, having them, realising them and It is touching and helps us remove many of our fears by helping those kids overcome theirs.</span></p>

<span>Well, today, we did a workshop at a school with children with special needs. For me I always could not face kids with special needs, disabled people. I live in Melville and there is a home for kids who survived fires, who were burned and I often wanted to visit the house and work with the kids but I could not find the courage to face them, I would feel sad and confused about how to interact with them. I overcame, some kind of fear, to interact with special needs people. Today was insightful day for me, we went to a school we gave a workshop and a couple of minutes we just let go. I noticed that ay, these kids are kids with special needs, but there is no difference between us and them. They are children, there is only a slight difference but they are like us. I realised that we so called able people also have special needs and ours might be more emotional but through interacting with these great kids was so therapeutic for us and for me.</span></p>

<span>There is a whole lot of things I deal with internally, first thing I am not a very talkative person. So talking to anyone is sometimes like a major mission. That can be a major barrier because to be understood by the outside world you need to communicate. For me its a major setback but I am constantly fighting it and talking about it. Being in the band forces me to face that fear, sometimes you just got nothing to say and having nothing to say is a problem!</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thesis is a concept store in Soweto that produces its very own line of clothing. Having opened their store on the 16 June 2007, a historical day, it has cemented itself as part of the new designer youth culture in Jozi.</p>
<p>The store itself is a platform for other local brands such as Jozimental, Black Coffee, Love Jozi, Broken Storn, I-kangy and 25hrs toyi-toyi to show their proudly South African styles. Being a concepst store, there is more it than shopping though, magazines and cd&#8217;s can be found there along with local Social Jam Sessions. These sessions are about mixing, mingling, networking and showcasing musical and poetic talent whilst, of course, shopping.</p>
<p>Their line of clothing is urban, South African, sexy and stylish. The above collection was featured at Joburg Fashion Week and we look forward to seeing what they do next. When Creative Director <strong>Mangaliso Radebe </strong>asked this question by <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/article/670/1/soweto_street_fashion" target="_blank">Dazed Digital</a>, this is what they had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to be the main contact point of fashion in Soweto, give assistance to aspiring designers and create a community of creative talent not limiting it to fashion designing but also other areas of design/creativity. Oh, yes also plan to open two other stores in the next twelve months, maybe one in Durban or Cape Town.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thesis.co.za/" target="_blank">Thesis</a> can be found at Mofolo Village 173 Machaba Drive at Mtetwa Stores, Soweto.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Well, its a bit of a recipe actually:</p>
<p><strong>Good Company</strong></p>
<p>This was a given, since I was hooking up with one of my best friends and his girlfriend.  Also, obviously my awesome self was there to ensure any company would be good.  More than that though, I do realise that not everyone is as lucky as I am with friends, so if you need a good night out, call me - I charge R2.50 per hour plus shooters and dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Good choice of where to go</strong></p>
<p>Originally we&#8217;d selected a place called Banana Jam in Clairmont, but when we got there it was noticed that people seemed to be inhaling these white paper looking things that smelled of a sweet and herbal nature.  They were also dining on pebbles.  Fair enough, it did have a bit of a Rastafarian vibe going on, but not really our scene. And so as we ventured back to the car park we were <span style="line-through;"><span style="line-through;">accosted</span></span> greeted by a tall dude wearing a uniform representing another restaurant, <strong><a href="http://www.rubytuesday.com/">Ruby Tuesday</a> </strong>in Kenilworth.</p>
<p><strong>Good Service</strong></p>
<p>What impressed me the most was that as we walked into Ruby Tuesday, the owner got up off her bum and walked us to whichever table we wanted.  The group with us were smokers and we were accommodated with ashtrays and such right at the prime spot of the place and were soon greeted by our waiter who freakishly resembled Gareth Cliff.  Gareth was friendly, accommodating, quick and observant.  Also, he accidentally touched Talfer and put up with our teasing of Talfer liking it and he didn&#8217;t even blush.</p>
<p><strong>Good Food</strong></p>
<p>Look, we did get slightly pickled, which means that we could have been served fly shit on toast and would have enjoyed it, but I can confidently say that the dinner platters were plate lickable.  For real.  In fact, I had to slap my mate who tried to actually lick the plate.  But he&#8217;s a doos sometimes and we don&#8217;t take him out very much for this same reason.  Nevermind.  The food was good, promise.  Not too much garnish, perfect amounts of side sauces, crunchy where it was meant to be and soft where expected.  I can&#8217;t remember what we ordered exactly as it was over a week ago already (read: I was FAR too boozed) but I do know that it involved calamari, sweet potato chips, chicken nugget things, little balls of some type of meat&#8230; er, nevermind.  Just take my word for it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Good Vibes<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It may or may not have been the cocktails talking, but a restaurant must have a good vibe and this one had</p>
<p>tons of it.   We arrived shortly after six and were hosted by cool Capetonians who didn&#8217;t even bat an eyelid when we realized that we were still there at midnight.  Gareth Cliff tried to discreetly undo the umbrellas outside which sent the message across gently that we were beginning to overstay our welcome, but not in such a way that I felt forced to bugger off with haste. I have to make special mention of how funky their bathrooms were.  Red basins, people!  Like, bright red.  Very awesome.</p>
<p>All in all, Ruby Tuesday was a cool find.  If I ever find myself back in the Kenilworth, Cape Town area, I&#8217;d make a beeline right back to it.  And you should too.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/56853856_e261752dce.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1131" title="Cupcakes" src="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/56853856_e261752dce-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><span>First things first: it must be said that in  a world where proving one&#8217;s word&#8217;s worth, hearsay is technically considered  inadmissible evidence and documentary evidence in the form of certificates,  diplomas and degrees are held in highest regard, I am without aforesaid  qualifications in the culinary arts. Yet I submit that I am worthy of my  position as resident foodie at MF for the following two reasons:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>First there is the matter of the universal  truth that everyone is a critic and by virtue of being part of that collective,  I am a critic. Secondly, I love food. And everything about food. The aroma of  freshly baked bread, the sight of pretty cakes, the taste and the texture of  complex salads and then of course, the venue. It is common knowledge among both  my friends that I don&#8217;t enjoy groups but people and crowds and the energy they  give a city is truly magic to me. For this somewhat parasitic reason, I go to  food vendors of various denominations to sit and breathe in that pulse. As such  the venue and the people matter, so that, as marketing people know of women, the  package sells.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> Still, this is a blog about food and to  begin with it is about my favourite food. What I set out to do you see, is to  find the best of my favourites and these verdicts, accompanied by an impression  of the venues will be how this adventure will find gestalt. To be fair the  venues are rarely judged on a one chance and that&#8217;s it basis - two or three  visits are the minimum. An important point to note is that this adventure is  largely for my own pleasure and is thus very subjective but as no one is buying  advertising space on this blog, it&#8217;s also very honest. I&#8217;m not a very finicky  person – I&#8217;ll eat just about anything bar hot cross buns and domestic animals –  and as I have been a (not so very good) waiter once upon a time, I understand  when you&#8217;re spinning (waiters running around like house wives at a sale on their  husbands payday) and the trial that kitchen staff can be, not to mention that  road rage and pms does afflict me now and again. This is again why much lee-way  and the mentioned second chances are given. I am also open to alternate  suggestions and differing opinions. Consider it my pleasure to drag myself out  and try out suggested places. But before you disagree, at least where a winner  is selected, it would be appreciated if you try the winner first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And on that note – gesondheid en lekker  eet!</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">Whilst everyone is propagating the latest social media craze, those hooked upon the den of inequity that is extended social networking, Moral Fibre’s team has been doing some of its own Social Engineering. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">The reason for my diatribe, this little literary sojourn into the mundane nature of marketing, is primarily because I wanted to let you people in on a little secret: guerrilla marketing kinda works and those of you with tighter budgets than the health department’s might consider following a few of Moral Fibre’s handy guidelines. </span></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/lastfmikeatest.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1149" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-right: 2px; margin-left: 2px; float: left;" title="lastfmikeatest" src="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/lastfmikeatest-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="89" /></a><span style="color: #000000;">Firstly, branding, branding, branding; whilst the axiom that your image ought to linger and thus resonate frequently within the minds of your target audience is paramount to your brand’s success you ought to consider the implications of your branding ie. the ethos of your brand. Yes that is right, I am harping on about subliminal messaging the sort of thing the Coke brand(in no way am I Vincent Hofmann making reference to the Coke n’ Cola company for that would be treading on the toes of my demi-god) consistently repeats in their usage of the generally accepted aspirations of the youth, neatly packaged into half a minute adverts, to sell a commodity which ultimately serves only to quench one’s thirst. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">So you should see where I am going with this by now, your brand ought to : </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Identify it’s target audience and by this I mean not simply defining the nearest LSM category which suits your brands pricing structure, your brands position within the market etc. rather what I would have you think about is the ideal-type of consumer, the person with whom you entrust your brands reputation, your brand ambassadors.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Once defined, these ideal-type “model” consumers ought to give you some reflection as to the trajectory of your brand, it ought to compel you to do some society-watching, peering into the formless and timeless void of the cultures which circulate around you which ultimately allows you to understand how to most efficiently to market your brand.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Your budget is tight, time is money and money is best spent reinvesting in your own enterprise.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">When you budding branders wish to market your commodity, the only thing that you can guarantee is that the product is indeed worth buying.<em> Ford would have given me a bear hug for this, but essentially Ford’s principle was to ensure that each individual working on his assembly line would/could one day afford to purchase a black Model T Ford.</em> Whilst there were limited choices in the market place, most of Ford’s employees aspired to own a Model T, much like in the late 60’s with the peak in popularity of the VW beetle, these are cars created and maintained by people, owned by the masses. One wonders why during a turbulent time, such as the insurgency in Vietnam and the veritable climax of the industrial revolution in the 1920’s did two cars come to represent an era? Two common characteristics predominate, namely; </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Both cars were constructed for the people</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Both cars had the reputation that they would never die - even though quite a few did </span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">In marketing terms, for those of you wondering when I am going to get off of my historical wagon and back onto the point, <strong><em>you can only ensure that your product is of the highest quality and that those who market your product are capable of conversing with consumers, rather than simply pitching to them</em></strong>, adhere to these two simple good business practices and those working for you and those purchasing your product will put their faith in your brand. Once you’ve secured these two properties for your brand, your marketing and your customer service will fall into place, because when people can place their trust in your brand, they will sell it effectively, recommend it to their friends and keep endorsing your product. </span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Durban is brilliant! Why? Because it’s 45 minutes from Joburg and when you get off the plane there’s this huge exhalation, like magic that mountain of worries on your back vanishes as soon as you breathe the fresh salty air. It’s tropical, the sea is warm and the locals are Relaxed. And then of course there’s the food! Durban to me is like a big town but if you know where to go, this town has food that you never get tired of eating.</p>
<p>The best scrambled eggs in SA I believe are made with cream – not sure for obvious reasons but it is so light and flavourful, I can’t think of any other explanation. There’s a few options but this morning I had them with cubed tomatoes, Danish feta and fresh basil – oh my gosh! D.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s! Bring me buckets and I’d keep going. These brilliant morsels may be found at <a href="http://www.kznsagallery.co.za/">KZNSA</a> Café (KwaZulu Natal Society for the Arts) in Glenwood, a café and gallery combined. The other break through is that I believe that I have found the best cup cake in SA! After many many many an arduous tasting I <a href="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kznsa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1085" style="float: left; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="kznsa" src="http://www.moralfibre.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kznsa-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="149" /></a>stumbled upon it at <a href="http://www.kznsagallery.co.za/">KZNSA</a> by giving in to my inner four year old last weekend and having one of theirs for breakfast: the secret is the dough which I believe is Madeira cake. It’s heavy, textured, chock full of flavour and delicately balanced with a subtle icing that’s just sweet enough, just creamy enough and completely luscious. It was absolute foodie heaven ? (Unfortunately they are only available on weekends.) The staff are super friendly, requests to change ingredients never get so much as a bat of an eye lid and the atmosphere is of chilled sophistication, do you need any more reasons to drop by?</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" title="KZNSA" src="http://www.siemonallen.org/assets/project_images/cards/cards_kznsa.jpg" alt="KZNSA" width="195" height="146" /></p>
<p>Well here’s another anyway: A huge pro is that the art in the adjacent gallery is so good! I liked it but more than that, love it or hate it, it seems like there’s a trend in Durban of definite improvement in quality; people are generally dressing more sophisticated, restaurants of <a href="http://www.kznsagallery.co.za/">KZNSA</a>’s quality are becoming less rare, cars are more expensive and the installations at <a href="http://www.kznsagallery.co.za/">KZNSA</a>’s gallery has taken a major leap. And I would know! I’ve personally trekked Durban flat in search of quality art only to be more disappointed than not. So as much as I love Durbs, she really has been in need of a bit of spit and polish – it’s so brilliant that it’s finally happening, hooray! For more info check out their site at <a href="http://www.kznsagallery.co.za/">www.nsagallery.co.za</a> which is quite funky albeit a little <em>seinig</em> with pics. On that happy note, until next we eat bon appétit ?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of your final year as a law student you are required to do a certain amount of community service. I chose the divorce court in central Jozi because it felt more ‘real’ than sitting in a pre-fab office on campus, and rumour had it that you never had homework to take home. The purpose of these centers is to provide the poor with some form of legal assistance that is too expensive for them to get otherwise. I would tell anyone that gave me two seconds how much I hated law but this was unequivocally the best part of my degree. Day after day, walking out of court – always late, my poor lecturers’ assistant, bless his patient heart as it was always on a Friday – I felt like I had accomplished something, somehow what I had done that day had touched time and space; an imprint would be left.</p>
<p>Working with juveniles was one of the components of our service, the rest included instituting divorces and help with admin in inquests. My one and only time in juveniles, Bertus, a fellow student and I were waiting in our consultation office in the Magistrates’ Court, discussing the appalling test coming up and alternative options to practicing law. Fridays were slow, we were told. Finally, in walked a bony youth. Eyes very wide, he took his chair on the other side of the desk and Bertus and I started to explain his Constitutional rights as a detainee. Very often, these kids are thrown into jail on a Friday and see no food for the entire weekend. No blankets are given, no parents contacted and at times they are detained with adults. We are supposed to act as a control mechanism to minimize these infringements.</p>
<p>I don’t remember his name but I remember that he was small, he stared fixedly at the desk, answered all our questions with unfailing politeness. You can’t help but think – this kid doesn’t belong here. It wasn’t too long before he broke down crying saying, “Please Madam, please phone my mother.” Of course you’re told to refrain from any personal interaction, specifically not to use your phone for a client’s purposes and of course I looked at the shaking boy and tried to contact his mother at work. No luck. A police officer walked in, laughed at the child and said, “Is this what criminals look like today? How old are you tsotsi?” “Fourteen,” answered the child. The man shook his head in disbelief and left.</p>
<p>When we had completed our line of questioning, the social worker came and let me tell you, the woman was an artist. She asked him about his schooling, his age, his parents and the events that lead up to his arrest.</p>
<p>He ran away from home, he’d been living with ‘friends’.<br />
Where are these friends now, she asked, has he seen them since his arrest?<br />
No. He’d stolen takkies.<br />
What type?<br />
Women’s, a particular brand that wasn’t supposed to be tagged.<br />
How does he know that they wouldn’t be tagged?<br />
His friends told him.<br />
And where were these friends when you were in Edgars?<br />
They were watching from a distance, he took them as his test and walked passed the security guards. There was a noise and then the guard caught him.<br />
“So they set you up and let you take the fall? You must feel like such an idiot?”</p>
<p>She kept on with this style of questioning, a sort of tough love. His skills, she complimented, his errors in judgment, she lambasted. My first reaction was to her tell-it-like-it-is approach was anger and protectiveness because if fate had dealt my cards differently, this could have been me. That delinquent and I had some things in common; absentee parents, a need for attention, a need to belong and few adults who were willing to take the time to give me a tawwe klap or sit me down and point out the bigger picture and the consequences of my actions. On the contrary, people would much rather break you down. And it was this ‘breaking down’ that got me upset. Soon though, her experience paid off; he wasn’t fourteen, he was sixteen and scared to death of going to jail, so he lied. His lips were burnt and his eyes dilated, he was smoking something. They got hold of his stepfather, he’s wasn’t in school, he’d gotten in a fight and ran away.</p>
<p>Still, when we left, I turned around and smiled at him just to be one less person who judged him. Unlike him, I had different choices if I stayed on the straight and narrow. If I studied I could go to the best schools and travel, the opportunities were there if I chose to use them. He got into fights with his step-father and his uncle and he never felt that anyone backed him up. When you’re poor, this is the only thing you can really cling to and without families, the straight and narrow, may seem like an endless road to no where; a job that pays R1000 a month, if you’re lucky. We expect these kids who live in shanty towns, sleep next to adults having sex, listen to domestic violence, witness crime all around them every day to go to school in a government building, to sit, be quiet and study hard with discipline that is magically conjured out of thin air. Somehow they are supposed to grasp that studying will buy them a home and security when there are no books at home, hell their parents can hardly read never mind teach them the value of it in a way that seems real. I know there are exceptions and thank Heavens for these miracles. But they are few and far between, simply not enough to change the culture in South Africa where filthy rich and dirt poor live next to each other from one of entitlement to one of hard work.</p>
<p>In the face of so much that is wrong, there are still people like Mr. Hanekom and Mrs. Radley who run the law clinics on their own time because they recognize that society is everybody’s responsibility. All around us there are opportunities to make kids like these understand that anything is possible with hard work and dedication: talk about education, show interest, explain that bursaries are available and tell of people who made it from the same circumstances. It comes down to the principle of passing it on. And it could ultimately turn this country around so please try it, we’re worth it.</p>
