			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mozilla has released <a href="https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Firefox 3.1 Beta 2</a>, the second development release of the first major update to Firefox 3, released about six months ago.</p>
<p>Firefox 3.1 will bring several new features (most of them pulled back from Firefox 3), along with significant performance, usability, and web standards support improvements.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in.</p>
<p><strong>Tabbed Browsing</strong></p>
<p>Tab browsing is getting much attention in this release. While some dramatic changes like the new <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/11/meet-firefox-31-new-tab-preview-panel/">tab preview</a> or the <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/07/new-tab-switching-added-for-firefox-31/">Ctrl+ Tab switching</a> behavior introduced in Beta 1 have been dropped, there are still some nice enhancements, most of them triggered by the decision to finally make tabbed browsing the default mode.</p>
<p>The tab bar is now always visible and a new tab button has been added to it making tabbed browsing really discoverable for the first time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2507" title="Firefox 3.1 Beta 1new tab button" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ff3b1_newtab.png" alt="" width="143" height="128" /></p>
<p>Another update to tabbed browsing is the implementation of true tab drag and drop between windows (through tab reparenting instead of just a page reload as in Firefox 3), as well as tab tearing or taking a tab to its own window by simply dragging the tab out of Firefox&#8217;s tab bar.</p>
<p>You can also press the <em>Ctrl</em> key while pressing the <strong>Reload</strong> button to reload the current page in a new tab. While this is coherent with overall Firefox behavior, if you tend to use this mouse and keyboard combination for hard page reloads, prepare to be annoyed a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>Performance-wise, <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/08/serious-javascript-performance-boost-for-firefox-31/">TraceMonkey</a>, the JavaScript optimization technique introduced in Beta 1 has gotten stable enough to be enabled by default in Beta 2, unleashing serious performance improvements.</p>
<p>On my tests it runs the <a href="http://www2.webkit.org/perf/sunspider-0.9/sunspider.html">SunSpider</a> benchmark in half the time it takes Firefox 3.0.4. In <a href="http://dromaeo.com/">Dromaeo</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s own JavaScript benchmarking, it shaves one third of the total run time.</p>
<p>A change in the way web feeds are updated, now prevents some &#8220;mysterious&#8221; hang ups that were somewhat common when you had a large number of feeds or lengthy feeds.</p>
<p>A number of query optimizations have improved overall performance of Places, particularly in Linux where some SQLite operations resulted on excessive file system activity due to the way Linux works.</p>
<p>A standard way to declare, create and run web page background processes (like JavaScript code) called <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">web workers</a>, will enable web developers to create more responsive rich internet applications where complex scripts don&#8217;t put the whole interface on hold.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p>One of the main concerns with the introduction of the awesome bar in Firefox 3 was that it could accidentally reveal a web site you have visited that you don&#8217;t want others to know about. Firefox 3.1 includes options to exclude tags, bookmarks or history items from the awesome bar results that were originally planned for Firefox 3. You can either filter them in using the default operator while typing in the location bar or make it permanent setting a few preferences in <em>about:config</em>.</p>
<p>The most important change, however, is the introduction of Private Browsing mode. In the Tools menu, you select Private Browsing and all pages visited, searches, completed forms, cookies, and download history will be removed when you exit Private Browsing or you exit Firefox (normally or because of a crash).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2891" title="Firefox Private mode" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/privatemode.png" alt="" width="356" height="227" /></p>
<p>The only hint right now is the text (Private Browsing) added to the title bar. A better way that balances the need to let the user know he is in private mode, and the need to not tell pass byers you&#8217;re doing &#8220;private stuff&#8221; will be added in the next Firefox version.</p>
<p>Interfaces are provided for extension and theme developers to detect the mode and act accordingly. In fact, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9517">Toggle Private Browsing</a> is an extension that already adds a buton to the toolbar to turn private browsing on and off.</p>
<p>If you forgot to enable private browsing, the previous <strong>Clear Private Data</strong> dialog (via the <strong>Tools</strong> menu) is now <strong>Clear Recent Data </strong> which let&#8217;s you discard private data for the last 1, 2, 4 or 24 hours.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2775" title="Clear private data in Firefox 3.1 Beta 2" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/clear_history.png" alt="" width="391" height="285" /></p>
<p><strong>User Experience<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The first change you will notice is during the setup. As announced before, <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/11/kiss-firefox-eula-goodbye/">Mozilla has removed the EULA </a>from the setup process. Instead, an information bar will appear on the first launch with a link to <em>about:rights</em>, a new internal page that explains Firefox license and trademarks terms. Firefox now requires only three clicks for typical installation.</p>
<p>A label has been added to the location bar with &#8220;Search Bookmarks and History&#8221; aimed for new users. The hint is displayed only for new tabs, and when you move the focus to somewhere else, so you won&#8217;t see it that often.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2715" title="Location bar hint" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/locationbarhint.png" alt="" width="267" height="37" /></p>
<p>Now that the tab bar is always visible by default, the throbber (activity indicator) has become redundant as each tab has its own, so it has now out of the toolbars by default.</p>
<p>Updates are more informative and show how long it will take. Add-on updates (specially large ones) would also benefit of this enhancement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2712" title="Download update status" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/update_status.png" alt="" width="449" height="162" /></p>
<p>Support for recent MacBooks&#8217; multitouch trackpads is also available, with gestures for navigating back and forward (three finger left or right swipe), move to the top or the bottom of the page (swipe up and down), zoom (pinch in or out), and swithc tabs (twist clockwise or counter clockwise). With Windows 7 expected to include support for multitouch interfaces sometime in 2010,  good to know Firefox will be ready and awaiting.</p>
<p>Gestures can be customized via <em>about:config</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2707" title="Firefox 3.1 touch pad gesture customization" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gesture_customize.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Links to external resources such as JavaScript files or CSS files are now clickable when viewing a page source code.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2892" title="Firefox view source" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/source.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A new <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/10/finer-session-restore-for-firefox-31/">session restore dialog</a> now lets you select what windows and tabs you want to restore after a crash helping isolate the problematic tab or plugin and prevent.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/session_restore1.png" alt="" width="493" height="385" /></p>
<p>The Google search icon has been updated to the new blue &#8220;g&#8221; Google introduced earlier this year.</p>
<p>Library management gets a tad easier with the ability to edit several bookmarks at a time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2503" title="Tag edit for multiple bookmarks" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ff3b1_tagedit.png" alt="" width="352" height="428" /></p>
<p>Tagging can be faster now with tag autocomplete for bookmarks and history.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2710" title="Firefox 3.1 tag autocomplete" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tag_autocomplete.png" alt="" width="323" height="205" /></p>
<p><strong>Web Content</strong></p>
<p>Several content related improvements have been available since the alphas and previous beta.</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS media queries improve developers customization options to deliver content appropriate for the user&#8217;s screen size, resolution and color capabilities.</li>
<li>Query selectors let web programmers more effectively access relative page elements for better applications performance.</li>
<li>Support for HTML 5 drag and drop specification will also ease this common task.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/09/firefox-31-gets-cool-web-page-transformations-support/">CSS transformations</a> and <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/web-tech/2008/09/15/svg-effects-for-html-content/">SVG effects for HTML</a> elements dramatically expand the possibilities for web designers with options to rotate, scale, blur, or solarize web elements a matter of a couple of lines.</li>
<li>Support for embedded fonts (<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/index.php?title=En/CSS/%40font-face">@font-face</a>) will allow users to get the very same font and overall result the web designer intended.</li>
<li>Cross-site XMLHttpRequests support is back in Firefox 3.1 now that the specification is complete. it will allow AJAX web applications to pull content from other web domains if the server allows it.</li>
<li>Support for color profiles introduced in Firefox 3 is now enabled by default.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/transform.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2387 aligncenter" title="CSS transformation in Firefox 3.1" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/transform.png" alt="" width="500" height="289" /></a></p>
<p>Beta 2 gains 4 more points in the <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid3</a> test since Beta 1 to 93/100, and a handful of patches still awaits for review that could push the mark to 97 as demonstrated in <a href="http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2008-10-03/experimental-builds-latest-acid3-patches">experimental Windows and Linux builds</a> prepared by Ehsan Akhgari.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2890" title="Acid3 results  on FF3.1 bea 2" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/acid3.png" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></p>
<p>Introduced in Beta 1, <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/09/geolocation-support-added-to-firefox-31/">Geolocation</a> will enable Firefox to pass the current user location (with varying levels of precision) to web sites that ask for it to provide customized content. <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/10/introducing-geode/">Geode</a>, a Firefox 3 extension released some time ago, aims to test this feature in advance of Firefox 3.1 release to spot and address possible bugs, and most importantly, privacy concerns.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2506" title="Geolocation in Firefox 3.1 Beta 1" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ff3b1_geoloc.png" alt="" width="500" height="72" /></p>
<p>Beta 2 also expands previously introduced support for <em>&lt;audio&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;video&gt;</em> tags and native support for open and free Ogg Theora and Vorbis video and audio formats with support for .wav streams.</p>
<p>Video objects got a context menu, and videos can be viewed on their own, so Firefox can register itself as a Vorbis and Theora player.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2713" title="Firefox 3.1 video menu" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/video_menu.png" alt="" width="365" height="298" /></p>
<p><strong>More to come</strong></p>
<p>With a third beta in the horizon there&#8217;s still room for some planned features to get in including Windows theme refresh and polishing, tab animations, and better audio/video playback controls are all expected to land soon, along with the usual dose of performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>A reviewed location bar that would exclude bookmarks tagged as &#8220;private&#8221;, and will search open tabs has been pulled back from this release.</p>
<p>As usual at this stage in a new release development, most add-ons are not compatible with 3.1 yet, but extension interfaces are frozen with very specific exceptions now, and developers are being encouraged to start updating.</p>
<p>Internally, Mozilla has created a separate branch to continue Firefox 3.1 development, while code for future versions (tentatively, Firefox 3.2) gets checked in to the trunk.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a-me! Mario!&#8221;, right here, in your back button.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9858">Mushroom Kingdom</a>, by Matt Coxwell, brings the joyful colors of Mario&#8217;s video game adventures to your favorite browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9858"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2880" title="Mushroom Kingdom theme" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mushroomkingdom.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The customization is limited to the main window and the toolbar background starts tiling just above 1000 pixels wide, but who cares? Mario and Luigi go to sleep if there&#8217;s nowhere to go back or forward!</p>
<p>This is the best to happen to Mario since Super Mario Galaxy. Or maybe Kart Wii.</p>
<p>Anyway I suggest all Mario fans unite and push Matt to theme uninterruptedly until his work is complete.</p>
<p>Available at Mozilla Add-ons with account required at this time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After about two years in the works, Pioneers of the Inevitable have released Songbird, a Mozilla-based music player, with which, POTI aims to do for music what Mozilla did with Firefox: provide an open source customizable multiplatform music player.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2874" title="Songbird main window" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/songbird.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><span id="more-1261"></span>On first sight, it doesn&#8217;t look much different than several other media players like iTunes. Like it, the user interface is dominated by the music library with music in your computer, play controls at the bottom, a search bar that includes SkreemR (an mp3 search site) and The Hype Machine (a music blogs search site), and a tab bar.</p>
<p>As a music player, Songbird uses <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a>, an open source multimedia framework and can play MP3, FLAC and Vorbis files in all platforms;  AAC on Windows and Mac; and Windows Media Audio (with and without DRM) on Windows only.</p>
<p>There is no CD playing or ripping capabilities however, which depending on your music buying habit may be a deal breaker or not. Personally, it&#8217;s been a long while since I ripped a CD as most of my music comes from eMusic, amazon MP3 or Walmart MP3 (serving Puerto Rico, yay!).</p>
<p>Podcast support is weak. You can only manually add podcasts URLs via the File/New Subscription&#8230; menu which is unbelievable for a player that is basically built on a browser.</p>
<p>Cool enough, it supports my Dell Inspiron media buttons right out of the box, and I can define as many hotkeys as I want.</p>
<p>Performance wise it took 2 minutes to import my songs (about 7,000) which I found pretty fair, and I have nothing to complain about the user interface responsiveness.</p>
<p>Its memory footprint however is another topic: 76 MB on Windows XP SP3. Being a Winamp user for more than a decade now, it seemed pretty high to me at first , until I gave a look at the task manager and found that Winamp is around 52 MB right after launch. When minimized, Songbird drops to about 25MB while Winamp practically disappears to about 5MB.</p>
<p>I can live with that.</p>
<p>A unique feature Songbird introduces is integration with digital music stores, providing the richness of a desktop application widgets to music sampling and downloading on sites that use the <a href="http://wiki.songbirdnest.com/Developer/Developer_Intro/Webpage_API">API</a> and documentation POTI published.</p>
<p>Just like Firefox, what sets Songbird apart is its extensibility. There are currently about 300 add-ons at <a href="http://addons.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird Add-ons</a> including feathers (themes) to change the application look and feel.</p>
<p>Extensions add a wide variety of customization from iPod support (not for iPhone or iPod Touch yet), to some Firefox classics like VideoDownloader, Stylish, FlashGot, Minimize to Tray, NoScript, StumbleUpon, and a few others. Plus some new interesting ones like LyricMaster, that displays the correct lyrics in the right pane as soon as a new song starts playing. Press a button to add them to the track&#8217;s tag.</p>
<p>SongTapper, a service that let&#8217;s you search for a song by tapping the melody with the space bar is also quite addictive. Eyecandy lovers who crave for iTune&#8217;s album browsing good looks, will appreciate MediaFlow.</p>
<p>Add-ons just like Songbird itself benefit of Firefox&#8217;s update service mechanisms so staying current is a breeze.</p>
<p>Perhaps once you hear about Songbird add-ons and music store integration you will start to realize there&#8217;s something different about Songbird that escapes the typical definition of a media player. POTI calls it a &#8220;web media player&#8221; which I believe is an accurate description: it harnesses the power of the web to expand the music experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can&#8217;t right click on a song and search for the artist, song, or album on Wikipedia, AMG or Rolling Stone, for example.</p>
<p>Songbird is a different media player conceived for a different music fan. One that is most of his time connected to the web where the experience can be extended with more multimedia and the social factor of this decade&#8217;s Internet.</p>
<p>I will avoid calling it an iTunes killer because, first, that&#8217;s setting the bar too low, and second, it is about selling content and keeping you inside Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, lowering the bar even more.</p>
<p>Songbird future looks very promising. According to the roadmap, watch folders, album art download, crossfading, and normalization are all coming in February 2009. CD ripping, an equalizer, and customizable toolbars should follow in April.</p>
<p>You can download <a href="http://wiki.songbirdnest.com/Developer/Articles/Builds/Nightly_Builds">Songbird 1.0</a> from <a href="http://getsongbird.com/">getsongbird.com</a>. Available for Windows (13 MB), Linux (28 MB),  and Mac OS X (31 MB).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a>, the makers of the eponymous Firefox-based web browser, have <a href="http://www.flock.com/node/64720">released the first alpha version of OpenID for Flock</a>, a Flock extension that provides the necessary user interface to add OpenID credentials and easily select one to identify in a <a href="http://openid.net/where/">growing number of services</a> that already support it.</p>
<p>As you may know, OpenID is an open identification system that aims to deliver a unified way to access virtually any web service that supports it:  you just provide your OpenID to the web service, it recognizes who is providing your identity and will redirect you there to enter your password. The id provider then validates you and if everything goes OK it takes you back to the web service letting it know you have been identified.</p>
<p><span id="more-2870"></span>OpenID for Flock works very intuitively. It adds a button to the toolbar that you should click first to add your OpenID or OpenIDs: just type the URL (OpenIDs look like web addresses) and press validate to check with your provider that the id exists.</p>
<p>In the screenshot below I have added my OpendID provided by Yahoo! and another by myopenid.com</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2871" title="OpenID for Flock add id" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/openidforflock.png" alt="" width="322" height="347" /></p>
<p>From then on, when you visit a web service that supports OpenID, the OpenID button will glow. You then click on it to select an OpenID you want to use to identify with the service. You will then be sent to your provider for authentication and sent back with the results of the process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2872" title="OpenID for Flock, detected" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/openidforflock_detect.png" alt="" width="256" height="244" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long way for OpenID so far and it is good to see serious attempts to push its adoption, but also exercises on what an intuitive user interface should look like. OpenID is very hard just to explain and understand so it&#8217;s also a real challenge for UI designers.</p>
<p>I tried to edit OpenID for Flock to fit into Firefox by modifying the application ID in the extension file but I only got the button in the toolbar and none of the functionality. But I guess it won&#8217;t be long before we see a Firefox version.</p>
<p>Flock users can get it from <a href="https://extensions.flock.com/extensions/#openid">Flock Add-ons repository</a>.</p>
<p>You can get an OpenID now from several providers including Yahoo!, MyOpenID, MySpace, and Vidoop.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6510">FoxReplace</a> is a Firefox extension developed by Marc Ruiz that brings the ability to search and replace text occurrences in a web page.</p>
<p>It adds an intuitive menu item to the Edit. Unfortunately the most common <em>Ctrl + H</em> keyboard shortcut is already in use by the History sidebar, so you will have to settle with <em>Shift + F2</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2863"></span>The replace dialog (displayed at the bottom of the current window) allows you to search whole words, parts or use regular expressions. You then enter what you&#8217;re looking for, what you want it replaced with, set case sensitivity, hit the <strong>Replace</strong> button and all substitutions happen at once which may be a limitation in some situations.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2864" title="FoxReplace" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/foxreplace.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is no option to search and replace on a text area only which I would really appreciate. It also abuses the Tools menu adding yet another item to set rarely used options.</p>
<p>Substitution rules import and export and automatic replacements are an overkill for me but the options are there anyways.</p>
<p>If you do a lot of editing in the web you will most likely appreciate <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6510">FoxReplace</a>, available at Mozilla Add-ons.</p>

<p>&#8230; and Firefox. Here are three beautiful themes to make it snow on your desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9762">Xmas</a>, by Matt Coxwell, my current favorite. It is an experimental theme so you will need a Mozilla Add-ons account to get the cute snowy roofs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2861" title="Xmas" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/xmas.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3918">Tinseltown</a>, another classic theme by Twister Mc.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2859" title="Tinseltown" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tinseltown.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9690">Winter Holiday Christmas</a>, developed by Brand Thunder, is technically an extension that includes a useless toolbar with links to Amazon, a few Last.fm stations, and evite. At least you can hide the toolbar and keep the well done theme.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2860" title="Winter Holiday" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/winter-holiday.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>It is currently limited to a couple dozen featured add-ons and not the whole repository. I, and I guess many other users, would like to see this feature extended, and with options to save different packages so you can download them again in the future. A handy trick for reinstalls.</p>
<p>According to Mozilla Marketing&#8217;s <a href="http://www.giantspatula.com/?p=57">David Rolnitzky</a>, more than 5,000 add-ons have been downloaded more than a billion times (a.k.a. 1,000 million), confirming once again, that customization is one of the main advantages Firefox has over a growing number of competitors.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2823" title="Firefox 3.1 tear tab feature" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/teartabmenu.png" alt="" width="243" height="262" /></p>
<p>The feature, that mimics Google Chrome&#8217;s behavior, had been requested and planned several times in the past.</p>
<p>Tab tearing is the latest in a long list of <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/09/overhauled-tabbed-browsing-for-firefox-31/">tabbed browsing improvements</a> that already included a new tab button, a tab preview panel, tab reparenting for true tab moving across windows, tab cloning, and visual tab switching. Some of the changes follow a design shift to make the tab bar visible at all times, which has also got the throbber out of the menu bar, as it is now redundant with each tab&#8217;s activity indicator.</p>
<p>Animations for moving, opening and closing tabs was also mentioned for Firefox 3.1 but it&#8217;s still unclear if will make it.</p>
<p>As usual with new features, tab tearing has introduced a few new bugs, but, hopefully, they will all be ironed for Firefox 3.1&#8217;s next development release, Beta 2, due within the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>It was also the first live test for PRACA, (Problem Reporting Analysis and Corrective Action), the Bugzilla-based application used by mission control to track problems with the space shuttle.</p>
<p>Bugzilla is the bug tracking system developed and used by Mozilla for all its projects, as well as a <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/installation-list/">long list of other companies and projects</a> ranging from the Linux kernel to Facebook.</p>
<p><span id="more-2817"></span>Developed by NASA&#8217;s <a href="http://hci.arc.nasa.gov/">Human-Computer Interaction Group</a> at the Ames Research Center with help of <a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">Everything Solved</a>, a consulting firm founded by <a href="http://avatraxiom.livejournal.com/94384.html">Max Kanat-Alexander</a>, one of Bugzilla&#8217;s main developer, PRACA &#8220;is replacing a set of more than 40 different database systems that had been used over the past 30 years by the many different parts of that Shuttle ecosystem&#8221;, said Alonso Vera, HCI Group lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technicians will be able to make changes to either PRACA or IFI more or less on the fly, rather than having to submit any proposed changes to the publishers of proprietary software, steps that often took weeks to achieve.&#8221;, Vera added.</p>
<p>PRACA is expected to live long. It is already in use in the Constellation program that will replace the space shuttle after 2010.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mozilla has released Firefox 3.0.4, the fourth update to Firefox 3, released last June.</p>
<p>As usual, this release brings several stability and performance bug fixes, as well as, according to the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0.4/releasenotes/">release notes</a>, some security patches.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 9, 2004, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-11-09.html">Firefox 1.0 was released</a> starting Browser Wars II, not just a fancy name, but the sign of active web development users haven&#8217;t seen since the web fell in a hole and stayed there for about six years.</p>
<p>Innovation, security, extensibility, web standards, and performance, have been its drivers since day one. It has paid off: 20% global market share, 700 million downloads, a Guinness record, 200+ million users, thousands of extensions, hundreds of themes, 50+ languages.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the web landscape is no longer a matter of one vendor, but a variety of options where the organic web can grow, change, diversify, and, most importantly, serve; adapting to people&#8217;s needs, technology, and history.</p>
<p><span id="more-2803"></span>Here&#8217;s an screenshot of how Firefox 1.0 looked the day it was launched. Of course, Vista didn&#8217;t exist those days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2804" title="Firefox 1.0" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/firefox1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I ran the SunSpider JavaScript performance test, and found it scored a meager 16,000ms. To put it it in perspective, Firefox 3.0.3 scores about 4,500ms and Firefox 3.1 nightlies are around 2,200ms. Need more perspective? Internet Explorer 7 scored 35,000ms. All tests were ran on an Inspiron 6400 Core 2 Duo 2GHz, 2GB.</p>
<p>Firefox 1.0 also scored 36 on the Acid3 web standards test. Compare it to 92 with Firefox 3.1 nightlies and 75 in Firefox 3.0.3. Still not that bad I believe for a 4 year old browser.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to Firefox, the cool product that enables an open web. But most importantly, to the cool project led, executed, and supported by hundreds of people who write the code, localize it, extend it, test it, build it, distribute it, support it, use it, talk about it.</p>
<p>Firefox proves once again that people is the key to success.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firefox 3 introduced tighter OS integrating across all platforms, and even different Strata (Windows theme) flavors for Windows XP and Vista. However the result was not optimal and there is room to make Firefox feel more native.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2794" title="Firefox 3 on Vista" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/vista_normal.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><span id="more-2696"></span>Start with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7336">Glasser</a>, an extension developed by Matthew Holder that adds Aero translucency to the whole Firefox toolbar area and not just the title bar. Strangely, after 5 months and 128 reviews averaging 5/5 starts it is still labeled as experimental, so you will need a Mozilla Add-ons account.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2795" title="Firefox 3 on Vista with Glasser" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/vista_glasser.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Second, you can make the bookmarks toolbar look like regular Vista toolbars with a glossy blue effect. If you&#8217;re using Stylish, just install <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/7993">this user style</a>, otherwise copy the code and paste it in your userChrome.css file (located in your profile folder).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2796" title="Firefox 3 on Vista with media bar" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/vista_bar.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Third, tabs and group boxes look out of place in Vista. Note the border below tabs and the incorrect background color in the group boxes titles in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7336"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2700" title="Firefox 3 on Vista with ugly tabs and group boxes" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/vista_ugly.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/7019">This style</a> will make them look as they should:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2698" title="Firefox 3 on Vista with correct tabs and group box labels" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/vista_ok.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, you can remove the menu bar installing <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4550">Compact Menu 2</a>, by Millie C. After restarting, right click on a toolbar and select <strong>Customize&#8230;</strong> Add the Compact Menu button somewhere in the navigation toolbar and press <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<p>Right click again on a toolbar and uncheck the <strong>Menubar</strong> to hide it. You can still access all menu actions via the Compact Menu button.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it looks in the end.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2797" title="Firefox 3 on Vista, no menu" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/vista_final.png" alt="" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Add-ons, and extensions in particular are pretty much what put Firefox in a class of its own when it comes to web browsers comparison.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of extensions there are some very notables that have become classics on their own right. An example of these is Stylish.</p>
<p>userContent.css and userChrome.css, are two files located in Firefox profile folder, that let you customize how any web site and Firefox itself look ,respectively, by defining CSS rules. The problem is: you have to know how to define a rule (CSS), what to modify, where to find the files, then restart to see if it works. While (fortunately) this is fun for a few users, for a vast majority it is a barrier.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2790" title="Wikipedia normal and styled" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wikipedia.png" alt="" width="408" height="266" /></p>
<p>Enter Stylish, created by Jason Barnabe.</p>
<p>For the enthusiast, it eases the development of such re-stylings providing tools to manage styles, enable and disable them without requiring restarts, coding hints, and even a cool data URL generator that allows including files (images usually) as part of the restyling.</p>
<p>But most importantly it provides a dead simple way to acquire some of thousands of styles that other users have created from <a href="http://userstyles.org/">userstyles.org</a>, a huge repository you can browse (and preview in most cases).</p>
<p>When you find one that you would like to try, just press <strong>Load into Stylish</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stylish_load.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2799" title="Load into Stylish" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stylish_load.png" alt="" width="250" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>You will be asked for confirmation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2785" title="Stylish confirm load style" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stylish_confirm.png" alt="" width="419" height="230" /></p>
<p>You can choose to <strong>Save</strong> it (an enable it) or first preview what it does. If the style is for a specific page, you will have to switch to a page in that domain to see the effect. If you are satisfied then press <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>You can manage your styles by clicking on the status bar icon and selecting <strong>Manage Styles&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2787" title="Stylish status bar icon" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stylish_statusbar.png" alt="" width="205" height="147" /></p>
<p>Here you can enable or disable, delete or edit them. As you see in the screenshot, it also shows what each one modifies: Firefox user interface or a specific site.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2786" title="Stylish, manage styles" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stylish_managestyles.png" alt="" width="458" height="248" /></p>
<p>In brief, a powerful extension that takes the complexity out of Firefox&#8217;s customization power.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a> is available from Mozilla Add-ons.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the Power to Developers conference in Sidney, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO was asked why Microsoft insists in building its own rendering engine,  when there are open source options that have demonstrated to be better and faster implementing web standards.</p>
<p>Ballmer&#8217;s answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="storybody">There will still be a lot of proprietary innovation in the browser itself so we may need to have a rendering service.</p>
<p class="storybody">Open source is interesting. Apple has embraced WebKit and we may look at that, but we will continue to build extensions for IE 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="storybody">I guess this is almost news as he could have just discarded the possibility completely.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Mozilla requested Ubuntu to show Firefox&#8217;s End User License Agreement on Firefox first start, the Ubuntu and other <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/09/the-ubuntu-community-challenges-the-firefox-eula/">free software advocacy communities cried foul</a>, because for some reason, stating the obvious (that Mozilla is not liable for whatever happens to your computer and that the software is free) is not in tune with the open source spirit.</p>
<p>Mozilla agreed to remove the EULA prompt, and Ubuntu 8.10 shipped without it. Now Firefox users get an information bar on first launch:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2766" title="Ubuntu rights prompt" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ubuntu_start.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><span id="more-2758"></span>Which links to a new internal address (<em>about:rights</em>) where users are told about their rights:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2760" title="about:rights" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/aboutrights.png" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Sounds like a summarized EULA to me, but apparently it makes people happy enough. Personally I don&#8217;t have a problem with this or the previous agreement.</p>
<p>Anyway, the net outcome is that we all get one less window to click when installing Firefox, as today&#8217;s Firefox 3.1 Windows and Mac OS X nightlies installers exclude the EULA prompt and just like on Linux, prompt with an information bar with a link to the new <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">EULA</span> agreement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2767" title="Windows rights prompt" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/rights_windows.png" alt="" width="494" height="194" /></p>
<p>The fix will be seen on Firefox 3.0.5 and later as code for the 3.0.4 update was already frozen last week.</p>

<p>They are: Jeremy Glassenberg, Bruno Fleurquin, Luke Baxter, Alex Polvi, Phani Kumar V and Uttam B, Andrew Stein; Roberto Michelassi, Elena Gorelik, Mischa Lumiere, Eileen Buenviaje, and Jason Williams (student team from The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business); Mohsin Afzal, Naveed Alam, Deval Delivala, and Feng Yuan Xu (student team from Haas School of Business); Pejman Pour-Moezzi, Ornwassa Siamseranee, Harvey Villarica, and Jacqueline Yuen (student team from Haas School of Business), and yours truly.</p>
<p><span id="more-2739"></span>Yep. I was pleased to learn last night that my entry qualified for the next phase.</p>
<p>Finalists now have to prepare a more detailed proposal around basically the same points: feasibility, time line, business sense, and budget, before the December 5 deadline, when all ten proposals will go public for general voting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for Firefox 3.1 Beta 2, due around mid-November, the Firefox development team is furiously completing and landing important features to the code base.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s nightly features the long ago announced tab preview panel that replaces the All tabs list it used to feature in the far right side.</p>
<p><a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/alltabs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2736" title="Firefox 3.1 tab preview" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/alltabs-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-2734"></span>As you can see it shows your currently open tabs (nine at a time) separated in pages identified by dots at the bottom (a la iPhone/iPod Touch) you can click to change.</p>
<p>The tab search bar (at the top and center), is a great help to get to the tab you need when you have more than 20 tabs or so, specially now that tab searching from the location bar has been phased out of the Firefox 3.1 development cycle. As you type on it, tabs are filtered based on the page title only, no full page or web page address search.</p>
<p>Another thing the thumbnails lack is a close tab button which I see no reason to be missing: Fennec has it, Internet Explorer 7 has it. Even Windows 7 will have it in its new task bar.</p>
<p>I hope it would become a real tab manager with options to organize, reload, pin and copy as well. Most likely, an extension will take on this before too long.</p>
<p>Tab switching (pressing Ctrl + Tab) is also using this larger tab preview panel instead of the single row we saw in Beta 1. Still, you can disable tab switching preview setting <em>browser.ctrlTab.previews</em> to false via <em>about:config</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2729 alignleft" title="Theora" src="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/theora.png" alt="" width="100" height="83" /></p>
<p>The Xiph.org Foundation announced the release of <a href="http://www.xiph.org/press/2008/theora-release-1.0/">Theora 1.0</a>, the open source, royalty free, lossy video encoding format.</p>
<p>As a free video format, Mozilla and Opera have both announced that next releases of Firefox and Opera will support it out of the box. <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/10/firefox-31-beta-1-released-and-reviewed/">Firefox 3.1 beta 1</a>, released a few weeks ago already include a Theora decoder and can be used to watch video in a handful of sites including Wikipedia and <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/10/firefox-31-beta-1-released-and-reviewed/">TinyVid.tv</a>.<span id="more-2728"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Theora 1.0 package includes a reference library using the revised 3-clause BSD license, allowing use in all software, free or proprietary.  The reference library uses a new decoder which supports the entire Theora specification and is significantly faster than earlier versions.  This high-performance decoder is already used on the XO laptop from the OLPC project.</p>
<p>The package also supplies numerous resources for developers: a 190 page format specification, API documentation, example encoder and decoder software, and a draft RTP specification for real-time streaming.</p>
<p>Theora development does not stop with the 1.0 release.  With sponsorship from Red Hat Inc., Xiph.Org has been working on a next-generation encoder, codenamed &#8216;Thusnelda&#8217;, which has already demonstrated substantial quality improvements without breaking backward compatibility.  While Theora is already the preferred format for applications where freedom, CPU consumption, and cost are important, Thusnelda will make Theora more attractive for applications where quality and bit-rate are the only considerations.  The new encoder is slated for inclusion in the upcoming 1.1 release of Theora.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out the Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora">Theora</a> to learn more about it and its interesting origins as a proprietary format.</p>
