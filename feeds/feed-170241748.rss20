			<![CDATA[<p>I thought it was about time I mention that I&#8217;m also posting bits and pieces over on <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. It&#8217;s a great little service &ndash; not just for posting quick items, but also in the way that the Dashboard view provides a nice alternative to an RSS reader for following what friends/peers/heroes have posted. If you&#8217;re on Tumblr yourself, then hook a brother up and <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">follow me</a>!

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>This app is now available on the official Apple App Store, and has been renamed to <strong>Mobile Fotos</strong>. For newer screenshots take a look in the App Store through iTunes. I am not sure that the older version for jailbroken phones is still available, so if you are running the 2.0 iPhone software you can grab it from there.</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a clean, efficient way to browse your Flickr photos on the iPhone, there&#8217;s a new app currently in development that you are going to LOVE. Over the last week or so I&#8217;ve been testing out Mobile Flickr, a new application from Karl von Randow (of <a href="http://xk72.com/charles/">Charles</a> fame). It&#8217;s perfectly suited to the way I want to browse my online photos with the iPhone &ndash; it uses a standard iPhone-style interface, doesn&#8217;t add unnecessary clutter, is quicker than having to load the whole Flickr site in Safari, and makes great use of the built-in rotate functions and CoverFlow-style browsing.</p>
<p><img src="http://sneak.co.nz/img-large/images/posts/mobile-flickr-menu.jpg" alt="Mobile Flickr menu" /></p>
<p><img src="http://sneak.co.nz/img-large/images/posts/mobile-flickr-thumbs.jpg" alt="Mobile Flickr thumbs" /></p>
<p>Clicking a thumbnail opens the larger image on its own, rotating it to match the orientation of your phone, and uses the standard pinch/stretch methods for zooming. Of course, no application that features browsing of any kind would be complete without a little CoverFlow action thrown in for good measure:</p>
<p><img src="http://sneak.co.nz/img-large/images/posts/mobile-flickr-coverflow.jpg" alt="Mobile Flickr coverflow" /></p>
<p>It allows you to browse both your own photos, and those of your contacts (see below), plus you can also search all of Flickr or filter by most recent or &#8216;Interesting&#8217; photos.</p>
<p><img src="http://sneak.co.nz/img-large/images/posts/mobile-flickr-contacts.jpg" alt="Mobile Flickr contacts" /></p>
<p>There are still a few things to be completed (the About page states it is a &#8220;work in progress&#8221;), but so far I&#8217;m really liking it. If you want to try it out in its current state then go to Installer, add <strong>i.xk72.com</strong> to your sources, and install it from there. With the iPhone SDK just around the corner I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be too long before a version will be available for those without jailbroken phones too.</p>
<p>If you do try it, let me know how you get on :)

			<![CDATA[<p>Ever had the urge to create a mashup between your digital camera and an analogue camera? I always dreamed of a day when I could get all the benefits of digital, but use the lens from my Lomo. Turns out that Jeff from <a href="http://sushicam.com" title="Sushicam">Sushicam</a> has already done just that (read <a href="http://sushicam.com/?p=43">part 1</a> and <a href="http://sushicam.com/?p=45">part 2</a>), working out a method of mounting the lens from a defunct Lomo to an Epson rangefinder. And if Holga is your thing, Joachim Guanzon has achieved a similar feat by <a href="http://www.howcast.com/guides/1504-How-To-Make-Your-Holga-Lens-Mountable-To-Your-SLR-Camera-EOSNikonSony-ETC">mounting a Holga lens to his Canon EOS</a>.

<p>I love vinyl. I love the sound, I love the large cover art, and I love the tactile nature of handling and playing it. The one thing that stopped me from buying vinyl over the last few years (aside from no space in the apartment for turntables) is that I always want a digital copy of my music for the iPhone/iPod, and transferring from vinyl to digital is a royal pain. So you can imagine my joy when I decided to pick up some new vinyl and found that a number of new releases now come with <strong>free MP3 downloads or CDs</strong> bundled with them.</p>
<p>This is a great move on the part of the labels willing to do it, and shows that they have actually taken some steps to help music lovers. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t seem to be too widespread yet (I saw it on at least three new albums I was looking at, but many more were without). I imagine over time this will become standard practice though.</p>
<p>The other great thing is the price &ndash; the album was the same price as a regular CD, but in some sense you are getting two for the price of one. I noticed though that albums supplying extra CD&#8217;s packaged with them did cost a little more, but that&#8217;s a price I&#8217;d be willing to pay if it meant that I had the vinyl I love plus the convenience of CD for the car and to put on my iPod.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read about an upward trend in people buying vinyl over the last few years, and maybe this will help turn even more people onto it.</p>
<p>Excuse me, I have to go turn my record over&#8230;
