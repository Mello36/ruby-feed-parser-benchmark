			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="result_box" dir="ltr">PC World &#8211;<br />
Recognize this: You said that your boss you need ultraportable laptop, because it gives you an easy and instant access to your work data. But the truth is, the main reason people bought a smooth, Slim ultraportable is to turn heads. HP Voodoo Envy 133 is one of those brilliant new toys, in particular, just to legitimize it as a slick business field as well. Like the Apple MacBook Air, the envy of 133 sports quite an interesting design choice to be a real attention-getter. But unfortunately, she also shared the air in the intestines and anemic higher price tag.</p>
<p>While Apple in thin and light slightly curvy, well-rounded, 133 Envy is a boxy - even with its glossy shine, he was still sexy. This notebook Voodoo measures 12.7 by 9 by 0.8 inches (close air line), and it weighs 3.5 pounds without his incredibly unique power brick, which I will go more in the near future.</p>
<p>What do I need to address first, though the systems are smaller than the early components.</p>
<p>For starters, NV4040NA model we tested (configuration HP said that is suitable for road warriors) is the Intel Core 2 Duo 1,6 GHz CPU (SP7500), 2GB of RAM, as well as close 80GB hard drive, back to 4200. / Min. You probably will not be shocked to learn that the system is not exactly sail through WorldBench 6. She received a total score 64, and he ran a single-digit slide show in Doom 3 (7 frames per second at 1024-by-768 pixels resolution). Nobody will mistake this Voodoo field for the game machine.</p>
<p>And while Envy 133 does not have the worst battery, the results of our tests were far from the best: a period of 2 hours, 39 minutes, he ran slightly longer than the MacBook Air, but fell far behind almost everything else we &#8216;ve seen. (For comparison, , Lenovo ThinkPad X200 rules roost with a staggering lasted 8 hours, 54 minutes. And sex Samsung X360 hung for 7 hours, 36 min.) On average, we test notebooks can run about 4.5 hours.</p>
<p>Innovative design choice</p>
<p>Thus, in carrying out these attacks against HP Voodoo Envy 133, why would anyone in their right mind seen falling about $ 2349 for it? Let&#8217;s look at some aspects of its design.</p>
<p>This ultraportable includes a number of truly unique ideas - things that I had never seen before - and I welcome some of them. A thin, sealed case does not allow much room, so do not try looking for a lot of material. Envy 133 has a headphone jack and a USB port, and he makes a few nods to the high end with HDMI-and shared eSATA / USB-port. One interesting choice: a slot-loading an external optical drive, which sells this unit plugs with eSATA-cable.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="result_box" dir="ltr">SAN FRANCISCO - Fourteen of the world&#8217;s largest mobile phone and chip bodies, including Sony Ericsson, Vodafone Group Plc and ARM Holdings Plc, joined by the Open Mobile Alliance on Tuesday in support of Android mobile platform developed by Google Inc</p>
<p>New parties &#8220;undertake to return Android software is a significant achievement for Google in the mobile phone industry, as well as its T-Mobile G1 phone takes on rival Apple Inc in the popular iPhone 3G.</p>
<p>But despite the great name of additions to the Open Mobile Alliance, analysts said that the question of whether the new members to provide more support Android smartphones in 2009 and 2010 to crowd out competitors who also use open-source Linux software for mobile phones, such as Nokia of smartphone software manufacturer Symbian.</p>
<p>History continues below</p>
<p>Advertising | Your ad here</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great that these people are on board &#8230; now (Open Mobile Alliance) must be satisfied that these licenses actually ship products,&#8221; said research firm Jupitermedia vice president of wireless strategy, Michael Gartenberg.</p>
<p>The first company to provide wireless device that uses an operating system Android is Sony Ericsson, a joint venture Japan&#8217;s Sony Corp and Swedish Ericsson. The company said on Tuesday he plans to submit Android, supported by a mobile phone in mid-2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;Android is set to become a significant application framework for mobile phones&#8221; Ericsson&#8217;s head of mobile platforms, Robert Puskaric, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Phone open alliance said on Tuesday that each of its members commits to develop applications and services for mobile phones and phones using the platform Android and Android-compatible mobile devices.</p>
<p>Taiwan ASUSTeK Computer Inc, Toshiba Corp and Garmin Ltd also expressed their support, bringing the total number of companies in the open mobile alliance to 47, the Alliance said. These companies join previous members of the Alliance, such as the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of chips Intel Corp and mobile phones Motorola Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Both Google and Apple have wooed developers to create applications for mobile devices, but Apple maintains tight control over iPhone hardware and operating software. Companies Google Android is open to changes in external developers.</p>
<p>In addition to the new members of the Alliance Open makes phone for Google Android more advanced weight in the battle over who will dominate the mobile phone software market in the coming years. Android biggest rival Symbian, which controls half of the market and was purchased by Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of mobile phones, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Nokia promotes Symbian assets are not for profit organization, by analogy with an open phone Alliance, Symbian Fund. Members Symbian Foundation grant access to the Symbian software.</p>
<p>To date, 59 companies have said they plan to merge Symbian Fund, including Japan&#8217;s third-largest wireless operator, Softbank.</p>
<p>Android also competes with Microsoft in the Windows Mobile operating system, which is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>In terms of companies jumping in the alliance, such as portable navigation device maker Garmin Ltd, Android has the potential to describe the devices other than mobile phones. Every mobile phone can also modify Android open source, which leaves open the possibility for many future mobile phones.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s fascinating about Android, it is plastic thing. Since these phones come from other carriers, it looks and operates differently,&#8221; said Greg Sterling, a Web analyst Sterling market. He added that &#8220;it seems, more people will move from winning.&#8221;</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="result_box" dir="ltr">Technology holiday gift checklist: LCD TV - Maybe. The new BlackBerry or iPhone - as possible. E-Reader - Are you kidding?</p>
<p>No, not kidding. Although they are unlikely to be high on many lists of customers, Sony has recently e-reader, PRS-700, and Amazon in one of more than a year, are beginning to generate interest. Whether they will generate sales remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Their relatively high price - $ 399,99 for Sony and $ 359 for one - will not help none in the season frugality. But for those who are voracious reader books, travelers and students of the &#8220;costs may be offset by their ability to ease the schlep load and save money on buying books.</p>
<p>History continues below</p>
<p>Advertising | Your ad here</p>
<p>The New York Times best selling books in general pp cost $ 9.99 for one and $ 11.99 in electronic books in the Sony store. And the price is considerably lower than the printed version.</p>
<p>It is easier on the eyes<br />
Both Sony Reader digital books, as it is called, and whose use of technology called E-Pen. It helps digital pages look real, and easier on the eye for longer periods of reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us can read a short files and e-mail on our BlackBerrys and our computers,&#8221; said Brennan Mullin, Sony Electronics vice-president of audio. &#8220;But when you read a novel or reading research papers and sat down for one or two hours, the experience of these devices are great, the battery is limited, and it is difficult for the eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are some of the reasons for devices like smart phones, iPods and portable game players may not be the best options for reading books, although they certainly can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mobile phone screens, of course, get more, and may become more fit for short-form content in the near future, such as magazine features of blogs,&#8221; said Ross Rubin, director of industry analysis for NPD Group market research firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sony Reader and Amazon strike certainly made progress. But there will be limited to specifically market the device that reads the book, simply because a relatively small percentage of the U.S. population are avid readers enough to justify buying such a device, even if prices come down, which they will continue to do. &#8221;</p>
<p>For e-readers to become &#8220;mass market item, prices should be declining, and they will&#8221; be taken by education market &#8220;to succeed, he believes.</p>
<p>Some of that is beginning to happen. Sony said the book can now be downloaded to its readers of some public libraries across the country. And this fall, the company donated 100 of its readers at the University of Pennsylvania in libraries to see how students use the devices for research projects, as well as employment and leisure reading.</p>
<p>Differences between Sony, Amazon<br />
Amazon, which continuously releases statistics on all of them to buy what and when - before the hour - not publicly shared information about one&#8217;s selling.</p>
<p>The company noted that it recently sold to ignite, due to heavy customer demand &#8220;and said the orders now will not be delivered until after Christmas.</p>
<p>Research firm iSuppli said earlier this year that the strike and Sony readers have &#8220;proved there is a viable market for electronic books, with the supply of all e-books are expected to reach 1 million units in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible that Amazon in the strike and Sony Reader can be done to ensure that electronic books from the Apple iPod did for MP3 players,&#8221; said Vinita Jakhanwal, principal analyst for mobile displays at iSuppli, said in the report.</p>
<p>Sony first digital reader was released in Japan and then in the United States in 2006. The company has another reader, PRS-505, which retails for $ 299.</p>
<p>Sony<br />
Digital Book Reader (PRS-700) from Sony is $ 399.99. He has a 6-inch display for touch screens and can store about 350 books.<br />
One of the main differences between him and the new model, PRS-700, is that the PRS-700 is used for touch screens, and readers can stay, annotate and search for words in books.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Sony and incite readers in the book is how to get to these devices.</p>
<p>Kindle uses wireless communication over the Sprint phone data network to deliver books on the device, so it can be done from almost anywhere in the country, except in Montana and Alaska. No computer is necessary, and there is no additional fee.</p>
<p>Sony for readers to download books to your PC. Sony Reader comes with a USB cable that connects to a PC for the transfer of books on the device.</p>
<p>Both Sony and stir up readers rather easily, ranging in age from 10 to 11 ounces, and 6-inch display screens, adjustable font size and long battery lasting a week or more (less time to ignite, if you&#8217;re using a wireless connection is often).</p>

<p>One ignite in draws is that customers can get discounts on suscriptions for newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times, Newsweek and Time.</p>
<p>So far, Amazon has more than 190,000 books to incite; Sony in the e-book store in the 57000, with more than 100,000 expected by the end of this year, said the representative. She added that Reader users can also buy and download books from the &#8220;many places&#8221; as free and paid, including Manybooks.net, Gutenberg.com and Fictionwise.com.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The real name of this article, it came from the mailbox: rotten Pile of shit, sorry I had to change it so that would tell the news Google. - Wil </p>
<p>Gory greetings horroryearbook graduates! Welcome to another edition of interesting He came from the mailbox, the column where your old pal Brain Hammer album regardless of random shit good people at horroryearbook decide to send my way. </p>
<p>Shit is the key word at this time. I was glad to see the package in my mailbox from Molly Celaschi beautiful, but my excitement quickly turned into fear and disgust when I opened the package and found haggard outlook range of DVD-R&#8217;s. Ah yes, home of horror. Apparently this was my specialty. Only one of the people involved was clever to include any details about his film. (Try to guess which one) The remainder of those included Jokers or simply a film or a tiny piece of scrap paper full misspelled words, punctuation and mangled NO CONTACT INFORMATION FOR ALL, except to ask for &#8220;e-mail me when when the review done.&#8221; Yes, I will get right on that, guys. </p>
<p>And anyway, our night of horror began with the EAT ME, 10-minute short film written and directed by Victor Bonacore. It employs about 9 minutes too long, and tells tales that the couple get attacked by zombies turn into zombies themselves, and then eat each other. I thought it looked like crap, and it was almost unwatchable, thanks annoying folk music that was used as the score. The only attention has been impressive rooster is the method of lead actress. She swallowed a lot of that fake cock, before leaving his bite, and I should give her some props for that. </p>
<p>Next to (s) hit list was CANNIBAL CHEERLEADER camp. This 18 minute short film that was shot in one week last October in Virginia Winchester on MiniDV, using Panasonic DVX-100B, with a budget of $ 700. Writer and director Paul Busetti argues that the film was his attempt to &#8220;squeeze all the high notes in the genre of short film, without losing any tension or suspense.&#8221; Apparently, he believes that high note genre is a pile of oil facing skanks taking a shower and then get dismembered. I hope he does not spend more than $ 20 budget for these chickens to be in the movie, because they were all shitty actresses, and none of them were hot. I have never seen a less attractive lesbian shower scenes in all my days. I had a hard time after what should have been happening in this, but ultimately all pasty faced skanks were killed and 18 minutes of tension and suspense (the slow torture), happily ceased. </p>
<p>Director Craig McIntyre&#8217;s A FEW LOOSE screws Flick, I was next to (h) through. I was cringing when I popped this in the DVD-player because of the particularly sad promising DVD-R cover, which looked like it was drawn to the hands of a small child with cerebral palsy. Then the parade of extremely promising slutty chicks began parading in front of the camera and my Dick &#8230; I mean my view, started to pay attention. It was a full length movie about the assassination of porn director, who slaughters sluts, which appear in his films. There is something like a plot south of computers, who beat out constantly and works in fast-food restaurant, but I have a lot of tuned each time wasn&#8217;ta half-naked chick to look at. The best that I can say about this one is that some really hot chicks in it. I especially like the Asian chick with braces and jungle skank with pierced nipples, who prances around in the Ramones T-shirt torn. There are oodles of prospective laughably fake blood and guts, but after about the fifteenth stage in a row, where some TWAT gets tortured and torn apart, I was looking for the remote control. Unfortunately, this was the best of the bunch Flick time. </p>
<p>I saved the worst for last. Phil German and Fvideo (F must stand for its failure) to submit to the forest, a fairy tale about a stone face pigs woman who goes surfing, goes home and watches film of horror, and then gets naked and goes to sleep. As she sleeps maniac attacked her and then kidnaps her. She wakes up naked in the cabin in the middle of the forest. Then comes the real horror: it was his clothes and went home without incident. To fuck why I watch it?? Eventually, some bald dipshit rape her, chicken commit suicide, bald dipshit commit suicide, and some other skank wakes up naked in the forest. It&#8217;s quite a lot of it. What is a devil movie. Half of the hour long exercise in abject boredom consists of scenes people talked on the phone. A scene of rape has been promising ludicrous and suicides have been miserable. It looked like they were throwing around some Ragu and called it day. Obviously Phil is a great rush to his movies reviewed, and I hope that I have made my day a little brighter, by doing this. He was pleased enough to say he &#8220;hopes you&#8217;ll like this as we have done that,&#8221; apparently because they were a hell of a miserable time. This was absolute crap. </p>
<p>I am going to seek refuge in some of the larger budget, slick and glossy Hollywood horror of the actual cost of production, creativity and talent. If someone wants to send me booze and hard drugs, to help me forget about these films, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
