I was on Facebook a little bit ago, wasting time that could have been spent on coding or something, and I came across this ad, pictured at left. Does anything about it look vaguely familiar?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yep, that’s right, it’s from Halo 3. Need a closer look? try this on for size:&lt;img style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://f.chtah.com/i/41/633888998/X0516Halo3Announce_topImage.jpg" width="240" height="179" alt="" /&gt;I’d even be willing to bet that the image I’m linking to is the exact one they used to make their ad. Note the bottom is cut off past the point where the spires start to come out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I’m no attorney, but I’m pretty sure this image is Microsoft’s intellectual property. Somehow I doubt they’d be very happy with this, if only I could figure out who is doing the advertising (I flagged the ad on Facebook before I clicked the link, stupid, I know).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46566" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description></item><item><title>Clearing Up Misinformation About the Leaked Windows 7 Build</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/clearing-up-misinformation-about-the-leaked-windows-7-build.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 21:32:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46562</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to see more and more chatter about the Windows 7 build that was “leaked” (I would say stolen) from WinHEC China. I can already see the beginnings of the misinformation campaign that damaged Windows Vista in the Court of Public Opinion, so I’m going to nip some things in the bud right here (because Microsoft isn’t going to do it). You can take what I have to say as the truth, because unlike some others reporting on second- or third-hand information, I am actually running the build on my day-to-day laptop. This is not likely to endear me to any of Team Sinofsky, but I’d rather get in trouble with Microsoft than let false information float around.&lt;a href="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/Start-Menu-Settings_5F00_01ABF31D.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;margin:0px 0px 0px 5px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;" title="Start Menu Settings" border="0" alt="Start Menu Settings" align="right" src="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/Start-Menu-Settings_5F00_thumb_5F00_20EE99F0.png" width="207" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Nobody is getting a Windows 7 build tomorrow at the Houston MDC. &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/keithcombs/archive/2008/12/02/i-know-where-you-can-get-windows-7-beta-1-dvd-s-shhhhh.aspx"&gt;Keith Combs cleared this up last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oDvY1-XeY"&gt;This video of the new bootscreen&lt;/a&gt; is not a fabrication, it is real. The quality of the video sucks, but in person the animation is really cool. &lt;a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2008/12/05/windows-7-to-be-first-windows-to-report-real-boot-progress/"&gt;Rafael has an interesting analysis of how it works&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;There are other screenshots floating around out there, in varying degrees of quality and OS default settings. &lt;a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/win7/win7_m3_69xx.asp"&gt;Paul Thurrott has the only ones you should trust&lt;/a&gt;, with the default post-install experience. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Again, in some screenshots, there are &lt;a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/images/win7/win7_69xx_003.jpg"&gt;images of windows with transparent side chrome&lt;/a&gt;. Some are saying that, because the build originally got out in VHD form, that the build must be using &lt;a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20081126/direct3d-warp10-to-enable-you-to-play-dx10-crysis-using-software-renderer-only-albeit-slowly/"&gt;DXWARP10 that Long talked about last week&lt;/a&gt;. While I cannot say whether or not DXWARP10 is in this build, any purported tying of DXWARP10 and Microsoft’s virtualization technologies should be treated as speculation. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The SuperBar has not been “&lt;a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Leaks_indicate_Microsoft_is_unrethinking_the_Win7_taskbar/1228780333"&gt;un-rethought&lt;/a&gt;” or “un-redesigned” in any way. The default SuperBar settings are as shown in Paul’s Screenshots, and have not changed. However, there are settings that were available to anyone using &lt;a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2008/12/09/blue-badge-rev-3-adds-registry-override-bits-aero-peek-enabled/"&gt;Rafael’s Blue Badge&lt;/a&gt; tool that let you control whether or not the SuperBar renders text or not. A screenshot of that dialog is a right. if you check “Use Small Icons” and select “Never Combine” from the group, the newest build’s Taskbar displays like this:       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/Small-Start-Menu_5F00_0E39A039.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px;" title="Small Start Menu" border="0" alt="Small Start Menu" src="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/Small-Start-Menu_5F00_thumb_5F00_0DCD6D44.png" width="604" height="33" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;(the icons interspersed in between are the pinned programs in their original organization. And unlike Windows Vista, you can drag and reorganize the taskbar items in this state.) Microsoft has previously stated that the old Taskbar would not be available in Windows 7, so I’m not sure if the feature and rendering depicted above are going to remain. But if I were Microsoft, I’d leave it alone. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would ask that bloggers and the press be responsible in their reporting and observations, and clearly identify the facts they are reporting from their guesstimates and speculation. Windows Vista’s reputation was damaged just as much by it’s own initial issues as it was by individuals people trust relaying unsubstantiated rumors, speculation based on partial facts, and outright lies. in other words, don’t tell us what is in a particular Windows 7 build unless you have been in the immediate presence of a machine running it, mmmkay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46562" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+7/default.aspx">Windows 7</category></item><item><title>Looks Like The Pentagon Should Have Been Running Windows Vista</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/looks-like-the-pentagon-should-have-been-running-windows-vista.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2008 06:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46539</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>8</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;The US government has been &lt;a href="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2007/03/14/government-agencies-ban-windows-vista"&gt;leery of upgrading to Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt;.

I don’t necessarily want to say anything that has an affect on the outcome one way or another, and I didn’t know what was true and what wasn’t. But after &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2008403670_microsoft18.html"&gt;the e-mails that were released last week&lt;/a&gt;, some of the rumors were confirmed, and some things I had heard rumblings about started to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that I think it is total BS that any Windows executive had anything to do with the nitty-gritty on whether one particular feature made it into Vista vs. another. It should not have been Will Poole’s call by any means that the WDDM requirement was dropped. I’m also very glad that Jim Allchin had nothing to do with it. He stayed true to the product no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Midmorning on the 30th, Mike Ybarra, a product manager, sent a message marked &amp;quot;urgent due to customer satisfaction escalation&amp;quot; to then-Windows boss Jim Allchin and Will Poole, then in charge of the Windows Client Business.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Poole was the one who ultimately made the decision to drop the WDDM requirement.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In an August 2005 meeting, &amp;quot;you both committed to HP that we would not move off the WDDM requirement and HP made significant product roadmap changes to support graphics for the full experience,&amp;quot; Ybarra wrote, adding that an HP executive committed to investing in graphics &amp;quot;if MS would give him 100% assurance that we would not budge for Intel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By noon, anger from HP was reaching Microsoft, which had planned to communicate its changes the next day. Poole wrote to Ybarra and Allchin at 12:16 p.m.: &amp;quot;Intel leaked this despite my explicit agreement with [an Intel senior vice president] that we would communicate together.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The WDDM change, apparently too late to reverse, seemed to take Allchin by surprise. &amp;quot;I knew nothing about this,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;Will, you need to explain. I don&amp;#39;t even understand what this means. ... &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And now I know why Sinofsky has delegated more authority down to the feature teams when it comes to what features will be shipping with Windows 7. It might have been just as much about saving his own butt as anything else, but it was a smart decision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity earlier this year to ask some HP employees (including an executive) about why HP was shipping laptops that were so imbalanced on the Windows Experience Index. No sooner had those words left my mouth than I felt like I had just swore in front of my mother for the first time. I was met with stonefaced silence, then anger. The executive didn’t even answer my question, leaving a colleague to explain to me that “Microsoft gamed the WinSAT rating for Intel.” I was shocked. For the next 5 minutes, he explained what happened, and I was dumbfounded. I knew that the WinSAT team spent a lot of time trying to get the experience and algorithms right, so the decision had to have come from higher up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But now I know why there was so much animosity about the whole thing. This is yet another reason why OEMs had no confidence in Microsoft’s ability to deliver with Vista, because requirements were changing all the time. HP had every right to be pissed about it, Microsoft had no right to move the goalposts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope Will Poole is held personally responsible for this. His damage to the Windows brand is without measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46536" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+Vista/default.aspx">Windows Vista</category></item><item><title>Microsoft To Replace OneCare With New Free Solution… And a Win7 Hint?</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/microsoft-to-replace-onecare-with-new-free-solution-and-possible-win7-street-date-hint.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2008 03:49:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46533</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft just sucker-punched McAfee and Symantec right in the stones today with &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/nov08/11-18NoCostSecurityPR.mspx"&gt;a carefully-worded press release&lt;/a&gt; about the future of Windows Security. In a move I’ve been anticipating since the inclusion of Windows Defender into Windows Vista, Microsoft has made it clear, on no uncertain terms, that it is taking full responsibility for the security of the operating system. There are currently few solutions that offer affordable solutions for PCs in emerging markets, where bandwidth may be low, or the PCs may be closer to Netbooks in power. When you only have a GB or less of RAM, every megabyte counts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Microsoft basically just told the major players in the antivirus industry to eff-off, and will be offering a new security product, codename “Morro”, on or near June 30, 2009. This product is apparently based off of Microsoft’s ForeFront offering. Now, that date is interesting for a couple reasons. One is because it is the last day of Microsoft’s fiscal year, and it’s also the beginning of the second half of 2009, which is around the time when Microsoft is supposedly shipping Windows 7. Could Microsoft be looking to launch Windows 7 on June 30th? IMHO it’s starting to look that way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not a betting man. But if I were a betting man, I would bet on the following things happening:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;“Morro” will be released in conjunction with Windows 7 (meaning on the same day).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Windows 7 will have download links for the new service built into the OS (just like Windows Live).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Symantec is going to scream bloody murder.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the last point, I happen to agree with Charles Cooper that &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10787_3-10101676-60.html"&gt;there aren’t really antitrust concerns here&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10101652-56.html"&gt;as his colleague Ina Fried suggests&lt;/a&gt;, it’s bound to come up. One thing I find odd is that &lt;a href="http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/3/smallbusiness/default.htm"&gt;OneCare for Server&lt;/a&gt; is less than a week old, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1729"&gt;as Mary Jo noted&lt;/a&gt;, is now also dead too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I for one think it’s great that Microsoft is going to put its resources into a best-of-breed solution for malware, instead of all the other ancillary nonsense.&amp;#160; With Skydrive, Live Sync, Live Photos, Live Mesh, and WHS, Microsoft has the backup playing field covered. With Windows 7, HomeGroups have the file and printer sharing stuff covered, so there is no need to duplicate this stuff in other ways. The new Windows mantra is “&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/15/engineering-7-a-view-from-the-bottom.aspx"&gt;Cutting Is Shipping&lt;/a&gt;”, and I for one am glad that Microsoft is starting to trim the fat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And to all the other antivirus vendors, take note: there will still be ways to innovate against this new offering. Spend your time trying to figure them out instead of whining about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46533" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+7/default.aspx">Windows 7</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+Live+OneCare/default.aspx">Windows Live OneCare</category></item><item><title>Windows Mobile Confusion</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/windows-mobile-confusion.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2008 03:50:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46523</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;First, we were told that &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1052"&gt;Windows Mobile 7&lt;/a&gt; would succeed Windows Mobile 6.

IMHO, this is a terrible idea. As &lt;a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2008/11/youtube-video-problems.html"&gt;Dan Rayburn&lt;/a&gt; pointed out just two days ago, Google has not been able to improve the basic underlying infrastructure of the service since they acquired the company two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I was watching a History Channel documentary that someone uploaded to YouTube, and I constantly had to wait for the thing to buffer. It was driving me crazy. That’s because YouTube is not a streaming service, it’s a progressive file download. They don’t use Flash Media Server, they don’t use a CDN, and apparently they don’t care about the user experience, either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So why would Google want to exponentially exacerbate the situation by adding content that’s 10x as long to their network?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And how would Google prevent the underlying Flash video from being saved and used for other purposes? I know there are several browser add-ons that can save Flash video, and specifically YouTube videos, so how would Google get around this?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, it just seems pointless, because without an infrastructure update, there is no way Google can out-Hulu Hulu… they just have a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46509" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mr. Ballmer, Please Do Not Bailout Yahoo</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/mr-ballmer-please-do-not-bailout-yahoo.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2008 21:17:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46506</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>5</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;An Open Letter to Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Ballmer,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Congratulations on all the product launches your company has undertaken in the last two weeks. Microsoft is in the midst of rolling out it’s greatest slate of software in its history, and all of your employees need to keep their eyes on the ball to bring this exciting stable of software to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yahoo, on the other hand, is a terribly-managed company, with their Chief Yahoo really living up to his name. They have no direction, no focus, no goals, and their stock price is in the crapper. They don’t use any Microsoft technologies in their operation (save for running Windows on their desktops) and they &lt;a href="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/yahoo-dumps-wpf-chat-client.aspx"&gt;just ditched the only effort&lt;/a&gt; to develop on a Microsoft platform that they’ve undertaken in a long time. They may be a great Windows customer, but that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just because Microsoft earns more than a year than many countries, does not mean that you should get in the business of bailing out failing companies. Apparently, that is Congress’ job. The only thing that could possibly be valuable to you is their server infrastructure, and there are cheaper ways to buy hardware.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Ballmer, Yahoo is a dying company. Let capitalism take its course.

A week ago today, the company began to roll out the first fruits of nearly three years of silent toiling, to near universally positive reviews by most of the tech press. A week later, many of us are still trying to get our heads around a very blue future, and what Azure means for the state of computing. &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/author/steve/"&gt;Steve Gillmor&lt;/a&gt; has a wonderful write-up entitled “The Battle for Microsoft’s Soul”, and even goes so far as to suggest that the timing of this event is perfect, as the tech industry is looking for new platforms to build grand ideas on in these tough economic times.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We’re looking at the next Outlook, and it’s going to be hard to stop inside Microsoft’s executive war room. The biggest single sound we heard at the Azure rollout was that of silence - a three year incubation period where very little of what Ray Ozzie has been building leaked out, and that which did was couched in terms that gave the old guard little to attack or slow down. Now that it’s here and endorsed by Ballmer in such unequivocal terms, the war for Microsoft’s soul is over. By opening the platform to &lt;a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/10/31/uri-xml-http-rest-and-the-azure-services-platform/"&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; forged in large part by scripters, hackers, and especially competitors, Microsoft has leapfrogged into the lead for mindshare where it counts: inside the company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/11/02/the-battle-for-microsofts-soul/"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46502" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enable The SuperBar in Windows 7 Pre-Beta!</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/enable-the-superbar-in-the-windows-7-prebeta.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2008 01:05:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46501</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the big disappointments of the Pre-Beta build was the lack of the New Taskbar, which is referred to internally as the SuperBar.

He dismissed it, but luckily he stumbled on it anyways. It turns out, Microsoft protected the feature to the internal corporate network, but Explorer bypasses the check if it finds a cached result. Raph figured out how to cache the result, and whamo!

That may be based on earlier (limited) explanations about what it does, or it may have a lot to do with people assuming, due to people’s efforts with open source software, that rewriting the kernel will solve all of Windows problems. Well, Mark Russinovich, Microsoft Technical Fellow and guru of all things NT Kernel, attempts to set the record straight in &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Mark-Russinovich-Inside-Windows-7/"&gt;this 45 minute video from Channel 9&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the whole talk is about advancements in Windows 7, and has great info about the new event-based model for Windows Services (dunno what took so long on that one, but I’m glad its there now), and other things. but for the purposes of this discussion, you want to jump in at 28:20, which is where MinWin first comes up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m going to attempt to use my Geek-to-Layman Translator to break down what Mark said:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It turns out that Windows Server Core is not a clean separation of the true core of Windows. When Microsoft first set out to make Server Core, they discovered that lower-level systems were dependent on some higher-level calls, which is a no-no in systems design. When they looked deeper, they found out this was happening all over the place. They realized it was going to take too much effort to make a clean break for Server Core, so they literally ripped out anything that wasn’t necessary for the Server Roles they wanted to support. That’s why you’re not supposed to run any other apps on Server Core (or WinPE, as it turns out) because it might make a call to something that doesn’t exist, and it will fail. If it fails low enough, well, that could be bad for the OS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That system is not scalable or testable in any way, and makes it very difficult to innovatively deliver future iterations of Server Core. So Microsoft started to chart out the entire Windows dependency graph. And as they saw things that started calling up the stack when they weren’t supposed to, they rearranged the APIs to create a clean separation in the OS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MinWin is the result of that work. It is not a complete rewrite of the kernel, but a reorganization of the APIs, so that components only call &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; the stack, and not up it. It is isolated in the build tree from the rest of Windows, so it can be innovated on by itself. It is fully bootable, 25-40MB of disk space, and contains the executive systems, memory management, networking, and optional file system drivers. It’s fully testable, and Microsoft is working on a large suite of test cases to run against it. And it *is* indeed in Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mark also said that, though MinWin is finished, their work in this process is not. Now they’ve gone up in the stack, and are looking at where the next boundary needs to be drawn. Apparently, it is part of a much larger effort to reorganize all of the Windows codebase, and keep things clean and separate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As an aside, for those of you wondering, a lot of the MinWin magic happens in KernelBase.dll. It contains a lot of the functionality that was refactored from Kernel32.dll, so for compatibility with older programs, they left “forwarders” in there that pass the calls down to KernelBase.dll as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So rejoice, armchair kernel enthusiasts! Microsoft is tidying house inside “Cutler’s NT”, and Windows 7 is the next step (the first being the componentization work from Windows Vista) in the massive decade-long operation to optimize and refactor the Windows codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46494" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+Server+Core/default.aspx">Windows Server Core</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+7/default.aspx">Windows 7</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+Server+2008+SP2/default.aspx">Windows Server 2008 SP2</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/MinWin/default.aspx">MinWin</category></item><item><title>Live Mesh Offline For Beta Upgrade</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/live-mesh-offline-for-beta-upgrade.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2008 17:56:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46492</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;I was updating my Mesh a minute ago, and was greeted with this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/LiveMesh_5F00_3A8A55FB.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px;" title="LiveMesh" border="0" alt="LiveMesh" src="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/LiveMesh_5F00_thumb_5F00_002EE01A.jpg" width="476" height="209" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope that means the Windows Mobile client is coming today!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Update:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Looks like &lt;a href="http://www.liveside.net/main/archive/2008/10/30/live-mesh-updating-has-begun.aspx"&gt;LiveSide&lt;/a&gt; beat me too it.

On a % of sales basis, Microsoft spends 4.2x more per dollar earned than Apple.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Apple spends 1.7x as much per dollar on R&amp;amp;D than it does on advertising. Microsoft spends 5.2x per dollar on R&amp;amp;D than it does on advertising.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Put another way, Microsoft spends nearly as much in R&amp;amp;D &lt;em&gt;per year&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt; of Apple net profits.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The old saying goes, “If you point a finger at someone,there will be three pointing back at you.” I guess in Apple’s case, there are 4.2 fingers pointing back at them.

I didn’t know what to expect, and I walked away with the feeling I got after seeing Longhorn for the first time. yes, I believe it was just that good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it Stable?&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;This is the #1 question I get when I talk about this build. And I’m happy to report, the answer is a resounding “Yes!” if you have not read &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/15/engineering-7-a-view-from-the-bottom.aspx"&gt;Larry Osterman’s blog post over on Engineering 7&lt;/a&gt;, then you should read it, because it answers the question on how a “pre-beta” can maintain such a high quality bar. It is a *very* informative read. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about UAC?&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/UACDefault_5F00_7206CD18.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;margin:0px 0px 0px 5px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px;" title="UACDefault" border="0" alt="UACDefault" align="right" src="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/UACDefault_5F00_thumb_5F00_32E59CBD.jpg" width="197" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That is the second question that people have asked thus far. The answer is, UAC has been tweaked on many fronts. You can now choose, in slider form, how much Windows 7’s UAC will interrupt you. There are now 4 options, which are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Never notify me &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Only notify me when programs try to make changes &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Always notify &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Notify and wait for my approval &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have yet to be presented with a UAC prompt in over 24 hours… which is really nice. (Update: actually, I was prompted and I didn’t even know it, because UAC no longer grays-out the desktop anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you most excited about?&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;I’m really excited about Windows 7 as a whole, but I’ll run through the features that I’ll be covering more in-depth in my review that will be posted soon:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Taskbar:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll hate it at first glance, but you’ll love it in 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HomeGroup:&lt;/strong&gt; Simplified home networking. Allows you to easily discover documents and media on other Windows 7 computers on the network.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HomeGroup in Windows Media Center:&lt;/strong&gt; SoftSled on crack.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Media Center:&lt;/strong&gt; Cleaner UI, DVD Library on by default, UI for adding Recorded TV folders.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play To:&lt;/strong&gt; Queue media on your library to play on any DLN A-compliant device in your home.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Codec Support:&lt;/strong&gt; h.264, DivX, XviD, non-FairPlay AAC.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch:&lt;/strong&gt; The new touch features are simply amazing. Take that, Apple!&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DirectConnect&lt;/strong&gt;: VPN without the VPN&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless:&lt;/strong&gt; Simplified WiFi connections, built-in mobile broadband stack, better Bluetooth pairing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a LOT more to be excited about as well. I hope you keep it here as we begin this Windows 7 journey together. Enjoy the keynote!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46473" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description></item><item><title>Windows Azure Beta Allocation Stats</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/windows-azure-beta-allocation-stats.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2008 20:16:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46471</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;I just got my invite to Windows Azure (holy crap, that was fast!) and I can now report what you’ll be allocated as a part of the service:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest in Windows© Azure™.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This invitation to participate in the Windows Azure Community Technical Preview is subject to the following usage limits:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Total compute usage: 2000 VM hours      &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Cloud storage capacity: 50GB       &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Total storage bandwidth: 20GB/day&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;During the CTP, we reserve the right to suspend your account activity (this does not imply we will delete your cloud storage) if you exceed these usage limits.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,      &lt;br /&gt;Azure Services Platform Team&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Free server space for the taking. We’re joking in the press room over here that with that kind of bandwidth, you could have a really awesome Silverlight powered Azure-based P2P movie pirating service. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition, I just found out that I can use the service to host 1 project, store data for 2 projects, and access Live Services APIs from 20 projects. It would appear that this is the new interface for managing all of your Live Services applications, not just Azure ones.

Thanks for joining me for what turned out to be an exhausting experience ;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:12am:&lt;/strong&gt; “We ourselves are betting on our own platform with our own apps. You are the first ones that are going to have access to our Azure SDK. You can register at noon today at &lt;a href="http://www.azure.com"&gt;Azure.com&lt;/a&gt;, and will be activated over the next two weeks. We will be intentionally conservative about how we roll out. Because the service may change as a direct result of your feedback, potentially incompatibly so, we will not charge for the service. When it is released in 2009, the pricing model will be very straightforward, and competitive with the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:09am:&lt;/strong&gt; Ray Ozzie is back onstage to wrap things up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:08am:&lt;/strong&gt; The guy next to me is falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:06am:&lt;/strong&gt; The demo project portal uses a very interesting gauge control to show how much money is being spent on the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:00am:&lt;/strong&gt; Demo time. The Microsoft Services Connector service is being demoed on Windows Server 2008. Lets you supply credentials and then set which users can access the services. Can be single users, OUs, or whole organizations. Check out &lt;a href="https://graphicdesign.crm.dynamics.com"&gt;https://graphicdesign.crm.dynamics.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:55am:&lt;/strong&gt; “The beauty of Software+Services is the Power of Choice. But there are tough problems to solve. One is Federated Identity, and the second is Extensibility.” two new products are mentioned, the Microsoft Services Connector (probably a server role in Windows Server 2008) and the Microsoft Federation Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:54am:&lt;/strong&gt; “In the future, &lt;strong&gt;*all*&lt;/strong&gt; of our Enterprise software will be delivered as an option through Microsoft Online Services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:53am:&lt;/strong&gt; (Did I mention that Liveblogging is tough?)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:51am:&lt;/strong&gt; Dave Thompson is now onstage, talking about “how you the developer can extend the Azure platform.” Worked on Windows Server through 2003, then Exchange 2007.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:50am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Oslo” is a new modeling platform that introduces the “M” language, and will drastically change the way services are built.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:48am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Over time, we see Azure services moving back on-presence. So we will be building some of these capabilities into Windows Server and SQL Server.” I assume they are talking about System Center-type software for internal reporting, but this seems weird to me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:46am:&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the things we want to be able to do with Atlanta is to be able to give system administrators the ability to create and run their own reports using SQL Services Reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:42am:&lt;/strong&gt; Muglia back: “Small project called ‘System Center Atlanta’ manages Windows Azure.” Check it out at &lt;a href="http://atlanta.cloudapp.net"&gt;http://atlanta.cloudapp.net&lt;/a&gt;. “We expect to get hundreds of gigabytes of information a day to help people understand how their services are running.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:40am:&lt;/strong&gt; Demoing a Silverlight console application showing interaction with SQL Services.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:38am:&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the biggest benefits to us is that companies can use their own internal identities through the federated identity model.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:37am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Think about the complexity of building an application that spans different types of heterogeneous systems, different ERP systems, different communications protocols.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:36am:&lt;/strong&gt; Shawn Davison from Red Prairie is now onstage demoing their product. “A one-button product recall application that spans multiple enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:34am:&lt;/strong&gt; SQL Services will add Sync in the future, and an early beta of Reporting Services will be released “soon”. There will also be “reference data” to be able to prototype applications quickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:32am:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160; “Geneva” gets its first mention. It enables federation between Active Directory and access control in the Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:30am:&lt;/strong&gt; .NET Services are base implementations of the Service Bus, Access Control (federated identity is mentioned), plus Windows Workflow in the Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:28am:&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the goals of Azure is to make it possible to build applications to use the vast processing power to connect people in ways never before available, while reducing your development and deployment costs. You’ll be able to deploy applications more quickly, and have 9-5 management, instead of 24/7 management.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:24am:&lt;/strong&gt; Bob Muglia is now onstage. Talking about the 4 service requirements: Interoperability, identity &amp;amp; Security, Data Management and Compliance, and Services Management. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:23am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Bluehoo is not compatible with the iPhone. &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html"&gt;Help us lobby Apple to make the iPhone compatible with Bluehoo.&lt;/a&gt;” But it is supported on Nokia, Blackberry, Treos, Windows Mobile, and Symbian. I wonder if these phones are supported through Silverlight Mobile?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:21am: “&lt;/strong&gt;Editing your service model is so easy, even a CEO can do it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:15am:&lt;/strong&gt; Jonathan Greenstead from &lt;a href="http://bluehoo.com"&gt;Bluehoo.com&lt;/a&gt; is onstage. It’s a mobile app running on the cloud. It’s a Silverlight application that lets you see people around you. You can check some of it out at &lt;a href="http://keynote.bluehoo.com"&gt;http://keynote.bluehoo.com&lt;/a&gt;. They have a dashboard at &lt;a href="http://keynote.bluehoo.com/dashboard.aspx"&gt;http://keynote.bluehoo.com/dashboard.aspx&lt;/a&gt;. This is how a service dashboard should look.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:12am:&lt;/strong&gt; Now they are doing a “HelloCloud” demo. Using the Azure SDK in VS2008, they show the 4 new cloud templates that use the new ServiceModels, and standard ASP.NET applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“With Windows Azure, you can use our ‘Cloud on a Desktop’ to test the cloud operating environment.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The default domain name for the development portal is “.cloudapp.net”. Right now, check out &lt;a href="http://hellocloud.cloudapp.net"&gt;http://hellocloud.cloudapp.net&lt;/a&gt; for a really cool public app.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:10am:&lt;/strong&gt; Using adaptive scalability, we can provide high availability across thousands of servers. Using our “Desktop Experience,” you won’t need to deploy to the cloud just to test your application.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:08am:&lt;/strong&gt; You model the service and service model through XML, and it appears to use the DSL tools that have been discussed previously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:06am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Azure is a Federated Datacenter Model. At the core is a ‘fabric controller’ that manages all the different cores, and monitors the health of your services.” It manages the whole service, not just the server.” It’s SOA on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:04am:&lt;/strong&gt; Azure runs on a hypervisor. Is it Hyper-V? We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:02am:&lt;/strong&gt; Windows Azure is “Project RedDog” that Mary Jo has been talking about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:01am:&lt;/strong&gt; A gentleman with an unpronounceable mane is onstage,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00am: “&lt;/strong&gt;Some of you may recall hearing about SSDS at Mix. We’re planning on bringing even more to the cloud. We’re planning on bringing SQL Reporting and Analysis services to the cloud. We’re not calling that simply SQL Services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:55am:&lt;/strong&gt; “First, we felt it was critical for Win developers to be able to leverage existing stills. Second, you’d expect a fundamentally open environment for your innovation. being Windows, that’s the environment we intend to grow. But even in that, we need to help developer understand that the Cloud environment is fundamentally new. Most of existing apps are built for a scale-up pattern. Windows Azure is the foundation for the next 50 years of software development, targeting a new world of parallel development. Windows Azure is not an OS on your server, but a platform that runs on Microsoft’s datacenters, first in the US, and later around the world. It is being released today as a CTP.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:54am:&lt;/strong&gt; “I’d like to announce a new Windows offering for the cloud: Windows Azure.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:53am:&lt;/strong&gt; “I’d like to tip my hat to Jeff Bezos and Amazon for creating the baseline for cloud computing through Amazon EC2.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:51am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Now he’s talking about tiers of computing, and how the different tiers affect the connected web.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:48am:&lt;/strong&gt; “A few years ago Microsoft embarked on its own evaluation of how it provides services to their users, be it through Windows Update, Windows Help, or MSDN. Through these different properties, we discovered we had created common expertise between these solutions. Over the years, we accumulated a lot of expertise in those common areas, but they were not able to be packaged in a way that might be helpful to you.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:44am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Now more than ever, the reach and effectiveness of a company’s web presence is critical to their success. For some of those customers, the demands may be seen in peaks and valleys, depending on events in the world, or in the blogosphere. In order to meet these demands, most companies add more resources: more servers, more cooling, more employees. Then you have issues with events like earthquakes which are outside control. So they add another datacenter for redundancy. but even that may not e enough. Then you have latency issues, political issues, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:41am:&lt;/strong&gt; “Over the past couple of weeks I’ve read provocative pieces online that say that the cloud is vastly overblown. It is true that utility computing has been around since the 60’s, and virtualization was invented around the same time. Even in the best of datacenters, most of the solutions are targeted at inward-facing applications. Every company, every school, every government is facing the externalization of services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:39am: &lt;/strong&gt;“For many years, I sat next to you as a colleague and a competitor. For me, there were three things that always brought me back to MS. First was Microsoft always built their own apps for the platform. Second, they are a stable foundation. Third, I knew that Bill &amp;amp; Steve has always viscerally understood that in order for Microsoft to be successful, my business had to be successful.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:37am:&lt;/strong&gt; People are falling all over each other to get pictures of Ray Ozzie.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:31am:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting here early paid off… in the second row with the CNET team right behind me, and Todd Bishop behind them. We’re discussing Windows 7’s impact on consumers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:15am:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey everyone, keep it here for a liveblog about the keynote. It’s not as cool as the one &lt;a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20081028/live-from-pdc08-keynote-ray-ozzie-amitabh-srivastava-bob-muglia-and-david-thompson/"&gt;Long &amp;amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;. is doing… but it should still be fun!

As exciting as it all sounded, I wasn’t planning on attending at all… but I couldn’t resist the opportunity to be one of the first to get a guided tour the hotly-anticipated followup to Widows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since I’m not a short hop away from LA anymore, I actually took a bump off a flight last week to my kid sister’s wedding (the one who had her accident during PDC 2005) to get a free round-trip ticket from FL to CA. The very kind lady at USAirways Reservations worked for almost an hour to make it happen, but I’m on my way as we speak (I have to fly from Tallahassee to Charlotte to Philly to LA, which puts me in around 7pm tonight… a VERY long day). But I’m really excited to be able to cover a good portion of the action going on at PDC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking of ghosts of PDC past, my good friend, new Microsoftie, and former &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/bleblanc"&gt;LonghornBlogger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.windowsvistablog.com"&gt;Brandon LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt; stumbled on a picture on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://microsoftpdc.com"&gt;Microsoft PDC&lt;/a&gt; site that should have been burned. Apparently, it’s in rotation with a bunch of other pictures… and if you look closely, you’ll see someone who obviously didn’t have a woman to improve his fashion sense. Don’t take my word for it, see for yourself…&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/robertatpdc2003_5F00_38904C75.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:block;float:none;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;margin-left:auto;border-left-width:0px;margin-right:auto;" title="robertatpdc2003" border="0" alt="robertatpdc2003" src="http://www.windows-now.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/robert/robertatpdc2003_5F00_thumb_5F00_6DBEF649.jpg" width="627" height="359" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;See the little blue squirrelly guy in the center, barely over a buck-sixty, in the world’s worst Hawaiian shirt? Yep, that’s me, at my first PDC in 2003. I’m pretty sure this was during one of the first Tech Blogger meetups, the Blogger BoF. Thanks to whomever posted this, for finding one of the worst pictures of me &lt;strong&gt;*ever*&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyone up for a little caption contest? The winner will get something from my PDC swag haul. Winner judged by me… keep it PG-13 folks. And keep it right here for more coverage of PDC 2008, featuring Live Mesh, Windows Strata, Windows 7, and .NET 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46459" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/PDC+2003/default.aspx">PDC 2003</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/PDC+2005/default.aspx">PDC 2005</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Live+Mesh/default.aspx">Live Mesh</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+7/default.aspx">Windows 7</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/.NET+4.0/default.aspx">.NET 4.0</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/PDC+2008/default.aspx">PDC 2008</category></item><item><title>And One Service Pack to Rule Them All</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/and-one-service-pack-to-rule-them-all.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2008 17:00:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46458</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Microsoft announced &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/10/24/windows-vista-service-pack-2-beta.aspx"&gt;the first details for the next service pack&lt;/a&gt; for Windows Vista. I’m on the Beta, so hopefully I’ll get my build in the next week or so… if I’m allowed to talk about it, I’ll post details. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyways, one of the things I was the most excited about was not the enhanced Wireless features (although I’m hoping that it solves some problems I’ve been having with my Linksys WRT610N (though more on that fiasco later)… no, I’m most excited about the fact that, due to the massive engineering change that Microsoft undertook in aligning the client and server codebases, there will be one Service Pack 2 download that will work on both Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Will it bring Hyper-V to the client? Will it bring Windows Media Center up to date with the TV Pack bits? I’m not sure… but maybe during my Windows 7 briefings this week I can dig up some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46458" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+Server+2008+SP2/default.aspx">Windows Server 2008 SP2</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Windows+Vista+SP2/default.aspx">Windows Vista SP2</category></item><item><title>Yahoo Dumps WPF Chat Client</title><link>http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/yahoo-dumps-wpf-chat-client.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2008 06:15:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">20f58a17-7e15-440c-89b3-dfe02fe74bcd:46451</guid><dc:creator>Robert McLaws</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px 0px 0px 8px;display:inline;" align="right" src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20081024/yahoo_messenger.png" width="240" height="172" alt="" /&gt; Well, Yahoo today decided to dump the one cool project they had going for them. At Vista’s launch, they showed off a WPF version of their Chat program that blew everyone away. They didn’t even actually build it, the people from Frog Design did. And they spent the last two years with their thumbs up their butts about it, taking forever to release an alpha, then a beta.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Claiming that it won’t run on XP (which is BS, because WPF is in .NET 3.0, which runs &lt;em&gt;just fine&lt;/em&gt; on XP, Yahoo has thrown the code out the window, and will not be releasing a final version.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s just too bad too. I was actually looking forward to using the released version. Which would bring the number of Yahoo! products I use to… 1.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[via &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10074841-56.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-5"&gt;News.com&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.windows-now.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=46451" width="1" height="1"&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/WPF/default.aspx">WPF</category><category domain="http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/tags/Yahoo/default.aspx">Yahoo</category></item></channel></rss>
