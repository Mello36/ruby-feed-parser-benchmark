Pale and sweet dresses are defined by rich black trim, a peasant-style maxi dress feels a bit edgy with cut-outs at the waist, and a simple denim sheath offers a hint of complexity with angular pleating. These are feminine works with a degree of seriousness. Do we see hints of Mayle and Lam throughout the collection? You betcha. Do we love where it's going though? Absolutely. No question, Monteiro is one to watch.<br><br>

A mix of Atari sounds, electro-rock, The Rapture, and just general 1980's madness. <a href="http://www.ohmyrockness.com/BandBio.cfm?BandID=4210"target="_blank" >Ghostland Observatory at Terminal 5. </a><br><br>"Les Enfants Diabolique" is an exhibition of drawings by artist <strong>M. Mararian</strong> that comment on consumerism, fashion, pop culture, and the addictive personalities found in American socierty. Children and infants play the role of lead subjects, to make the sketches even more absurd. Kind of creepy, kind of cool. <a href="http://artlog.com/events/2467-les-enfants-diabolique-a-solo"target="_blank" >M. Mararian's Inky Dreadfuls at McCaig Wells and Rosenthal Gallery. </a><br><br>Ray Davies, lead singer of The Kinks, goes solo. He was mysteriously shot in the leg in 2004, so now he limps.

<strong>Europa Europa</strong> was director Agnieszka Holland's claim to fame in the film world, and the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar back in 1991. A World War II survival story, this one's not exactly gonna get you in a good mood, but it's full of breathtaking performances and amazing writing. <a href="http://www.moma.org/calendar/films.php?id=11211&ref=calendar"target="_blank" >Europa Europa at MoMa.</a><br><br>Oh how we love Czech new wave cinema. When <strong>The Firemen's Ball</strong> was released in 1967 it prompted the resignation of 40,000 Czech firemen... a hilarious, and ridiculous, black comedy that's an allegory for the failures of communism&mdash; as if the Czech would make a film about anything else? <a href="http://www.bam.org/view.aspx?pid=797"target="_blank" >The Firemen's Ball at BAMcinematek.</a><br><br><strong>The Knitting Factory </strong>is moving to Brooklyn (damn, no more watching people wait in line in the rain from our warm and cozy offices...) but for now, they're still Tribeca bound and tonight they're booking all three stages. <a href="http://flavorpill.com/newyork/events/2008/12/13/brava-spectre">Brava Spectre w/ Cave, Dirty Faces, Knyfe Hyts, Parts & Labor, and Oakley Hall at The Knitting Factory.  </a><br><br><em>Saturday and Sunday events below...</em>]]>        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Saturday: </strong><br><br>Bet you didn't know that the remains of over 80,000 patriots are interred in Fort Green Park.

'Tis the season to be jolly, so really treat your dog and go for the full gift set, which includes a sweater and a red leather collar for $375. Because after all, he is man's best friend.

<p>Yesterday, the legendary pin-up model of the 1950s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettie_Page"target="_blank">Bettie Page</a>, died at the age of 85 after collapsing from a heart attack in Los Angeles six days ago. She never woke up. <strong>Posing for theatrically staged fetish pictorials and stag films, Page's vamp looks, blunt bangs, raven hair, sharp lips, pale skin, and dangerous curves wrapped in lingerie (and often less) helped define the modern visual language of sex and kink.</strong> After porn, the woman born Betty Mae Page led a religious, often troubled life and rarely allowed anyone to photograph her, ensuring that she remained the "Queen of Curves". But Page was more than a sex bomb. Through bared breasts, riding crops, and ball gags, Bettie radiated an engaging innocence that made her iconic. Though she never graced the cover of <em>Vogue</em>, Page influenced movies, clothing, hair, innumerable fashion spreads and modern sexual culture itself. Men loved Bettie Page. Women loved Bettie Page. Those who celebrate beauty, kink, sex, and style will always love Bettie Page.
