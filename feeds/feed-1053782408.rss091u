The low valleys surrounded by mountains are criss-crossed by streams, the habitat of beaver and other fur-bearing animals.More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole</description><guid>d88bb919bbe4db5e316820583747d50e</guid></item>

The character of Cathy, who could arguably represent the devil, sets fire to her home while her parents are inside, killing them both. She later goes on to become a whore, only to kill the mistress of the house and take over the business. Possibly a connection, although I think it's just me enjoying the fact that this amazing song reminds me of my favorite book.</description><guid>661a26c218728fe656763b2fd65c4a92</guid></item>

Outside, it evokes the desire to leave life behind and travel. However, I believe there is a deeper message here. &quot;Lets all ride together&quot; could be a metaphor for peace. I read these lyrics as a calling to the people of the world to come together and realize the beauty of simplicity. (&quot;Sleeping beneath the weeds.&quot;) The man in this story can see the opportunity of peace, however he is unable to take the first step and realize what is really wrong with the world. (&quot;Say I got good eyes but I still dont see, why that world keeps crumbling.&quot;) Finally, the line, &quot;Oh, I got good cards but the wrong mans dealin.&quot; could be asserting that while he sees the simplicity of peace, the wrong people are in charge of getting us there. Unbelievable song, Trevor blows my mind daily.  :trevor:</description><guid>bb63d803ce512b0c2c33c02549e3c25d</guid></item>

The song was written as a plea for peace during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It has been covered by hundreds of artists.Trevor Garrod released a version of it on his Myspace page a couple years ago, then TLG played Do You Hear What I Hear (in 2006). :reader:</description><guid>bdef27a54bf10e977013cbc151592608</guid></item>

So take a deep breath cuz were already makin it. Well its time to relax, and get naked.&quot; is out of this world. This band has a way of summing up life in such a simple way. I love Josh's straightforward approach to love in his lyrics. As far as I know this song has only been played maybe a hand full of times. I would like to see this in rotation more, its worthy.</description><guid>e5472b8ed2232ffa672814f380ae2c2e</guid></item>

These lyrics are some of Trevor's best. I think it really resonates the empty feeling of a broken heart. Sometimes life is just so hard that you just want to &quot;stay home&quot;. This may be my favorite lyrical work by TLG.</description><guid>9124a55d246fa7b03d38acef9351c09f</guid></item>

Listen to the entire 1st set, if you're still able to post come back and tell us about it. Pure heat.http://www.archive.org/details/tlg2004-09-24.flac164-2-08, the only time I've seen it live (out of 4); alas, was not recorded.</description><guid>6b6301f43c0ffc66cbde82fd29e89b8c</guid></item>

It's like a wallet card that says &quot;Supporting Member of The Garden.&quot;This is the first time for that. Slept hasn't traditionally been associated with The Garden sequence. Lyrically it's ambiguous enough that you can fit it into the Garden story if you want to (There's an &quot;I&quot; character in the Garden that's semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical Trevor... and the &quot;I&quot; who found God last Saturday night in Slept can be the same person in the story). But it wasn't conceived to be there in the first place when Slept was written independently. Whenever a song is &quot;planted&quot; in the middle of the Garden in a setlist like this, it brings up the affiliation, and makes a unique Garden sequence that can be reimagined with the new element (if only for that one time).</description><guid>114a808c35f3ee50cf4d27ea4447d42a</guid></item>
