In our workshop, we usually read an article from several English newspapers, but today, after chatting in English as usual, we watched one of my favorite films, "Notting Hill." I thought watching a movie would be an interesting way to improve our listening comprehension skills.<br /><br />'I'd better be going."<br />"Tempting, but, no (thank you)." <br />"I'm just looking around."<br />"I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her." <br /><br />I've learned so many English expressions from this movie. <br /><br /><br /><br /> ]]>

<title>Anybody can make a mistake.</title>
<description> While taking an English writing class today, I asked my teacher to help me understand a sentence from an English newspaper. Let me introduce you the sentence here.&quot;I hope to our life can return to normal.&quot;I didn't understand why they put &quot;to&quot; after &quot;hope.&quot; We say &quot;I hope to see you again.&quot; or &quot;I hope you like it,&quot; but in this case, shouldn't it have been &quot;I hope (that) our life can return to norma

<![CDATA[ <br /><br />While taking an English writing class today, I asked my teacher to help me understand a sentence from an English newspaper. Let me introduce you the sentence here.<br /><br /><strong>"I hope to our life can return to normal."</strong><br /><br /><br />I didn't understand why they put "to" after "hope." We say "I hope to see you again." or "I hope you like it," but in this case, shouldn't it have been "I hope (that) our life can return to normal."? <br /><br /><br />My teacher said, "No wonder you've been confused, because this sentence is not correct."<br /><br /><br />Oh my gosh, but this comes from an English newspaper!<br />Newspapers should be a role model for any writer, I suppose!<br /><br /><br />"That's why I've kept telling you! Teachers make mistakes, anybody makes mistakes, and do newspapers. I can tell you this. It'd be better to follow your instinct whenever you are in trouble."<br /><br /><br />Gee... <br /><br /><br /> ]]>

<title>Listen to Your Heart</title>
<description> Listen to your heartWhen he is calling for youListen to your heart There is nothing else you can doThis is one of the songs that my friend introduced me before going back to his country. This song reminds me of the days we spent together. I didn't know that Roxette sang a song for a movie entitled &quot;Pretty Woman.&quot; No wonder her voice sounded a bit familiar to me. I highly recommend this CD to you.A

They look perfectly good, and I can still wear them.<br />When I was a child, my mother would laugh and say "You really keep your things well so I don't need to buy new ones for you." <br />I can't say I am a neat person to care for the things I have, but I'd say I'm not into buying new things. <br /><br /><br /> ]]>
