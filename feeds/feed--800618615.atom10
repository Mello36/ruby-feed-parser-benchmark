			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All you superhero comic book movie geeks out there like me will certainly geek out over this. Film School Rejects posted this screenshot this morning showing a blink-and-you&#8217;ll-miss-it moment in the alternate opening sequence included in the DVD bonus features. Screenshot and more after the jump.<span id="more-545"></span><br />
As we all know, there is a larger franchise being built around the Marvel superhero movies right now that started earlier this year with &#8220;Iron Man&#8221;. For those of you up in your comic book history, Iron Man and Hulk were members of the Avengers, a super-group put together by S.H.I.E.L.D. and Nick Fury. In &#8220;Iron Man&#8221;, we saw the introduction of S.H.I.E.L.D. and, if you stayed through the end credits, got to see Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury recruiting Tony Stark into the Avengers. If you were really quick, though, you would have caught Captain America&#8217;s <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/05/10/captain-americas-shield-spotted-in-iron-man/" target="_blank">shield</a> in that movie too.</p>
<div id="attachment_553" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ironmancapt.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-553" title="ironmancapt" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ironmancapt.jpg" alt="What's that on the table behind Tony, left side under his arm?" width="500" height="206" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What&#39;s that on the table behind Tony, left side under his arm?</p></div>
<p>So, some eagle-eyed geeks watching the extra features on &#8220;The Incredible Hulk&#8221; DVD caught this screencap in the alternate opening sequence. The alternate opening was originally rumored to have some kind of scene with a live Captain America in it, but I think that rumor got squashed eventually. In the opening, Edward Norton&#8217;s Bruce Banner is wandering the Antarctic trying not to Hulk-out. Of course, he does. Near the end of the opening, there is an avalanche that roars towards the camera, and if you&#8217;re quick, you see this just before it hits:</p>
<div id="attachment_548" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 509px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/captain-america-hulk-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-548" title="captain-america-hulk-2" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/captain-america-hulk-2.jpg" alt="Brief outline of a body under that shield? Head at top left, body going diagonal right?" width="499" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brief outline of a body under that shield? Head at top left, body going diagonal right?</p></div>
<p>We know there is a Captain America movie in development, along with a Thor movie, Iron Man 2, and the Avengers movie with them all together. You have to hand it to Marvel, that is one thing that was always exciting in comic books growing up, the &#8220;cross-over&#8221; factor, when one superhero makes an unexpected cameo in another book. They&#8217;ve managed to successfully translate that concept into film, and as a geek, I&#8217;m lovin&#8217; it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Folks from the Prius development team posted the first official teaser for the 2010 Prius on a Prius enthusiast forum I&#8217;m a member of, PriusChat. It&#8217;s not much yet, not a shot of the car itself, and there&#8217;s some discussion as to what exactly it is we&#8217;re seeing, though it really boils down to one of two possibilities.<span id="more-538"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/prius-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-539" title="prius-1" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/prius-1.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>In their post they say,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It’s officially coming. We can’t wait to share more details with you, but as you can imagine, we don’t want to spoil the big surprise. So, here’s a little peek to get you started. Yes, it’s the real thing, straight from Toyota’s Prius Team, we promise. No, we can’t answer any of the questions you’re going to have, but we bet you can figure out the pieces to the puzzle if you tune in to your favorite Prius sites regularly. As a thank you for your enthusiasm, we just wanted to make sure that you were the first to see this official shot. </span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That shot is from one of two places - either the center Multi-Function Display startup screen (as most people thought initially), or it could be a new screen for the speedometer / fuel guage area. Given the width of the graphic above and the resolution of the image, it&#8217;s likely that might be the right answer. If it were the MFD, the resolution would be higher, the graphic would be crisper, so I&#8217;m betting that it&#8217;s along the instrument panel area. I&#8217;m happy with my 2009 Prius, but that 2010 is going to be sweet with the optional solar panels.</p>

<p>Ok, this will be one of the only politcally related posts you see on this blog (other than, of course, comparing <a href="http://geektalkstech.com/mccainpalin-could-be-the-bsg-ticket-lead-to-better-humancylon-relations/" target="_blank">McCain/Palin to Tigh/Roslyn for the BSG ticket</a>, but that was more humor than political). I normally don&#8217;t talk much politics as it tends to be an extremely personal thing to most people and feelings get hurt too easily over it. I keep my views and leanings to myself, unless there is a technological aspect to it that I can&#8217;t keep my mouth shut on (Net Neutrality, for one). That being said, I&#8217;m going to be really glad when this brutal election season is over, as I&#8217;m really tiring of crap like this from both sides<span id="more-491"></span></p>
<p>In Tuesday&#8217;s town-hall style debate, McCain was trying to make a point about Obama&#8217;s willingness to approve &#8220;pork-barrel&#8221; spending and earmarks to bills that go through Congress. This has happened for many, many years and, in my opinion, is an overall weakness to the political process itself. Bills should be passed on their own merit and hang-on allotments should not be allowed - they should be submitted in their own bills, but that&#8217;s kind of a tangent to this discussion anyway. One example of an earmark that Obama supposedly supported was for a, and in McCain&#8217;s own words,</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="intelliTXT">While we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks he (Senator Obama) voted for nearly $1 billion in pork barrel earmark projects. Including $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The guys over at Gearlog did some <a href="http://www.gearlog.com/2008/10/the_case_of_the_3_million_over.php" target="_blank">research </a>to find out exactly what McCain was talking about. You can get a pretty kick-ass 1080p projector for less than $5,000, so what kind of &#8220;overhead projector&#8221; could they possibly be wasting $3 Million on? Well, the planetarium references was the <a href="http://adlerplanetarium.org/">Adler Planetarium</a> in Chicago, and it wasn&#8217;t exactly a classroom overhead projector they were asking for. From their press release on Wednesday after the debates,</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://adlerplanetarium.org/pressroom/pr/2008_10_08_AdlerStatement_aboutdebate.pdf">Adler Planetarium Press Release</a>: The Adler&#8217;s Zeiss Mark VI projector - not an overhead projector - is the instrument that re-creates the night sky in a dome theater, the quintessential planetarium experience. The Adler&#8217;s projector is nearly 40 years old and is no longer supported with parts or service by the manufacturer. It is only the second planetarium projector in the Adler&#8217;s 78 years of operation.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_492" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 367px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/universarium_stuttgart.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-492" title="universarium_stuttgart" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/universarium_stuttgart.jpg" alt="The proposed Mark IX" width="357" height="268" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The proposed Mark IX</p></div>
<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about one of the large projectors in the center of a plantarium that shows the night sky for sky shows - quite a different monster than a overhead projector as McCain kind of made that sound. As they stated, their current one is 40 years old and now out of support for parts and service, meaning if something breaks on it, the planetarium is out of business. Personally, sounds like a good purchase to me, and museums do get federal funding along with private endowments, so I don&#8217;t fully see what the real issue is here (except for my earlier stated disdain for extra things being thrown into unrelated bills to ride on their coattails for approval).</p>
<p>As Gearlog closes with, there is a side discussion on whether or not the cost should be footed by taxpayer dollars or through revenue or endowments to the planetarium. But it&#8217;s hard to have that discussion when the introduction to the issue is so slanted for purely political reasons. I can remember going to <a href="http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/" target="_blank">Morehead Planetarium</a> at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill when I was a kid, and another planetarium at the Smithsonian museum in DC (Dad, if you&#8217;re reading this, as a father now I can fully appreciate why you fell asleep in there - chairs lean back, lights go out, kids keep you up all night so yeah, it&#8217;s a perfect recipe for sleep. I&#8217;ll just try not to snore when I take Alex to one <img src='http://geektalkstech.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ). It helped to fuel my passion for science, astronomy, and science fiction. Having a kid who is obsessed with the universe, I cannot wait to take him to a planetarium as well someday, and I&#8217;d be really dismayed if this type of museum goes away because there were no funds allocated to it along with other federally or state funded museums. But that, as I said, is an entirely different discussion.</p>
<p>The whole issue is a moot point, though, as the funding was not passed and the planetarium didn&#8217;t get their new &#8220;overhead projector&#8221; anyway.</p>

Portal has to be one of my all time favorite games.

<p>Portal has to be one of my all time favorite games. It was such a simple concept, and was so well executed in both gameplay, puzzles, mind-bending interpretations of the laws of physics, and a slowly unfolding backstory revolving around A.I. going mad, it&#8217;s hard to imagine any other game being able to hit on all cylinders like that again. Well, it appears that lightning might just be striking twice in the form of a game mod using the Portal engine called &#8220;Portal: Prelude&#8221;. Teaser trailer and some newly released gameplay video after the break.<span id="more-481"></span></p>

<p>Developed over about 9 months time by <a href="http://www.portalprelude.com/team.php" target="_blank">Nicolas Grevet,</a> he seems to have captured everything that was so appealing about the original game. The puzzles forcing you to think outside the gravity-box, unseen observers mocking you sarcastically as you make your way through the test chambers, the promise of cake, all in the name of science. It apparently takes place at Aperture Science before GLaDOS, but the two researchers you hear sound very computer-like (mainly because they were voiced by synthesized voices, I think?) rather than human. I thought they were maybe early versions of GLaDOS, but early reviews say they are researchers that you see behind frosted panes of glass during the tests (you catch a glimpse in the teaser trailer above).</p>

<p>But the gameplay, as shown above, is where the game really shines. This looks like a great addition to the Portal mythology, and simply said, Valve needs to hire this team pronto before someone else snaps them up. Portal: Prelude is available on October 10th, though it looks like you can get it early through <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/">FilePlanet</a> and <a href="http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/">Planet Half-Life</a>. The only thing better is if they could get Jonathon Coulton to write a new song around this one too.</p>

Since I did a review of The Force Unleashed earlier, I took some interest in hearing Ben &#8220;Yahtzee&#8221; Croshaw&#8217;s take on the game. For those of you who haven&#8217;t seen he&#8217;s previous game reviews, he&#8217;s a maniac with a unique style for his reviews. First off, he&#8217;s British, but don&#8217;t let that scare you.

<p>Since I did a review of The Force Unleashed <a href="http://geektalkstech.com/star-wars-the-force-unleashed-is-well-unleashed-on-my-wii/" target="_blank">earlier</a>, I took some interest in hearing Ben &#8220;Yahtzee&#8221; Croshaw&#8217;s take on the game. For those of you who haven&#8217;t seen he&#8217;s previous game reviews, he&#8217;s a maniac with a unique style for his reviews. First off, he&#8217;s British, but don&#8217;t let that scare you. Second, he talks fast than most New Yorkers that I know, and coupled with the accent might make it a little hard to follow. But it&#8217;s the fast delivery (hence, the name &#8220;Zero Punctuation&#8221;) and his incredibly dry and brutal wit that makes his reviews so great. When he likes a game (which, honestly, is rare), he gives some great insight into the great things about a game and gaming in general. When he doesn&#8217;t like a game, watch out. Needless to say, he didn&#8217;t like The Force Unleashed on the Wii, and for some reasons I agree with and some I have to take some issue with. His geek rant on George Lucas, however, is spot on and certainly delivered with the ferocity of a long time Star Wars fan betrayed by Lucas one too many times. Embedded video after the jump.<span id="more-475"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s his latest review for The Force Unleashed, not safe for work or kiddos due to language. So if you have headphones, put &#8216;em on now:</p>

<p>Ok, I can certainly agree that the graphics are gimped. As I&#8217;ve been playing it more I&#8217;ve been less and less impressed with them. Items in the landscape seem to grow out of the ground as you approach them, obviously there&#8217;s not enough horsepower on the Wii to generate a large field of tall grass, but seeing the grass literally expand out of the ground as you&#8217;re running around the levels pulls me out of the game as well. I saw a great deal on an XBOX 360 the other day, and almost got it just so that I could have the great graphics experience (will probably wind up with a PS3 at some point instead for the Blu-Ray, and because I don&#8217;t want a Red Ring of Death) and the enhanced physics engines (DMM and Havoc). They try to make it up to us Wii users by giving us extra levels back at the Jedi Temple and the duel mode, both exclusive to the Wii, but then they also took away the Imperial Star Destroyer fight (got there last night, and he takes the Destroyer down but it&#8217;s all a cut scene, no gameplay battle). So, I agree whole-heartedly with Yahtzee on the graphics and being better off on the PS3 version.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t fully agree with his problems with the control schemes, though. I actually think the &#8220;MotionPlus 1:1&#8243; attachement coming soon for the Wii would make the game more difficult, as let&#8217;s be honest here, who can really swing a lightsaber with the kind of grace and accuracy that you want to see the Apprentice do on screen? Left-to-right, up-and-down, and thrusting-stabbing motions are certainly fine by me, it does let me have some kind of control about what kind of blow he&#8217;s going to take and let the game animate it properly and strike well. I loved Yahtzee&#8217;s descriptions in the video and laughed my head off, but I can&#8217;t say I share his disdain for them.</p>
<p>Check out the other game reviews Yahtzee has, short, sweet, and quite vulgar so make sure not to play it too loud around the kiddos.</p>

This second episode brings us back to the Anakin / Ahsoka show, but introduces Plo Koon and an awesomely frightening General Grevious into the storyline. Full episode synopsis and my reaction after the break. <span id="more-457"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_468" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/plokoon.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-468" title="plokoon" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/plokoon-300x166.jpg" alt="Plo Koon surveying the situation" width="300" height="166" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Plo Koon surveying the situation</p></div>
<p>The newsreel-style intro and booming announcer starts the episode with the setup - the Separatists have a new weapon, mysterious and deadly, that no witnesses have survived to tell exactly what it is. The Republic send Plo Koon and three Interceptor ships to a system where they believe this weapon is to gather more information. First things first, Plo Koon speaks, and he sounds like he wants to order Grey Poupon. I was expecting a more alien, raspy sounding voice, but hey, I got used to it quickly and it seemed to fit his stature and grace of movement, so I can go along. He tries to contact Anakin and Ahsoka for some backup, but Dooku and Grevious jam their signal before he can complete the conversation and the Separatists test their new weapon on Plo Koon&#8217;s fleet, conveniently grouped together so a single shot from the Separatist&#8217;s secret ion cannon disables all the electronic systems on all three ships. They are sitting ducks, and Grevious orders all cannons to take them out. One by one, the ships are easily destroyed, but not before Koon and three clones get out on an escape pod, one of many clone-filled pods that get off their ship. Grevious sends in the hunters to clean up the mess and make sure there are no Republic witnesses to their new surprise weapon.</p>
<div id="attachment_460" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/clones.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-460" title="clones" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/clones-300x168.jpg" alt="One bleached, one with a weird double mohawk - the newest boy band craze?" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One bleached, one with a weird double mohawk - the newest boy band craze?</p></div>
<p>Ahsoka convinces Anakin to go look for Plo Koon against the council&#8217;s orders, she doesn&#8217;t want to accept the fact that he might have been killed in the Separatist attack. We learn the history between Plo and Ahsoka, that he is the Jedi who found Ahsoka as a baby and brought her to the Temple, so there is a special bond between the two of them. Cut back to Plo&#8217;s escape pod, and we get a conversation between Plo and the clones similar to the Yoda one in the previous episode. The clones manage to get some power going to try and signal for help. They pick up the signal from another pod, and hear a bit of their disturbing death as the hunter droids open up their pod and release them into space (a little more droid humor, &#8220;There they go!&#8221; one of them delights as the clones screaming goes off in the distance). Plo says he&#8217;s going outside, as he can take space conditions for a short time. Two of the clones come with him in their suits, and one stays inside the pod. As the hunters come for their pod, Plo and the clones surprise them and through a pretty cool zero-G Force move, Plo gets one of the clones behind the droids and takes them out.</p>

<p>When the council finds out from Obi-Wan that Anakin and Ahsoka went to find Plo Koon, Palpatine is visibly unnerved. He contacts Anakin and lays the guilt trip on him that he must follow the orders of the council, but we all really know the reason why he doesn&#8217;t want Plo to be found. Anakin is about to turn back, when Ahsoka feels Plo&#8217;s presence through the Force. Happy reunion, and a medical droid begins seeing to them on Anakin&#8217;s ship. Now, Grevious and Dooku have realized that their hunters haven&#8217;t reported back in, knowing now that there are some survivors left over that they don&#8217;t want, so they go back to finish the job. Plo sees their ship coming and tells Anakin to shut off anything electrical on the ship, even R2-D2 in the cockpit. He wants to hide from their sensors, but they are found out when the medical droid comes in to ask why they turned off the power. Anakin powers back up and makes a break for it, but Grevious fires the secret weapon. There&#8217;s a chase through the wreckage of the first battle, as Anakin tries to outrun the blastwave from the cannon, getting into clear space where R2 can fire up the hyperdrive and get them out of there. They get away, Dooku calls Grevious&#8217; failure &#8220;most unfortunate&#8221; and goes off to speak with his Master and find out what to do now. We get back to the Republic fleet with Anakin, Ahsoka, and Plo, where the clones thank Anakin for coming back to get them. Plo says it&#8217;s time for them to give their report back to the council, Anakin invites Ahsoka saying she did well, she didn&#8217;t give up, and that if he&#8217;s getting in trouble for defying the council, he&#8217;s sharing the blame with her. Fade to credits.</p>

<p>My Padawan likes this episode better than the first one, again I think the short format really helps to give a bite-sized plot, some good action sequences, and continuing the plot line of the clones finding their individualism. They are encouraged by the Jedi to be who they are, not just an expendable clone. One of the clones in this episode says that &#8220;we&#8217;re expendable&#8221; and Plo replies &#8220;Not to me&#8221;. Almost brings a tear to the eye. Especially when the clones turn on the Jedi around Order 66 and prove that they aren&#8217;t individuals at all. I couldn&#8217;t help but play Plo Koon&#8217;s death back in my head in Episode III and feel even worse about it due to the plot lines here, the mutual trust and respect that the Jedi and Clones shared.</p>

<p>As with the first episode, the animation was pretty good. I did see some odd mouth movements that didn&#8217;t seem like the audio was synced up properly, mainly in the last scene with Anakin and Ahsoka. But, overall, I must say that the animation is really bringing them to life well. Plo Koon looked great, and the animated Anakin shows a wider range of emotion than Hayden Christensen ever could.</p>

<p>And Grevious . . . oh, Grevious. He looks absolutely perfect. So perfect, in fact, that it almost doesn&#8217;t work for me. Here&#8217;s my problem. In the original Clone Wars series on Cartoon Network, the little 5-10 minute animated episodes, we got to see Grevious animated in the same style as those characaters. When I first saw the character models for this CG-animated series, I saw the parallels in the character stylings from the earler series. Linear, sharp lines and corners, proportions that might be just a little odd. I wasn&#8217;t initially a fan, but it did grow on me as the run-up to the movie happened. Now, we see Grevious, and he looks just like he did in Revenge of the Sith. Which, on one hand, is great as I thought he was a good, but underused, character in that movie. Knowing we&#8217;ll see more of him and even his origin in future episodes of the Clone Wars was gold to me. But, because he looks so much like the movie counterpart, it takes me out of the animation style a bit as all of the other characters are interpreted differently than their movie counterparts. Count Dooku is a great example of that, with his chin-beard coming to a point that could be as much of a weapon as his lightsaber. That&#8217;s really my only beef, though, as we get Matt Wood doing the voice for Grevious, which again, is full of awesome in my book.</p>

<p>Overall, a solid second episode for the series. The next episode seems to be a continuation in some manner, if for no other reason than the title, &#8220;Shadow of Malevolence&#8221;. The next episode, as described in its official synopsis,</p>
<blockquote><p>With the help of his Padawan Ahsoka and Jedi Master Plo Koon, Anakin utilizes new long-range Y-wing bombers to lead a bold strike on General Grievous&#8217; warship the <em>Malevolence</em> and its destructive weapon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the preview from StarWars.com</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still on board with the series, it has certainly exceeded my expectations based on the movie this summer. The Force is stong with this one&#8230;</p>

<p>I stumbled across this today, and while it doesn&#8217;t completely fit the &#8220;Geek Talks Tech&#8221; theme, it does certainly fit with the theme of the travelling geek. And the bad dancing geek. Matt was a self-professed deadbeat from Connecticut who thought the perfect life would be designing and playing video games (that&#8217;s the first geek tie-in). He did this for a while and found some success, but decided something was missing and in 2003 quit his job and travelled around Asia until his money ran out. His friend video taped him doing a really bad dance and uploaded it to the net, and the rest is really history. More on the story and the resulting video after the break. <span id="more-450"></span></p>
<p>He was contacted soon after by Stride Gum (why Stride Gum, I have no idea, but keep going) who wanted to pay for him to travel around to a bunch of countries, do his little dance at each stop, and upload the produced video. What 32-year old idiot without a job or kids wouldn&#8217;t take that offer? I would in a heartbeat, but it&#8217;s a little tougher to pull off with a job and a family. Anyway, that went over well and I vaguely remember the resulting video from that outing. About a year later, he decided that it would be even more cool if he got locals to dance with him, and Stride Gum footed the bill again. 14-months and 42 countries later, we get this new video that is absolutely one of the most humanly inspiring videos I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. I&#8217;ve embedded the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">YouTube</span> Vimeo video here, but click on to his site for the better quality versions - he has a high-def one in 720p and the visuals in each locale are really stunning (I had originally embedded the YouTube one, but the Vimeo one is of better quality than that so I replaced it).</p>

<p>Really, what this video tells me is that no matter where you are in the world, bad dancing geeks are there somewhere. Whether it be Israel or the West Bank, Ireland or London, South Africa or Kenya, Japan, India, or Korea (well, maybe not Korea - that DMZ guard wasn&#8217;t playing along) we&#8217;re all really the same, we are all citizens of Earth.

This review is for the first of the two episodes premiered last night, &#8220;Ambush&#8221;, and it fulfilled my expectations, even exceeded them to a point. Full episode synopsis and my take on the new generation of Star Wars series.<span id="more-420"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_438" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/toydariankinganddooku.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-438" title="toydariankinganddooku" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/toydariankinganddooku-300x221.jpg" alt="Dooku tries to make the king an offer he can't refuse" width="300" height="221" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dooku tries to make the king an offer he can&#39;t refuse</p></div>
<p>The episode starts off with the same newsreel-style intro that I complained about in the movie. It works better here, though, again because of the shorter format and knowing you&#8217;re watching on TV instead of the big screen. We are taken to the system of Toydaria, where the king and his guards are waiting on a strategically located moon for Yoda to come negotiate a treaty with them in order to build a Republic base there. Asajj Ventress shows up with a holographic Count Dooku to make a counter offer, hoping to get the Toydarian&#8217;s allegiance to the Separatists instead. They had set a trap for Yoda&#8217;s Republic ship and believe they have chased him away from the moon. Yoda escaped the ship with three Clone Troopers in an escape pod to land on the moon, though, and quickly establishes contact with the king and Asajj. Asajj proposes to the king that if Yoda can make it to them, he can sign the treaty with the Republic, but if she can stop Yoda the king must sign with the Separatists. The king is reluctant, but Yoda chimes in, &#8220;Accept the challenge, I will.&#8221; And the chase is on.</p>
<div id="attachment_433" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/droidsonthemove.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-433" title="droidsonthemove" src="http://geektalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/droidsonthemove-300x215.jpg" alt="Droids firing (uselessly) at Yoda and Clones" width="300" height="215" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Droids firing (uselessly) at Yoda and Clones</p></div>
<p>The battle droids in their tanks catch up to Yoda and the three clones he&#8217;s with, but <em>comically</em> their tanks can&#8217;t fit into the coral-looking forest they are hiding in. So, they decide to come in on foot, and Yoda easily has his way with them without even lifting his lightsaber, basically just bouncing around and making them shoot each other. When the larger Super Battle droids come in firing at the other three clones, the Lieutenant (we later learn his name is Thire) is injured and Yoda appears to help cover them while they hide behind some rocks. Yoda then uses the Force to life one of the droids and have it continue firing on the other droids before Force-pushing the remaining ones into a lump of twisted metal. The droid commander communicates back to Asajj on their trouble, and she is inept as usual while the King simply laughs.</p>

<p>Yoda and the Clones go to a large canyon with caves to rest up a bit, and we get a great conversation where Yoda tells the Clones that rather than being expendable and all the same guy, that they are each individuals and valuable in their own right. He has the Clones take off their helmets, and we learn their names are Thire, Jek (the bald heavy-weapons guy), and Rys. A nice young-reader&#8217;s introduction to existentalism. The droid army comes into the canyon looking for our Republic heros, and Yoda tells the clones to wait on the upper ridge while he takes care of them, saying, &#8220;Know the time to help me, you will&#8221;. Yoda preceeds to open up some serious Jedi whoop-ass on the droids, making me wonder a bit how the Separatist army lasted as long as they have. We get some more really bad battle droid &#8220;comic relief&#8221;, and the Jek fires his last rocket at the cliff, crushing the remaining Droidekas that have appeared. When the king sees that Yoda has easily dispatched all the Separatists threw at him, he tells Dooku thanks but no thanks, to which Dooku tells Asajj to kill the king. She pulls out both her lightsabers and just as she&#8217;s about to strike him down, Yoda is there and halts her with the Force. After a little verbal back and forth, he easily pushes her back and saying, &#8220;Strong you are with the Dark Side, young one. But not <em>that</em> strong&#8221;, with a sly grin he deactivates and pulls away her lightsabers. Wow, that&#8217;s gotta be awkward. He gives the sabers back to Asajj, who creates a distraction and escapes. Yoda and the king make their treaty honorably, and fly off into the sunset to end the episode.</p>

<p>Ok, let&#8217;s start at the top here. I&#8217;m sorry, but Dooku and Asajj are completely impotent here. How the Separatist army could have possibly gotten this far in the war I cannot comprehend. The battle droids are inept, can the worst possible shots in the galaxy. I mean, the scene where Thire is injured, he&#8217;s sitting right out in the open and the advancing droids cannot hit him or Rys when he comes out to help him. And Dooku relying on the droids to defeat Yoda? Come on, at least send Ventress after him (although we see later that she&#8217;s just as useless). If you think the war in Iraq has been mismanaged, at least be thankful we don&#8217;t have Dooku running things. So, unless in future episodes we see the Separatists win some battles, they simply don&#8217;t pose a strong enough threat to be believable in this series as of yet.</p>

<p>The pathetic attempts at battle droid humor are still there, but much easier to take in this shortened format. You have the battle droids expaining his bad marksmanship (&#8221;It&#8217;s my programming!&#8221;), the Super Battle Droids somehow now being able to speak (the one Yoda turns around pleads with the others not to shoot him, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a major malfunction!&#8221;), and the droid commander lamenting when Yoda tears him apart, &#8220;I just got promoted!&#8221;. As with the movie, my Padawan thought it was hillarious, so I guess this is how they are trying to make it appeal to the younger set. I&#8217;ll let it pass. I was also disappointed to hear that Christopher Lee is no longer doing Dooku as he did for the movie, but that was a big wish to get him for the recurring role for a TV show. Corey Burton takes over again, the same voice behind the original Clone Wars series&#8217; Dooku, and he does a fine job.</p>

<p>Now, on to the good stuff. The animation is top notch, right on par with the movie&#8217;s animation. The battle droids all look great, which they should as they are taken directly from the CG battle droids we saw in the movies. Overall the voice work in this episode was good, Tom Kane&#8217;s Yoda was better here than in the movie, in my opinion. He got to be more michevious in his lines and delivery as he was toying with the droid army, and it brought back memories of the Yoda we met in Empire Strikes Back - &#8220;Looking for someone? Found someone, you have, mmm?&#8221; with that funny little laugh. And Yoda kicks ass big time, which is always fun to watch the little whirling dervish.</p>

<p>The plot was simple, but perfect for a half-hour show and my Padawan&#8217;s AD-OS (Attention Defici . . . Oooh, Shiny!!). The action was split into nice bite size amounts, serving to move the story on and wrapping everything up in a nice little bow at the end. What I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing more of is the Clones&#8217; learning more about being individuals from their Jedi leaders. This was mentioned kind of in passing in the recent movie, but I talked about it in more in my earlier review of that <a href="http://geektalkstech.com/master-and-padawan-go-to-see-clone-wars/" target="_blank">here</a>. I&#8217;m happy to see them expanding more on this, as seeing the Jedi&#8217;s compassion and leadership to the Clones who are branching out into diferent personalities and individuals gives them a sense of purpose. Really, it&#8217;s a good introduction into a usually-heavy philisophical concept of existentialism. Why am I here? Who am I really? To see the relationships grow between Jedi and Clones will make Order 66 that much more tragic. Honestly, during those scenes in RotS, my heart really does sink and the room gets a bit dusty. Seeing more of their actual relationships and the mutual respect that the Jedi have for the Clones, I&#8217;m going to be a blubbering mess the next time I watch that movie.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a great start to the series. I&#8217;ll have a review of the second episode shown, &#8220;Rising Malevolence&#8221; up soon, and I&#8217;m looking forward to continuing this series with my Padawans. I&#8217;m going to have to upgrade my TiVo again to fit all this Star Wars stuff on there, but that&#8217;s an entirely different post subject.</p>
