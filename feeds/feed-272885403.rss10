<![CDATA[ Yesterday, my family and I went to <a href="http://www.miyakagu.co.jp/wood/desk_fair/index.html" target="_blank" title="a furniture shop">a furniture shop</a> that I wrote about before. <br /><br />One of my blog friends is working there. Usually, she does not work on Sunday but she was there yesterday. She said that the shop was very busy in December and she could not get the day off work.<br />(By the way, to my surprise my father knew the president of the company. He is my blog friend's father-in-law. The other day, I visited my parents' home and said that we had bought my daughter's desk there. My father was a bit surprised  having heard that. Of course, I was surprised, too. What a small world!)<br /><br />As I wrote before, my family and I stained many, many parts of my daughter's desk and my computer rack. It took about 5 hours. We enjoyed the job, even though it was a bit hard.<br /><br />We are going to assemble them on the Sunday after next. I can hardly wait it.<br /><a href="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0085.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0085s.jpg" alt="Desk_parts_no1" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0086.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0086s.jpg" alt="Desk_parts_no1" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0087.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0087s.jpg" alt="Desk_parts_no1" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0088.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0088s.jpg" alt="Desk_parts_no1" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0089.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/n/a/n/nanazo0326/NEC_0089s.jpg" alt="Desk_parts_no1" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><strong>【After correcting】</strong><br /> ]]>
