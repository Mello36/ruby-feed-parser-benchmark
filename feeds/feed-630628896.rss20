         <title>Using Social Media to Shorten Sales Cycles </title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Social media and online communities have exploded over the past few years, but most B2B marketers still haven't figured out how social media can be implemented and monetized as part of their overall marketing strategies. With stable revenue sources already in place, insignificant budgets for developing and building new (and untested) marketing tools, and little data on the ROI of social media, &lt;a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.san&amp;s=93322&amp;Nid=48678&amp;p=975096"&gt;B2B marketers are sticking with traditional online models&lt;/a&gt; (including lead generation and banner advertising) and resisting the inclusion of social media tools on their sites and in their campaigns. &lt;img alt="staircase.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/staircase.jpg" width="195" height="195" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company is already running a website that, through email marketing, SEO tactics, and organic traffic, attracts return visitors regularly and requires users to register to view content, than adding social media and networking tools is a logical next step for growing your business. By providing loyal users with a website focused on serving their needs and hearing their opinions, you build stickiness into your site, encourage increased  engagement with your content, and gain priceless insight into what your members are researching, testing out, engaging with, and most of all - thinking about purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B2B marketers already know that the buying process is lengthy, especially when big businesses are making the purchases, and everyone from the development group to the CFO is involved in making the final decision. This process means that B2B buyers seek out content, share their findings with colleagues, engage with various kinds of research materials, and consume educational materials until a consensus is achieved and a purchase is made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If marketers already know that the B2B buying process lasts anywhere from 3 - 18 months (depending on the size/revenue of the buyer &amp;  the costs involved), and that successfully navigating this process requires offering a range of content and content delivery methods that appeal to potential buyers, than creating a venue where users return regularly, engage with your content, and express their needs (via created content, forums/commenting, reviews, and content consumption) is an ideal way to identify and target users with appropriate and timely messages that ideally help shorten the sales cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By implementing social tools on your site, the quantity, quality, and type of user data that can be collected and analyzed changes, and you gain access to previously unavailable information that can guide you in targeting, customizing and delivering content delivered to users right as they realize that what you've delivered is exactly what they need. While you may need to develop new ways of tracking and reporting how users interact with your site, your efforts will pay off in the form of new types of data that can be used for marketing purposes, included as part of your lead scoring efforts, or offered to clients in an effort to increase your overall cost-per-lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these challenging economic times, vendors are looking for as much information about their prospects as possible, so they can leverage the data and reach out to niche markets, segment their leads according to their stage in the buying cycle, and arm themselves with a better understanding of each of their leads. Allowing users to express themselves via social media tools, self-submit personal information related to their buying needs, and engage with content on their own terms allows leads to fulfill their own research and education needs, and provides sales with a more complete picture of their prospect. Armed with this kind of full-bodied data, you can potentially remove yourself from having to nurture leads through parts of the buying process, and shorten the sales cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up B2B sites to social media has the potential to be a win-win situation: users benefit when they content more deeply, and engage with your content, and sales benefits when they are handed sales-ready leads who have nurtured themselves through the buying process by actively engaging and interacting with your marketing materials. People want their voices heard - and by offering social media on your site, you show users that you really are listening and responding to their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/457618239" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>The Basics of Content Jacking </title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="restrained_revised.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/restrained_revised.jpg" width="221" height="191" align="left"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There's a new criminal in town, and it's out to get your content! As the web expands, and content creators face increasing pressure to develop new, unique, interesting and accessible content for the masses, content theft increases too. Content jacking is the unauthorized, unattributed redistribution of content from its original website to another site, and content thieves will sometimes post articles without permission, or even scrape entire websites and steal all of the content contained therein. Either way, content thieves break copyright laws and can even damage a website's site rankings or reputation, depending on how they use the stolen goods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his blog &lt;a href="http://www.reemabeidoh.com/"&gt;Social Impressions&lt;/a&gt;, blogger Reem Abeidoh writes about his experience having his content jacked in &lt;a href="http://www.reemabeidoh.com/social-media/keep-your-sticky-fingers-off-my-content/"&gt;Keep Your Sticky Fingers Off My Content!&lt;/a&gt; Having found out his content was being stolen after checking out his Google Analytics data, Abeidoh contacted a fellow blogger, who quickly initiated a campaign aimed at getting the offender (a site called inter alia) to remove the stolen post from his blog. Within a short period of time, Abeidoh's extended online community members had left 15 negative comments on the offender's blog, and stories were submitted to &lt;a href="http://www.mixx.com/stories/374743/inter_alia_rips_off_reem_abeidoh"&gt;Mixx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/inter_alia_Rips_off_Reem_Abeidoh"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; that pointed out the plagiarism and encouraged people to comment on inter alia's site about their cyber crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIchael Stelzner, author of &lt;a href="http://www.writingwhitepapers.com/blog/index.php"&gt;Writing White Papers&lt;/a&gt;, discusses Content Jacking in a post titled, &lt;a href="http://www.writingwhitepapers.com/blog/2007/05/03/contentjacking-the-new-cyber-crime/"&gt;Contentjacking: The New Cyber Crime&lt;/a&gt;. In his post, Stelzner mentions how &lt;a href="The Dark Side of Blogging: Warnings From Leading Bloggers"&gt;an entire article of his&lt;/a&gt; was reposted on another blog. In the comments following his post, most bloggers agree whole-heartedly that content jacking is definitely a crime, although there was no true consensus in determining what should (or can) be done to stop the practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some Content Jackers may unintentionally break the law in their theft (not everyone is familiar with the ins and outs of copyright law after all, and we might extend the benefit-of-the-doubt to some unknowing folks), the practice of Page Jacking is almost always done maliciously. Page Jacking, according to &lt;a href="http://www.abcseo.com"&gt;The ABC of SEO&lt;/a&gt;, is, "the wholesale rip-offs of multiple pages, (and) even whole sites." In their highly informative article titled, "&lt;a href="http://www.abcseo.com/seo-book/page-jacking.htm"&gt;Page Jacking&lt;/a&gt;," the good people who run The ABC of SEO define and really explain what it means, and what you can do, when your website is hijacked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, some nefarious types will redirect websites, so that users land on their site instead of your site, and essentially steal your online presence, search engine ranking, and organically-generated traffic. To do this, the offending site can use a cloaking technique that serves to redirect your site traffic. According to the article, when this is done, you may not realize it unless you notice a drop off in your site traffic or in your search engine results. &lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Role of Social Media in B2B Marketing </title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us who keep an eye on trends in social media, it seems as if EVERYONE is jumping on the social media bandwagon. From Barack Obama and John McCain's use of the technologies in their campaigns, to major IT companies like &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sap.com"&gt;SAP's&lt;/a&gt; social efforts, one might easily get the impression that social media is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="world_background_v-.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/world_background_v-.jpg" width="300" height="220" align="right"/&gt;Social media isn't really everywhere - only 35% of B2B marketers participating in a Forrester Research teleconference currently use social media in their marketing efforts. With so few statistics available to those looking to learn more about social media's effectiveness, and no real way to test social media without investing time and money on pilot programs, B2B firms have little motivation to change how they do business and embrace potentially risky marketing methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/marketing/2008/08/b2b-marketers-e.html"&gt;B2B Marketers Eye Social Media, Web 2.0 Tactics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/marketing/"&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/im"&gt;Forrester Research's&lt;/a&gt; Laura Ramos addresses the various difficulties faced by B2B marketers when considering whether or not they should incorporate social media tactics into traditional B2B marketing campaigns. Using data gathered from 300 B2B marketing professionals, Ramos outlines the 4 main components of social media that challenge B2B marketers and prevent them from embracing social media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Social Media is still only emerging in the B2B marketing space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. B2B marketers don't know how to measure the success of social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Without an easy way to measure the impact of social media, B2B marketers are playing it safe and sticking with what they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. B2B marketers don't understand how their customers are using social media, how their customers might want to use social media, or how to reach their customers and learn about their thoughts on social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have these same issues in deciding whether to incorporate social media into your B2B marketing campaigns? Has your company embraced social media as an effective marketing tool? Have you determined how best to measure the impact of social media on your users, your ROI, your sales and conversions? Do you even know if your customers are already using social media in other areas of their lives, or if they would welcome the introduction of social media tools in their B2B decision making process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's certainly important to ask yourself these questions when thinking about how social media might fit into your marketing strategy. At the same time though, you may not be able to answer all of these questions until you  take the leap and present your users with social media in your marketing efforts. When people are given the chance to participate in that which interests them, they seem to respond by getting involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider starting small - here are a few ways to get started with social media without completely overhauling your entire marketing strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Add tagging or bookmarking capabilities to your website so users can tag, save and share your content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Start a company blog and encourage user participation through comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Allows users to access your marketing content (new whitepapers, enewsletters) vis RSS feeds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Create a presence on social networking sites and invite your users to add you to their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Incorporate multimedia content (such as videos and podcasts) into your marketing efforts. &lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Search and Google Aren't Synonymous</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="search.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/search.jpg" width="225" height="180" align="right"/&gt;There has been quite a bit of disappointment over Google, Yahoo and Microsoft searches, and their agreement in censoring search results as part of China's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project"&gt;Golden Shield Project&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; the Golden Shield Policy is the censorship and surveillance project operated by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the &lt;a href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this policy, some people have ceased their use of Google, Yahoo and Microsoft searches, and are looking for alternative search engines to fill the void. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In complying with the Chinese government's censorship policies, the following appears when a censored term is searched using the popular search engines: &lt;em&gt;In accordance with local laws, regulations and policies, part of the search result is not shown.&lt;/em&gt; (translated). And while the search engines have been censoring their results for several years at this point, the censorship controversy has been in the news recently due to the recent &lt;a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/index_uk.asp"&gt;Beijing Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and the heavy media presence in the country.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Even though the problem encountered by journalists covering the Olympics had more to do with IP addresses being blocked (for "controversial" sites like &lt;a href="http://www.amnesty.org/"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/default.stm"&gt;BBC China&lt;/a&gt;), the renewed interest in China's Internet policies has served to push the search engine censorship issue back into the mainstream. You can read more about what exactly Google (and other search engines) censors in &lt;a href="http://www.diggpoint.com/google-censorship-how-it-all-works/"&gt;Google Censorship - How it all Works&lt;/a&gt;, an informative article on &lt;a href="http://www.diggpoint.com/"&gt;Narender&lt;/a&gt;, an Internet marketing and creation oriented blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've compiled a list of search engine alternatives that can be used as an alternative to the big 3 who operate under Chinese regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dogpile.com/"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="dogpile_revised.gif" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/dogpile_revised.gif" width="150" height="40" align="right"/&gt;Dogpile&lt;/a&gt; is a search engine with a twist - instead of indexing the results for one search engine, it compiles and indexes results from 6 separate search engines to return a robust selection of results. Owned by InfoSpace, Dogpile has been around since 1996, and has won awards for customer satisfaction. Be warned however! The list of search engines that Dogpile uses to compile their results includes: Google, Yahoo! Search, and Live Search. I guess it's not a great alternative if you want to go totally Google-Yahoo-Microsoft free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ask.com/?o=0&amp;l=dir"&gt;Ask.com&lt;/a&gt; is one of the larger search engines, and has been around since 1996. Formerly AskJeeves (home to the online butler who was supposed to answer your questions), the Ask.com algorithm provides relevant search results by identifying the most authoritative sites on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.factbites.com/"&gt;FactBites&lt;/a&gt; has an interesting take on returning search results - instead of simply returning a site's description, it presents real, meaningful sentences related to the topics you're searching about. So instead of simply directing users to the self-created descriptions about the websites they're searching, FactBites digs a little deeper and gives you a more informed look at their results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mahalo_revised.gif" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/Mahalo_revised.gif" width="150" height="61" align="left"/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/"&gt;Mahalo&lt;/a&gt; (which means thank you in Hawaiian), bills itself as "the world's first human-powered search engine," and prides itself on better organizing the information they compile so that searchers save time and find what interests them quickly and easily. Search terms are organized into pages (like Fashion or Gadgets), and sub-topics are further categorized into lists on each main page. This kind of search is great for looking for topics to blog on (something I spend plenty of time doing), or for researching specific products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chacha.com/"&gt;ChaCha&lt;/a&gt; is a potentially cutting-edge earch engine that allows users "to ask any question in conversational English and receive an accurate answer as a text message in just a few minutes." ChaCha is a cool mobile tool, as you send text messages to the engine, and receive responses on your mobile device. Once your question is received, it's routed to the most knowledgeable ChaCha Community Guides (real people!) who are required to pass tests before they're able to work answering queries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cuil_revised_2.png" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/cuil_revised_2.png" width="100" height="54" align="right"/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cuil.com/"&gt;Cuil&lt;/a&gt; is a brand new search engine (launched on July 28, 2008), and claims to be the biggest search engine on the Web. Based out of Menlo Park, California, and founded by a former Google executive, Cuil claims to have indexed 120 billion Web pages - three times more than any other search engine. I checked out Cuil, and while this blog didn't come up in the top 10 search results when I entered the name (Accelerating IT Sales), the user interface is a pleasure, and I could see myself overlooking the ranking issue and giving the engine a fair shake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other search engines out there just waiting to be discovered by those who are tired of, or want something different from Google. You can find comprehensive lists of search engines in this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, including topic-specific and niche engines that you might otherwise never hear about. Happy Searching!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/409650036" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Scrub Your Leads For Job Security</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Email list hygiene - and the specific practice of scrubbing out bad email addresses - should be of the utmost concern for any of you out there who actively distribute marketing materials via email messages or enewsletters. When sending your marketing materials to huge lists that have not been scrubbed for junk, you run the risk of destroying your company's reputation and losing business along the way. And while it would be easy to sit here and cite statistics about email bounce rates, blacklisting and &lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070712/FREE/70712008/1008/EMAIL"&gt;silent deletes&lt;/a&gt; done by ISPs, I think the issue of list hygiene can best be explained by putting yourself in your clients' shoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scrub.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/scrub.jpg" width="250" height="183" align="left"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a third-party email marketer, your clients have placed their trust (and their money) in your business model - they provide you with content, you market their content with a variety of email messaging tools, and you send them a list of names (or leads) who have responded to their content. This method of generating leads is used by all kinds of companies (both consumer and B2B-based), and helps all of the involved parties in achieving their business goals. The client is presented with a list of high-quality, (hopefully) sales-ready leads, and the lead generation company is well-compensated for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mutually beneficial however, this relationship relies on the lead generation company's maintenance of their email lists. When working with a reputable lead generation organization, you should feel confident that the leads they deliver not only meet your specific requirements (such as being from certain geographical locations, or from companies of particular sizes), but that they also come with correct contact information. It's easy to generate 1000 leads, what's more difficult is generating 1000 qualified leads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://www.webbuyersguide.com/"&gt;Web Buyer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, we have developed a lead management system that allows us to scrub out junk leads on the back-end, and therefore remove junk from our lead databases. Before this system was in place, we would unintentionally sell those tricky-to-spot, but poisonous leads with titles like "None of Your Business," and names like, "Mickey Mouse." Since gaining the capability to scrub lists of new subscribers before they even become potential leads however, our rate of delivering junk leads has plummeted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we do occasionally deliver a random junk lead, I always feel bad, and worry about how our clients might respond. And while we never charge for junk leads, I also fear that some clients won't bother reporting their findings (and receiving a refund), and will instead simply choose to stop doing business with our company. After all, if a client purchases 100 leads and 5 are junk, they've potentially been gypped out of a couple hundred dollars worth of leads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From years of experience in delivering leads, I've learned that it's easier to scrub lists when you're not under immediate pressure to deliver your product. By building some sort of system into your business practices that allows you to clean your lists before you're faced with the pressure of generating leads, you are more likely to remove junk that's both obvious (Mickey Mouse) and less obvious (Bart Simpson). Personally, I would much rather ditch the leads on the back-end than lose business by delivering junk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/403220694" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>BtoB Online Goes Interactive with the Lead Generation Guide 2008</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bb-logo_revised.gif" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/bb-logo_revised.gif" width="201" height="100" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left"/&gt;The recently released the &lt;a href="http://www.btob-digital.com/leadgenerationguide/2008/?pg=1&amp;pm=1&amp;u1=friend"&gt;BtoB Online Lead Generation Guide 2008&lt;/a&gt; provides a comprehensive overview of the B2B lead generation industry's recent innovations and upcoming trends, and is published in an interactive format that puts their own suggestions regarding content usage into action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactive guide has a range of features that allow users to search, bookmark, customize, and generally manipulate their experience with the content within. To explain all of the features, the guide contains a &lt;a href="http://www.btob-digital.com/leadgenerationguide/2008/include/mmhelp/mmhelp.html"&gt;narrated tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that points out and explains each of the features available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that &lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/"&gt;BtoB Online&lt;/a&gt; published the guide as more an interactive tool than as a document is interesting, and could signify a change in how content is distributed online. In the past, most similar publications have been offered as PDFs, or made available via a website. In choosing to distribute this guide as a tool however, BtoB Online is signaling the need to produce and distribute content that users can tweak to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By selecting any number of navigation options from the top-of-page navigation bar, users can  select exactly how they want to view and use the content. In addition to deciding how I want my pages to appear (thumbnails or full-size viewing, 1-or-2 pages visible), I can select the "Links" option and see a list of all of the URLs on the page or in the guide! The publication also contains a fairly in-depth search feature, the ability to bookmark pages and have the bookmarks appear in my browser bookmarks/favorites, and social networking functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of a "&lt;a href="http://www.btob-digital.com/leadgenerationguide/2008/templates/send_to_friend?pg=1&amp;pm=1&amp;u1=friend"&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt;" option in the navigation bar is a big step for the B2B crowd which has been slower than the consumer sect in the full adoption of social networking within the industry. By addressing social networking in the very make-up of this guide however, BtoB Online is acknowledging the momentum that social networking has gained in the past year, and invited the use of social networking across the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide can be embedded into blogs as a custom widget, shared with friends via an easy-to-use message containing the URL, or submitted to social networking sites such as &lt;a href="http://www.stumbledupon.com/"&gt;Stumbledupon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newsvine.com/"&gt;Newsvine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://digg.com/"&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt;, among others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new interactive format, the guide also contains a host of valuable information for anyone working in the B2B lead generation industry. From advice on lead scoring and lead nurturing to resources for those looking to find out more about lead management vendors or understand the industry through statistics, the guide is packed full of useful tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/399840682" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Keywords, content and tag clouds</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you seen or heard of tag clouds, yet never been too sure what they are or why they're on so many sites? Have you ever want to see what your website or blog would look like with a tag cloud? I was curious about tag clouds myself - so I did a little research and created a few tag clouds to share on this site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, tag clouds are "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud"&gt;...visual depictions of user-generated tags, or simply the word content of a site, used typically to describe the content of web sites.&lt;/a&gt;" Flikr, the photo sharing site, was the first high-profile website to use tag clouds, while the origins of tag clouds can be traced back to &lt;a href="http://www.coupland.com/"&gt;Douglas Coupland's&lt;/a&gt; 1995 &lt;em&gt;Microserfs&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first site I found was TagCrowd. &lt;a href="http://tagcrowd.com/"&gt;TagCrowd&lt;/a&gt; is a web service that allows you to use their technology to create a tag cloud for any website, grouping of text, or uploaded file. I went to the site and created a tag cloud for this website, and (after a little tweaking on my part to remove some irrelevant words such as "comes" and "permalink," was rewarded with this nifty visualization of the content on this site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.tagcloud-generator.com/index.php"&gt;Tag Cloud Generator&lt;/a&gt; is a free site that lets you create and customize your own tag clouds by adding specific tags, changing the font/background color and the size and alignment of your tags. I like this site - it was easy to use, didn't require that I register, and created a visually appealing cloud tag for this site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.makecloud.com/"&gt;MakeCloud&lt;/a&gt; is another free service that lets you create a tag cloud from any RSS Feed or website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size='4'&gt;&lt;!--tag cloud by makecloud.com--&gt;&lt;script charset='ISO 8859-1' src='http://www.makecloud.com/cloud2.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpipes.yahoo.com%2Fpipes%2Fpipe.run%3F_id%3Dc1200140b57468ebce6488080b551fb4%26_render%3Drss%26url%3Dwww.acceleratingitsales.com' type='text/javascript' &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;span style='font-size: .7em'&gt;&lt;a class='makecloud_link' href='http://www.makecloud.com' title='Make a tag cloud for your blog or website from any RSS feed'&gt;tag cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--end of tag cloud--&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cloud created using MakeCloud doesn't have the same formatting as the Tag Crowd option, but it still expresses the site content visually, and, while there are fewer tags, I thought that most included were highly relevant to the content on this site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a really neat looking tag cloud using &lt;a href="http://wordle.net/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; - you can view it in their gallery &lt;a href="http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/114552/Accelerating_IT_Sales"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Wordle  images are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license, and can be used for any purposes. Keep in mind that if you use a Wordle image on your website or blog however, you must attribute it to Creative Commons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found yet another cool site in &lt;a href="http://zoomclouds.egrupos.net/"&gt;ZoomClouds&lt;/a&gt;. After an easy sign-up process, I was able to create and customize a tag cloud for the Accelerating IT Sales RSS Feed. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the cloud to preview in this post after pasting in the code, so I'm unable to show you the ZoomCloud output, which was pretty cool. You can check it out on their website &lt;a href="http://zoomclouds.egrupos.net/Accelerate-IT-Sales/viewCloud/16330"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in learning more about all of the different kinds of tag clouds you can make, check out this highly information article from &lt;a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/"&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/11/07/tag-clouds-gallery-examples-and-good-practices/"&gt;Tag Clouds Gallery: Examples And Good Practices&lt;/a&gt;. I had no idea that so much went into tag clouds, or that there were so many kinds of tag clouds that one could choose to put on their site until I read this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tag clouds are an interesting way to quickly scan a site to figure out if its content is relevant to your needs. You can use tag clouds to search for topical information without having to come up with specific search terms on your own. Personally, I find tag clouds to be helpful, especially when I'm doing research this this blog. Since I write about so many different topics (social media, lead generation, IT Sales, multimedia content, etc), I don't always know what I'm looking for when I set out to find ideas for new blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/388081080" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Pushing Prospects through the Pipeline</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com"&gt;Marketing Sherpa&lt;/a&gt; report addresses lead nurturing best practices, and is a helpful update on how to best reach prospects once they've engaged with your content, but not independently returned to your site. By applying the practices outlined in &lt;a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.html?id=30757"&gt; Lead Nurturing Best Practices: New Data, Charts, Tips to Put More Punch in Your Cultivation Tactics&lt;/a&gt;, you can align your lead nurturing program with what's shown to be working industry-wide. In compiling this report, Marketing Sherpa partnered with &lt;a href="http://www.eloqua.com/"&gt;Eloqua&lt;/a&gt; (a lead management &amp; demand generation powerhouse) and &lt;a href="http://www.on24.com/"&gt;On24&lt;/a&gt; (a leader in the virtual event and webinar space),  to survey over 1000 marketing professionals to learn about their lead nurturing methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pipeline_revised_2.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/pipeline_revised_2.jpg" width="165" height="249" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the report, lead generation isn't what's difficult - with the general thinking being that most lead generating companies already have plenty of leads, they just don't have plenty of sales ready leads. In order to deliver high-quality, sales-ready prospects to your sales team, you need to put your energies into nurturing your existing leads over the long term, and expect that it will take up to 24 months for some of your leads to turn into sales. To effectively nurture leads over the long term, your lead nurturing programs need to be elevated within your organization, and given the same kind of time and energy that's put into generating leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marketing Sherpa report touches on a few key concepts that I've examined and explained in further detail below:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Best Practice #1. Use multi-media touches to nurture leads &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to effectively reach your prospects, you need to use more than email newsletters or triggered email messages to move leads through your sales pipeline. While email marketing is a tried-and-true method of nurturing leads, you need to do more. According to the report, a combination of email messages, direct mail, and telemarketing efforts works best when trying to segment your leads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to reach people where it counts, you can look to telemarketing as a tool to help increase your brand awareness, determine where in the buying cycle prospects are, and offer educational materials to help further their awareness of your company, products and services. Direct mail is a great way to invite people to virtual and face-to-face events, and remind users of new content or marketing materials they might want to check out on your site. Email marketing is a good tool for drip-nurturing, and can be employed when you have a group of prospects that are actively involved in researching solutions, and want to nudged along with new content or new information related to your offerings. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Best Practice #2. Quick response to Web leads can maximize conversions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our always-on world, it's no longer good enough to wait 24-hours before making contact with a new prospect. With so many competitors vying for the same sets of eyes, it's crucial that you cement your relationship with new leads inside of an hour (!). And according to the Marketing Sherpa data, "calls placed within five minutes of receiving a Web lead have the highest likelihood of making contact." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this kind of real-time responsiveness, you need to move toward automating your lead generation and reporting processes, so that leads land in your CRM system as soon as they're generated. And while moving from weekly lead reports to automated reporting processes might require an overhaul of your entire lead management practices, doing so may also significantly improve your overall sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Practice #3. Use a lead scoring system &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead scoring is a great way to segment your leads and determine how best each prospect should be nurtured through the pipeline. By rating leads based on a series of filters, such as their location, their time frame for implementing a solution, or their role in the IT decision making process, you can place your leads in separate silos, and nurture each group according to their specific needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring is also an effective way to separate the "wheat from the chaff," and figure out how long any given lead should require nurturing before they reach sales readiness. While some leads may enter your sales pipeline with low scores, you can develop strategies for nurturing those prospects and keep your pipeline full as each group of leads receives your messages and moves through the buying process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By scoring leads, automating reporting so that leads are contacted immediately upon entering your CRM system, and nurturing your scored and segmented prospects with a variety of tools, you should be able to accelerate your sales as you continuously move leads through the pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about Lead Nurturing by listening to this podcast from &lt;a href="http://www.theinnovativemarketer.com/"&gt;The Innovative Marketer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://media.eloqua.com/audio/TIM22.mp3"&gt;What is lead nurturing and why should you care?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/378204007" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Optimizing Organic Search Strategies</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="searching_revised.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/searching_revised.jpg" width="163" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"/&gt;While site subscribers are the bread-and-butter for all kinds of B2B organizations, building a strong subscriber base over time is essential to maintaining and growing your pool of leads over time. Organic Search, defined by &lt;a href="http://seo-space.blogspot.com/"&gt;SEO-Space&lt;/a&gt; is the "process by which web users find web sites by a keyword query and click on an unpaid search engine listing," and is increasingly being used by B2B marketers as an inexpensive and highly efficient method of building an audience using existing infrastructure (search tools like Google), and their own content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When making a conscious effort to increase your search rankings and drive traffic to your site via organic search methods, it's important that you consider all of the different tactics required to create a successful strategy. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a relatively complex field, and implementing search tactics that work requires that you do more than simply tag your content with keywords. Search experts, such as the folks at Search Engine Land, have taken the time to compile a list of common mistakes made by marketers when attempting to optimize their sites to generate (unpaid) search traffic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their article, &lt;a href="http://searchengineland.com/080409-100000.php"&gt;Six Mistakes B2B Marketers Continue To Make With Organic Search&lt;/a&gt;, Search Engine Land outlines the most common mistakes made in terms of getting a great organic search strategy up and running.  With a focus on the mistakes of B2B marketers, Search Engine Land  offers tips on how these generally tech-savvy organizations can get their organic search strategies straight. And while inadequate site architecture (which is difficult to correct if you don't have a site redesign planned) tops the list of errors, the other errors commonly associated with optimizing organic search can all be remedied without having to rip apart your entire site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inadequate Site Architecture &lt;/strong&gt;- if you're trying to drive traffic to your website based on specific search terms, you need to make sure that there are landing pages on your site to increase traffic to your site, and "welcome" traffic once it lands. If you simply drive traffic to your site, without tagging specific pages for specific search terms, not only do you lose out on an opportunity to push your site up in the search rankings, but you also lose the ability to effectively track your visitors once they hit your site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lousy Meta Descriptions &lt;/strong&gt;- according to the article, many B2B marketers fail to fill out their site meta descriptions, and when they do fill out meta tags, they often either leave the task to the IT department, or write tags that they understand, but which don't resonate with users. Instead of taking a casual attitude to crafting meta descriptions, it's important to consult with (or hire) someone who understands how to write meta descriptions and which descriptions will attract the most search traffic. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not Analyzing Organic Landing Pages&lt;/strong&gt; - In order to successfully implement a search strategy, you need to make sure that your organic landing pages are attracting the appropriate traffic. It's important to analyze your organic landing pages for, "for all significant, ranking keywords," and ensure that any organic traffic is, in fact, landing on the pages you want them to land on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Monitoring Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; - While pay-per-click search results are generally analyzed at length, organic search results don't always get the same attention. To capture the effectiveness of organic search however, it's crucial that you look at all of the statistics related to your search campaign and analyze your traffic, where it originates from, its bounce rates and so on. By understanding the path that organic search traffic takes to your site, you gain a better understanding of how you can better attract more of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing to Optimize Printed Marketing Assets Before Converting them to the Web&lt;/strong&gt; - Before starting a campaign that's heavy on white papers, case studies and technology briefs formated as PDFs, make sure you optimize those materials for search. While the casual web surfer might not click on a PDF link, a tech-savvy B2B buyer may be specifically searching for these types of materials, and will be more likely to click on them if they come up towards the top of their search. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Duplicate Title Tags and Meta Descriptions &lt;/strong&gt;- If you haven't optimized your site content for search, chances are excellent that you have duplicate title tags and meta descriptions associated with your site. Because of this, your search rankings will be lower, and users won't necessarily be able to find your valuable content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these 6 common mistakes represent just the tip of the organic search iceberg, they present a good place to start when evaluating your organic search strategy.

         <title>Viral Video as a Brand Builder</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;I received an email recently with a link to a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; video that, once I'd checked it out, made me think differently about how viral video can be used to market or promote just about anything, regardless of its connection to the video's content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zlfKdbWwruY&amp;hl=en"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zlfKdbWwruY&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video titled, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY"&gt;Where the Hell is Matt? (2008)&lt;/a&gt;," a young man named &lt;a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/about.shtml"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; dances in 42 countries on 7 continents, and with adults and children, various animals and even fish. He doesn't advertise anything in the video, conveys no obvious marketing messages, and is seemingly unconnected to anything other than himself. At the end of the video however, there is a brief message thanking &lt;a href="http://www.stridegum.com/#/home/"&gt;Stride Gum&lt;/a&gt; for making the whole thing possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to know more, I went to both Matt's site, &lt;a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com"&gt;Where the Hell is Matt?&lt;/a&gt;, and to the Stride Gum site to find out how this gum company is connected to this dancing guy. It turns out that Matt made an initial dancing video several years ago, which was passed around the internet by friends and was eventually viewed by someone over at Stride Gum.   According to Matt's website, Stride contacted Matt and asked if he wanted to travel around the world on their dime and make another dancing video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, Matt isn't chewing gum in his videos, he doesn't talk about gum, and there's no pitch for viewers to go out and buy Stride Gum. Instead, Matt and Stride Gum have produced and released a really cool video that, according to the counter on YouTube, has been viewed 3,250,510 times! Of those 3 million plus viewers, there's no doubt that some of them watched the video and wanted to know how this dancing American and this gum company were connected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sponsoring this kind of video, Stride Gum took a leap of faith that the video would take on a life of its own on the internet, and that (at least in some instances), the company would gain some brand recognition once viewers got to the end and saw Stride listed as the sponsor. I'd never heard of Stride Gum until I watched the video; now I know the name, know what the company makes, and will look for the brand the next time I go to buy some gum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to build their brand by forcing Matt to wear a Stride Gum tee-shirt, by making him chew gum and dance, or by having him shout the company's slogan (The Ridiculously Long Lasting Gum) at the end of the video, Stride Gum let Matt make a message-free video, and counted on the fact that people would want to know more about their company once they'd finished watching. In this instance, less is actually more, and Stride Gum wins by leaving the corporate message out of the viral video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies might try similar tactics in using video to promote their products. While it may seem risky to leave your message out of your marketing content, it could also pay off. If you're considering using viral video as a marketing tool, think about Stride Gum's strategy, and consider creating content that builds brand by making great videos that everyone wants to watch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/364145839" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>The Power of the Olympic Brand</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Beijing_Logo.gif" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/Beijing_Logo.gif" width="200" height="276" align="right"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to brand awareness, the Olympics must be one of the most successful brands of all time. Perhaps we're drawn to the Olympics out of national pride triggered when we listen to our National Anthem during metal ceremonies, or maybe it's the memories we have of watching the Summer Olympics on our summer breaks as children that draws us to the games. Regardless of why we watch, the fact is that over half of the countries entire population does just that. Somehow the 5 rings are stuck in our minds, somehow the Olympic brand remains powerful for most of our nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an article aptly titled, &lt;a href="http://www.mediapost.com/blogs/research_brief/index.php?p=1765"&gt;More Than Half of All U.S. Adults Will Be Watching The Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href="http://www.mediapost.com/blogs/research_brief/"&gt;Center for Media Research&lt;/a&gt;, Scarborough Sports Marketing claims that over 128 million US fans were expected to watch the Olympics Opening Ceremony on August 8. while 67% of those polled expressed having at least some interest in the athletic events. The Summer Olympics rank up there is popularity with the NFL (National Football League, but clearly, you already knew that), and the Winter Olympics - neither of which has the distinction of taking place during the summer months when there are tons of other activities to compete for their attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/hbsp/index.jsp;jsessionid=IUO45NGITB542AKRGWDR5VQBKE0YIISW?_requestid=241439"&gt;Harvard Business Publishing&lt;/a&gt; article by Stephen Greyser, The &lt;a href="http://conversationstarter.hbsp.com/2008/08/branding_at_beijing.html"&gt;Three Levels of Branding at Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, the Beijing Olympics are being dubbed the, "the branded Olympics," and are comprised of 3 separate levels of branding: that of the Olympic Sponsors, that of the Olympic Brand itself, and that of China. Each level has its own commercial pull and recognizability, and each level of branding can draw upon the strength of the other 2 levels in order to exponentially increase the overall Olympic brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympic Sponsors are even given a leg-up in getting their messages across, as the Chinese government has restricted some of the ad space in Beijing to those officially sponsoring the games according to the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/business/media/11adco.html"&gt;Olympic Sponsors to Benefit Under a Tougher Stance in China&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, not all of our attraction to the Olympics is organic - the fact that Olympic Sponsors, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the host country itself are all working so hard to develop the Olympic brand, and associate themselves with it suggests that  we're watching in part because the rings are branded in our minds, and in part because we're being told to do so from all directions. According to the BrandCurve article, &lt;a href="http://www.brandcurve.com/can-the-2008-summer-olympics-break-the-summer-slump/"&gt;Can the 2008 Summer Olympics Break the Summer Slump?&lt;/a&gt;, advertisers are pumping all kinds of money into promoting the games, and NBC (the US television host of the Beijing Olympics) is counting on people to pick up the message and run (to their television sets) with it. Another BrandCurve article, &lt;a href="http://www.brandcurve.com/the-olympics-branding-on-a-global-stage/"&gt;The Olympics - Branding on a Global Stage&lt;/a&gt;, discusses how host countries have come to embody the entirety of the Olympic spirit, and how they use the opportunity to showcase and brand their country, culture, art, history and people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much riding on the Summer Olympics - for the host country, the IOC, the Olympic Sponsors, and of course the Olympians (and their families, friends and training partners), I feel like I'd better finish this post up and go tune into the games myself. After all, you wouldn't want all of that branding to go to waste now would you!&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>So What is a Widget Anyway?</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://widgetserver.com/syndication/subscriber/InsertWidget.js?appId=b5ae0da4-e22f-4889-a4af-5ba013a2fbd4"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;Get the &lt;a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/shoutlist-icons"&gt;Shout List Icons&lt;/a&gt; widget and many other &lt;a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/galleryhome/"&gt;great free widgets&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.widgetbox.com"&gt;Widgetbox&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, you've probably seen and heard of widgets (like the ones above), but do you actually know what they are, how they're used, and how you can use them to attract site visitors and build your brand? As users demand more customizable and interactive online experiences, web-based businesses have to meet that challenge by developing sticky tools, such as widgets, that allow their users to take their online experiences to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI_widget"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a widget is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...an element of a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays information that is changeable by the user, such as a window or a text box. The defining characteristic of a widget is to provide a single interaction point for the direct manipulation of a given kind of data. Widgets are basic visual building blocks which, combined in an application, hold all the data processed by the application and the available interactions on this data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More simply, a widget is an online tool that can be embedded into websites, blogs, and social networking profile pages to share information - such as the weather or news, stream music or movies, display photos, play games, or set up quizzes, countdowns and other time wasters. You can find widgets that allow you to create yourself as a Simpson's character (&lt;a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/simpsomaker"&gt;The Simpsomaker&lt;/a&gt;),  make your own &lt;a href="http://www.buddhahands.com/alternative_healing/fishtank.htm"&gt;Zen Fish Tank Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, and even create your own &lt;a href="http://bunnyherolabs.com/"&gt;Cyber Pets&lt;/a&gt; to hang out on your site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations can also use widgets as part of their marketing and branding efforts; a well-designed, easy-to-use widget can be implemented all over the web, but tracked back to your site and made recognizable with your corporate branding. &lt;a href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?pub=mchang16th&amp;url=http://www.16thletter.com/2008/06/27/anydomainnameyouwant-soon-to-be-available-for-purchase/&amp;title=.anydomainnameyouwant%20soon%20to%20be%20available%20for%20purchase"&gt;Social bookmarking sites&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.furl.net/"&gt;Furl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://multiply.com/"&gt;Multiply&lt;/a&gt; have their own widgets that can be embedded in blogs, you can subscribe to various RSS feeds using their respective widgets, and you can link to popular social networking sites like &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; using their widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating these sticky tools, you make it possible to increase your web presence without having to do much actual work. When users have the ability to add your site to their blog with your widget, your branding is on their site, and you benefit by gaining access to your users' networks. These little icons are a good way to get your logo on your users' mobile devices too - as people use widgets to organize their online experiences. When you build a widget that links people back to your site, you are never more than a click away from your users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by building widgets, you also build the potential to engage and re-engage your users as they navigate away from your site and back to your site using your widgets. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt; article, &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2008/tc20080303_000743.htm"&gt;Building a Brand with Widgets&lt;/a&gt;, widgets are potentially better from engaging users than are more traditional online ads such as banners. By providing a tool that is actually helpful to people, you give them a way to accomplish their objectives and connect back with your brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do develop widgets that lead back to your site, you have to acknowledge that you will not have any control over where those widgets live on the web. People might place your widgets on websites that you would not necessarily want to be associated with, but at the end of the day, the traffic from that site might find its way back to yours and increase your overall audience. Just remember that the more sites your widgets live on all over the web, the more your brand will be recognized and the more traffic you will drive to your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/345088019" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Saying Hello Sets the Stage</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="welcome_revised.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/welcome_revised.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175" height="86" /&gt;Email marketers are constantly working to attract new subscribers, but maintaining lists, developing relationships with new members, and retaining users is equally, if not more important when it comes to creating high-value, sales-ready leads.  To determine how companies welcome new members, &lt;a href="http://www.returnpath.net/"&gt;Return Path&lt;/a&gt;, an email services company, signed up for 61 email programs and examined how they were treated once they expressed interest in a company's offerings by handing over their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their recently published research study, &lt;a href="http://www.returnpath.net/pdf/GreatSubscriberExperiences.pdf"&gt;Creating Great Subscriber Experiences: Are Marketers Relationship Worthy?&lt;/a&gt;, Return Path analyzed their email subscription experiences, and concluded that most email marketers don't appreciate the timeliness and value of welcoming new members to their sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While best practices suggest that marketers should send a welcome email to new subscribers (preferably within 24-hours of attaining the new member), Return Path found that 60% of the companies they tested failed to send a welcome message, and 30% failed to send new members any messages within the first 30 days of the subscriber's registration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ignoring these new members, companies lose the opportunity to engage prospects early in their buying process, and immediately after expressing interest in the company. The fact that someone has taken the time to register for an email program is indicative of a high level of interest, and suggests that they would be receptive to starting a dialog or relationship. Ideally, you want to strike while the iron is hot and send a confirmation/welcome message to new subscribers within the first 24-hours of receiving their data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending welcome messages so quickly benefits both parties too. New members will know that their information was properly submitted and received, will have their subscription data (or a link to their subscription data) for future reference, and will know that their interest in your company has not gone unnoticed. At the same time, email marketers benefit by confirming that their new users have entered deliverable email addresses, by increasing their brand awareness with a branded email message, and by giving the new member an opportunity to immediately engage with additional marketing materials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Return Path study however, it took an average of 9 days for companies to send their first messages after obtaining new subscribers. Once a new member has hit the "submit" button on your site, you have basically been invited to send them a message and welcome them to your site. When you overlook this crucial step, you lose out on quickly segmenting, qualifying and engaging some of the most interested prospects on your email lists. You also fall behind in keeping your brand first-and-foremost in front of these already-engaged eyes, and could lose the lead altogether if they're more effectively courted by your competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the time is now to put in place an automated email message welcoming all new members to your site. &lt;br /&gt;
To learn more about crafting effective email marketing welcome messages, check out this compilation of articles and best practice guides from &lt;a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com/copywriting/list-messages/"&gt;Email Marketing Reports&lt;/a&gt;. While implementing a process to welcome new members may seem simple, remember that the first message most of your users receive may be the only one they ever read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/338429544" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Nurture Leads by Segmenting your Subscribers</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="email_nurture_revised.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/email_nurture_revised.jpg" width="161" height="143" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left"/&gt;A recent &lt;a href="http://blogs.mediapost.com/email_insider/"&gt;MediaPost Email Insider&lt;/a&gt; article, &lt;a href="http://blogs.mediapost.com/email_insider/?p=634"&gt;Elongated Sales Cycles Require Stronger Segmentation&lt;/a&gt; by Stephanie Miller talks about the ever-lengthening sales cycle and suggests that the way to handle this is by segmenting users and marketing targeted messages to small groups. In the article, Miller states the need to pay attention to subscriber behaviors, and direct messages to small groups as they reach different points in the buying process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop a segmentation strategy for your organization, first consider how often users are visiting your site. Miller suggests sending segmented messages to first-time visitors, active prospects and lapsed members, but you can break up your member groups in any way that works for your sales cycle. With IT marketing, you may want to segment according to the number of, or the kinds of engagements members have had with your content. If a group of users downloads two related pieces of content - regardless of the products being offered - you might develop specific category-based marketing messages that provide education on specific technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When segmenting your subscribers, it's essential that you understand user behavior throughout the buying process. By knowing, for example,  that users are more likely to purchase a product if they've checked out a trial download, you can respond to user behaviors with the right kind of messaging. For basic insight into B2B marketing guidelines, industry reports such as &lt;a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com"&gt;Marketing Sherpa's&lt;/a&gt; Business Technology Marketing Benchmark provide a host of insight into user behavior during the B2B sales cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've determined what your users' behaviors mean in relation to their place in the sales cycle, you can develop lead scoring that examines engagements and assigns a score to each lead. Once your users have been assigned scores, you can start marketing to small groups that have shared scores. In using this kind of approach, you are able to automate the process of segmenting users according to their online behaviors, and create messages that meet their targeted needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sending highly targeted messages to small groups of users, it may seem as if you're wasting your time (clicks = revenue), but you actually increase your changes of catching users when they're in need of technical data, a compelling case study or an interactive presentation. Buyers want their buying processes to run according to their own schedules. By paying attention to where your leads are in their buying processes, you come across as being responsive and mindful of your buyers' needs. This kind of responsiveness is highly valued, and users will trust those sending the emails when they feel they aren't being bombarded with ill-timed and inappropriate messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've gained the trust of the user, you can continue to nurture them through the buying process, and hopefully turn your prospect into an actual buyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/331155317" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

         <title>Wireless Social Networking Poised to Take Over by 2020</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="129490_cell_phone_tower_2_revised.jpg" src="http://www.acceleratingitsales.com/129490_cell_phone_tower_2_revised.jpg" width="185" height="247" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.isuppli.com/index.asp"&gt;iSuppli&lt;/a&gt; - an applied market intelligence firm - a revolution in technology is afoot!! In a June 4 article titled, &lt;a href="http://www.isuppli.com/news/default.asp?id=8992"&gt;Wireless Social Networking Revolution Poised to Reshape Tech Industry&lt;/a&gt;, iSuppli indicates that wireless social networking technologies are poised to generate $2.5 trillion over the next 12 years, and that those companies who jump aboard the wireless social wave &lt;u&gt;now&lt;/u&gt; stand to "lead in the technology business," while others may fall behind or become irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the article, iSuppli suggests that, as mobile devices become more embedded in our every day lives, their use as content delivery devices will skyrocket. At the same time, the availability of increased processing power, the expansion of wireless networks, and the ease and speed of wirelessly downloading content will turn the ever-present smart phones, PDAs and cell phones into our primary content viewing devices. And with so many people already turning to their &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/"&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to download videos from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and following friends via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pownce.com/"&gt;Pownce&lt;/a&gt; on their cell phones, it's no big leap to think that these devices will soon become central to downloading ALL of our electronic content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to iSuppli, the impact of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_social_network"&gt;wireless social networking&lt;/a&gt; will be felt across all areas of the industry - from semiconductors and processors to memory/storage capacities, devices and software.  According to the article, as mobile devices are designed to better accommodate social networking needs, "...semiconductor companies will be compelled to deliver highly integrated processors that combine numerous high-performance, multi-threaded special purpose cores."  This means that the expansion of social networking into the mainstream of society and business will generate new business opportunities as companies strive to meet the technological needs of this ever-evolving segment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how are businesses that haven't even integrated mobile content-delivery into their business models supposed to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to building wireless social networking into their organizations? The adoption of new technologies can be painstakingly slow, even among technologically-savvy industries; because of this, companies will have to develop a method that simultaneously incorporates mobile marketing and social networking into current business models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to effectively implement wireless social networking, organizations that are currently dedicated to producing, managing and delivering online content need to take social media and social networking with the utmost seriousness. By ignoring the drumbeat of social networks, corporations signal a lack of understanding in regard to the future of technology. After all, social media and social networking are going to go away. &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12209037/"&gt;The early adopters&lt;/a&gt; have already incorporated these technologies into their business models, and it's time for the rest of us to wake up and start letting our users connect to one another on their own terms and via whatever devices they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AcceleratingItSales/~4/319000505" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
