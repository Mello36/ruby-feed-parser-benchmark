			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in the 8th grade my entire class got the opportunity to travel to the wonderful, Eden-like tropics of Washington DC. Was the Garden of Eden tropical, or was it like my moms garden filled with tomatoes and sweet corn? I have no idea. I&#8217;m not really up to date on folklore. Anyways, this trip was school sponsored, but it also cost money. It was really a perfect situation. I figured it would be me with all the rich hot girls in my class and I&#8217;d finally find out what a vagina feels like.</p>
<p>Much to my dismay not only did none of the hot, rich chicks sign up to go, but all the ugly, poor ones did. I sort of shrugged it off though because there wasn&#8217;t going to be one grown up per hotel room so I figured I could get into some shady shit after dark. The only problem with that, though, was it usually takes me years to convince a girl to even like me, let a lone have sex with me, so I&#8217;d be starting from scratch. That is why I not only brought along a fake Oakley fund, I also brought a hooker fund. Sure, I was only in 8th grade, but we&#8217;re talking hookers here, not exactly moral individuals.</p>
<p>The first day we were in DC we went to some monuments, got harassed by homeless dudes, blah, blah blah, who gives a shit. That night, however, I was on the fucking prowl. I decided I was going to get some action one way or another. I brought along a wing-man just in case hookers got moral all of a sudden so I could stand on his shoulders and break out a tall trench coat to seal the deal.</p>
<p>The first place we decided to check out was the pool area. Right off the bat I got disheartened as every girl there was already on some dudes shoulders. They weren&#8217;t wearing trench coats though, because that would just be strange. I would have ran up, put on my swimming trunks and joined the fun, but I figured if a girl did get on my shoulders I&#8217;d probably attempt to spin her around to the front and I&#8217;d be thrown in jail as a rapist or something.</p>
<p>On the way back into the hotel I heard some &#8220;slammin beats&#8221; and realized that there was a dance club inside this hotel. Only it wasn&#8217;t so much a dance club as it was a fucking shoe box. The place could only hold 10 people, all of which were dudes dancing to terrible techno music. I ditched that place almost immediately and headed toward my last hope, the bar. Isn&#8217;t that where all the whores hang out? Apparently not because it was practically empty except for a couple sweaty middle aged dudes watching &#8220;the game&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was downtrodden. I had no more plans, no more tricks up my sleeve. I decided to catch the elevator and either go back up to my room and jerk one out to Taxi Cab Confessions (if it was a &#8220;good one&#8221;), or go straight up to the roof to jump. As I got on the elevator a girl my age also got on. Without even saying &#8220;hi&#8221; she jumped in with &#8220;you guys, don&#8217;t go up to the 7th floor. There is a girl up there giving blow jobs for $5&#8243;. Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>With absolutely no shame I immediately pushed the 7th floor button and was on my way to my dream. The only thing that could salvage the whole night. A blow job for $5? That&#8217;s fucking unheard of. I could have bought 25 of them while wearing 12 pairs of fake Oakleys with the money I saved from not finding a real prostitute. It&#8217;s weird because at this point I wasn&#8217;t even concerned about looks or how much money her family had. I truly feel that at that very moment I was in love. Even if me and blow job girl got married and she still charged $5 for each one that&#8217;s still an amazing deal.</p>
<p>When I got up to the 7th floor I started to panic. I don&#8217;t know if you know this, but hotel floors are basically just fucking hallways. So unless this girl was blowing dudes in the hallway, or the vending machine nook I was fucked. Not to mention the fact that the first person I saw was a fucking security guard who just stared at me. I awkwardly went to the soda machine, put in a dollar which it of course took 5 times for it to take, and got the fuck out of there and back to my room to watch Taxi Cab Confessions and oh yes, it was a very good one.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to talk to you about groundbreaking, state of the art technology. It seems like just yesterday that I had to hold my breath and look a judgmental, white trash, middle-aged woman in the eye every time I had to buy condoms. This does not have to go on any longer! Part of it is because I don&#8217;t use condoms anymore because STD&#8217;s are like the new Pokemon cards, &#8220;gotta catch &#8216;em all!&#8221;. The other part of it is because of these newfangled self-checkout lanes at my local Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, for a while I was a little weary of the self-checkout lane. I just simply wasn&#8217;t ready to give up dealing with the negative slobs that are the check out people. Seeing how pathetic these fucks lives are really brightened my day. I couldn&#8217;t wait to be regaled with stories about how they were made fun of in school by the jocks who are now 250 lbs, instead of their lean 200 lbs of Miller Light and trucker semen.</p>
<p>One day, however I was feeling a little bit saucy. So much so that I decided that I didn&#8217;t need the usual sob story pick-me-up. Not to mention that I was buying some semi-embarrassing personal products (may or may not be for the aforementioned fun STD collection game). So I figured my best bet would be the self-checkout line because they were wide-fucking-open. That&#8217;s another thing. Out of all the stores in town that could use self-checkouts how is Wal-Mart the first to offer it? Technology of that kind isn&#8217;t usually geared toward the Wal-Mart shopper, who on average has the IQ of a pine cone. Perhaps it&#8217;s just preemptive training for their inevitable future career.</p>
<p>So I slyly took my purchases to this futuristic device. I deduced that if Billy-Bob from lot 9 can figure this shit out I should be in and out of this terrible store in no time. As soon as rang up my first item something fucked up. All of a sudden bells, whistles, and flashing lights started going off. It felt like I accidentally pushed a self-destruct button of some sort. It felt like the Wal-Mart swat team was going to descend from the ceiling by rope in sweatpants and stained polo&#8217;s. I immediately had two employees next to me trying to help me out. The embarrassment level of purchasing these products had effectively doubled.</p>
<p>I found the whole situation extremely weird because all they had to do was cancel my shit and ring it back up. I could have done that myself, as it was my first thought anyways. So when I don&#8217;t really need help they jump all over my shit, yet when I need to find someone to get a video game out of the case for me, the entire staff goes on fucking vacation. To make matters worse I also bought a DVD that just happened to set off the theft alarm while I was walking out so I had to get anally raped by the greeter who had to check all up inside my bag.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point to all of this? Fuck Wal-Mart.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time I take part in a little site called Plurk. If you don&#8217;t know what Plurk is then check out my handy dandy Plurk widget to the right. Basically I write small funny quips daily, and people can comment on them! A lot of people on sites like these are actually pretty cool. I think my awesomeness is like a magnet that attracts somewhat awesome people. I&#8217;m like the center of the awesomeness universe.</p>
<p>That being said there&#8217;s also some fucking idiots that slip through. This is an example of one of them. The first block is my original message and the follow-up comments. The next block is some dumb whore&#8217;s comment she posted on her page that her friends commented on. I usually throw in my two cents at the end, but you people should know how stupid she is and how awesome I am. Plus I really, really like the way she ended it. Enjoy!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>JoshScanlan: Facebook is acting like a suck cocker</strong><br />
GeekLover:	i take offense to that.<br />
JoshScanlan: you would slut whore.<br />
GeekLover: ok, you dont know me well enough for me take that as a joke. too far too fast. goodbye<br />
bumblebunny: What a whore.<br />
JoshScanlan: wow what a stuck up cunt whore slut bitch<br />
bumblebunny: You should kick her kitten off a cliff.<br />
Jertronic: sexy?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>GeekLover: just unfriended a guy who called me a &#8217;slut whore&#8217;.</strong><br />
GeekLover: i mean, geez, i let my friends call me whatever they want, but this guy knows nothing about me&#8230;<br />
passionpartiessays: yeah. that would do it.<br />
Mediafixit: not cool<br />
JustJen: Who the hell?<br />
Singsays: good for you !<br />
TheBadMonkey: woah&#8230; how rude!<br />
MoonFrogMommy: i&#8217;ll punch &#8216;em&#8230;.<br />
NotAPnknN1njawill: throat jab him<br />
horribilissays: that&#8217;s not friendly behavior at all! I doubt if mcCain calls HIS &#8216;my friends&#8217; that. He probably thinks it, though.<br />
GeekLover: hahahahahahahahahahaahahaha&#8230;. that was a random McCain-ism&#8230; where did that come from?<br />
Logics: rofl<br />
Devidose: Meh, some people can just take things too far. That being said, I do have someone I call &#8220;whore&#8221;, and it&#8217;s a term of endearment &gt;.&gt;<br />
Devidose: They don&#8217;t mind @P<br />
GeekLover: it&#8217;s one thing if you at least kinda know the person&#8230; this guy is so self absorbed, he knows nothing of me<br />
GeekLover: hes too busy being an asshole all the time.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally I get to post a normal, straight &#8220;Ask Josh&#8221; question. It&#8217;s nice to know that I have (allegedly) attractive female readers as well. If you just stumbled upon this blog for the first time and want to know what the fuck this is, or if you really need advice about something in your life check out the <a href="http://www.joshscanlan.com/ask-josh">&#8220;Ask Josh&#8221; page.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a straight 22 year old female and I don&#8217;t mean to sound conceited or anything but I&#8217;m attractive and intelligent, yet I can&#8217;t seem to get asked out on any dates. I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s because guys may be intimidated by me. Do you think that&#8217;s the case? If so what can I do to seem less intimidating and if not what should I do?</p></blockquote>
<p>Goddamn it. I really need to get an &#8220;upload photo&#8221; option added to my &#8220;Ask Josh&#8221; page. I have a feeling it would make the answer to this question much easier. Though, I don&#8217;t think I can make that submit photo situation only accept pictures with boobs present. That&#8217;s a million dollar idea right there, someone smart create it, profit off it, and <a href="http://www.joshscanlan.com/donate">donate</a> exactly $1 million to me. If you can do it by tomorrow morning so I don&#8217;t have to go to work that would be great.</p>
<p>On to the matter at hand. This question sounded real familiar to me so I had to do some digging through my mindosphere. Then I remembered an instance where some girl I was talking to online said nearly the exact same thing. Me being the super spy that I am tracked down numerous photos of this girl. Turns out she had the concave boob situation and a glaringly horrendous toucan-like nose. Plus judging from some of her blog posts she doesn&#8217;t know the difference between &#8220;intelligent&#8221; and &#8220;downs syndrome&#8221;. So chances are that your self perception is the exact opposite of what is fact. Just because your uncle raped you when you were 14 doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re a catch.</p>
<p>For arguments sake let&#8217;s say that you do happen to be amazingly hot and intelligent. First of all, call me. Second of all, you&#8217;re probably one of those girls who verbalizes how awesome she is, thinking it impresses people, when in reality it just makes you a complete bitch. The only time it&#8217;s alright to talk about how awesome you are is when you&#8217;re me.</p>
<p>Either way, I have a few suggestions that can help enhance your love life:</p>
<p>1. Start hanging around junior high schools. I know when I was 13 I would have banged just about anything. The only problem with this is that young girls are complete whores these days so the market may be saturated.</p>
<p>2. Get a boob job. No matter how set you are in this area boobs can never be too big. Your boob skin should be stretched so tight that you can actually see the implants. Now that&#8217;s what I call sexy.</p>
<p>3. Become a hooker. What&#8217;s better than banging 5-10 dudes a day and getting paid for it? I don&#8217;t know because I don&#8217;t bang dudes. Sure you could get STD&#8217;s or murdered, but at least you&#8217;ll die rich and that&#8217;s all that really matters.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some extremely odd reason I&#8217;ve been having these weird flashbacks to junior high/high school lately. I think it started one day when I was talking to a friend about how I was awesome at every sport in school (except baseball, which I played for a season and only hit one ball, it was a foul) but only went out for golf. Team sports always seemed kind of douchey to an awesomely self centered guy like me. Anyways, ever since that mini-flashback it opened up the lame nostalgia flood gates. It did, however, remind me of my favorite thing about school&#8230; The whores.</p>
<p>When I moved to a new town, and a new school in 7th grade I didn&#8217;t know what expect. It was a tiny town so coming from much bigger town I naturally expected to be the god of that school in a day. I also naturally expected to introduce people to hot new brands like Nike and Tommy Hilfiger, since they&#8217;d probably never heard of them before. Much to my surprise I was absolutely correct, besides the name brand clothing thing, turns out they were big everywhere. My very first day of 7th grade in this new school I got asked out by three girls!</p>
<p>It was a big decision between these three girls. There was a super cute and popular one, one that was &#8220;alright&#8221;, and the last one I could probably get to blow me under the bleachers. So in all reality it was between the super popular one, and the whore-ish one. It was a really tough decision. Should I go for instant popularity or instant sucked off-ness? Being the new guy I decided to take my time to make my decision. It was the perfect &#8220;play hard to get&#8221; situation. I was trying to play them off each other with the ultimate plan of negotiating for &#8220;hand stuff&#8221; with the popular girl on the back of the bus. Well, much to my dismay my newness wore off pretty quick and I ended up doing &#8220;hand stuff&#8221; by myself in the shower that night picturing having all three of them at once. I still think I win.</p>
<p>During my 7th grade year I also had a hot, young agriculture teacher who had an alleged history of banging students. This fucking broad wore short skirts every day and didn&#8217;t have so much a desk in front of the class, as she did a table. Every day in class all us boys took turns dropping our pencils on the floor to get an awesome peak at the teachers goods. It was beyond awesome. Now that I look back at this bitch, she reeks of whore. I was even told about a year ago that she knew what we were doing, yet she kept her legs uncrossed! How dare she tease a class of ridiculously horny 7th grade boys like that. If I was strong enough I probably would have raped a bitch back then. I&#8217;d probably lay her head down on that giant papercutter and threaten decapitation while I had my way with her. Then I would have sliced her head off because I didn&#8217;t know how pregnancy works.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that this next girl I&#8217;m going to talk about is in every single class, in every school, across the country. It&#8217;s the gigantic whore who started and continued dating 23 year old guys from the time they were in 8th grade, through graduation. It was fucking ridiculous. The only girl any of us guys had a shot with was banging college dudes. It was completely unfair. The only good part about this whore was that she let all the guys grab her boobs whenever we wanted. Every shop class I would get in about 10-15 titty squeezes. They weren&#8217;t even that big and/or awesome, but they still helped me bring my own wood to shop class every day. Zing! Oh jesus fuck that joke was terrible.</p>
<p>Then there was the out of town girl who moved in during high school. She moved in during a summer and I didn&#8217;t even know about her until she had already banged like three dudes. This girl was fucking insane, but what&#8217;s not to love about someone who says they want to have sex with 6 guys, and blow 9 other ones by the time she graduates so it&#8217;ll be &#8220;69&#8243;, which doesn&#8217;t make any sense because 6 plus 9 is 15. So she probably meant &#8220;6, 9&#8243;.Â  I guess the comma is supposed to represent one of her aborted fetuses. I instantly fell in love. Nothing ever happened with her though because I can&#8217;t not make fun of a whore, which means she ended up hating me pretty instantly.</p>
<p>Looking back I realise that it&#8217;s really a shame that the alleged whores were never whores with me. Sure I could have taken a ride on a gravel road with two of my friends and some girl who was going to blow us all, but what&#8217;s the fun in that? I don&#8217;t want to watch cock, or have my cock watched by other dudes under any circumstance. Unless, of course, I&#8217;m in an all male video chat room and feeling really lonely, but even then it&#8217;s just to hear compliments about how &#8220;alright sized&#8221; it is. Does that make me gay?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember I&#8217;ve always had &#8220;run ins&#8221; at convenience stores. I don&#8217;t know what it is about them, but they always seem to harbor the most odd and awkward situation imaginable. I have actually been amazed at how long it&#8217;s been since I&#8217;ve had an extremely awkward and just plain weird convenience store encounter. Well, a couple of weekends ago I went to a little place called &#8220;Swift Stop&#8221; to get a fruity frosty type thing at about 9pm, and &#8220;it&#8221; happened.</p>
<p>The first thing that seemed a little off about this particular situation was how quiet the whole place was. There were a handful of people present and nobody was saying a word. I swear, the cashier had to have been checking people out in mime fashion. My friend and I actually felt like we had to whisper because of the weirdness. So I got my drink and headed back to the line, where in front of me was some guy paying for gas, and behind him was a skinny girl.</p>
<p>First off, I think the guy paying for gas was on drugs. He said he put $30 worth of gas in his car, and he needed to pay for it. The cashier, however, didn&#8217;t show any pumps having $30 on it. These two disappointments went on for about 5 minutes trying to figure out what the fuck was going on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Guy: I had $30 in gas.</p>
<p>Cashier: What pump?</p>
<p>Guy: I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Cashier: I don&#8217;t show $30. I show one pump with $17</p>
<p>Guy: What? I put in 30.</p>
<p>Cashier: Did you already pay it with your debit card at the pump?</p>
<p>Guy: Umm. No.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Cashier: I only show a 17, and that&#8217;s probably someone else&#8217;s that&#8217;s out there, but you can just pay that.</p>
<p>Guy: But I put in 30.</p>
<p>Cashier: Yeah, but I only show a 17.</p>
<p>Guy: I know I put in 30.</p></blockquote>
<p>I swear to fuck, I about double-punched them in the face, slammed the money for my slushy on the counter, raped the skinny girl in the anal, and stormed out. Oh, and they never did figure out the gas situation, so the guy paid a random amount of money for fake gas and then left. Then the skinny chick purchased only a Black &amp; Mild cigar, which made no sense to me at first, but then I realized she must have a black boyfriend. Which is also extremely weird because I thought they only went for fat broads.</p>
<p>I should probably mention that throughout the entire standing-in-line situation there was a guy walking from the paper rack, to the back of the line every 30 seconds. He&#8217;d pick up a paper he wanted to purchase, get in line, then walk back over and pick up a different paper. This fucking guy walked back and forth no less than 12 times total. It was just creepy. Still though, everyone was really calm and quiet, but for some reason I was about 95% sure I was going to get shot. Any other time if a guy walked in with a ski mask and yelled &#8220;I&#8217;m going to shoot this fucking place up!&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t even blink. But for some reason, the complete silence and weirdness got to me. Maybe it&#8217;s because everybody else must think that this whole situation was normal, like I was in some parallel universe where awkwardness is the norm, and that scared the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Maybe that feeling that I was going to get shot was caused by the next guy who walked in. He was a Jamacian gentleman, who was mumbling to himself. As he was standing in line behind me, some crazy bitch walked in and started giving the Jamacian guy a hard time. Really weird, Jamacian fight.  I felt like I was in Cool Runnings or something. When the lady left, the guy just kept saying things like &#8220;fucking crazy bitch, mon&#8221;.  I felt kind of bad for the guy actually, because I&#8217;m pretty sure that lady had a cock and if she did, she probably knew how to use it. I felt like bonding with the guy, because I&#8217;ve had my fair share of crazy bitch situations as well. I turned to him and said &#8220;Aww, Jamakes, it&#8217;ll be alright buddy. Do you want to be friends?&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;m just kidding, I make a point to never talk to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">blacks</span> strangers.</p>
<p>Luckily I got out of that place alive, but I&#8217;d be lying if I said I didn&#8217;t sprint to the closest door with my arms flailing over my head after I paid. It&#8217;s a shame the convenience store trip took so long, because my friend and I had big plans that night. We were actually on our way to the Wal-Mart parking lot to sit and make fun of all the people who shop there.  So I pretty much just spent the night making fun of fat white people, lonely high school kids, and Mexicans.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, this is just getting fucking terrifying. When I did my last Ask Josh about the gays I didn&#8217;t realize that I was in for an onslaught of gayness. From now on when you come to my website there is going to be a quiz you have to fill out. This quiz cannot be cheated. The quiz will determine if you&#8217;re a male gaysexual, and if you are you&#8217;ll get redirected to The Bible on Amazon.com. Read it and be straight/normal. Actually, the reason I don&#8217;t want gay people to submit questions is because I&#8217;m already almost through the book &#8220;101 Gay Jokes&#8221; and I really don&#8217;t know where to take it from here.</p>
<p>Seriously, is it me that&#8217;s attracting all the gayness? If it is I just want you all to know that I wouldn&#8217;t even do a guy, guy, girl threesome with the hottest girl in the world. I want no view of dick and balls in a real, live atmosphere. I will never be caught in a situation where there&#8217;s a chance of me accidentally rubbing against someone else&#8217;s scrotal arena.</p>
<blockquote><p>Greetings Joshua, I just wanted to ask you something that has been troubling me lately. Lately I find myself spending a lot of time online with a man that I have never met. He&#8217;s cute, charming, funny, and he has the same interests as me. I have a girlfriend, but I&#8217;m starting to wonder if I might be gay. What do you think?</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally I figured it all out! After hearing all of these gay people tell their perfectly truthful and legitimate stories about how &#8220;being gay isn&#8217;t a choice&#8221; we have absolutely legitimate proof that it is! This news should make me, and this blog famous! I would even venture to say that this blog will probably be put in history and science books as a real turning point for our culture! I really don&#8217;t care about all of that, but it probably means that I&#8217;ll also become rich, which is the only thing that really matters in life.</p>
<p>As for the question, I think that if you ever refer to a male as &#8220;cute&#8221;, even if it&#8217;s a newly born baby boy, you&#8217;re auto-gay from that point on. However, just to make sure, you could visit one of your local glory holes (like the one in the adult book store at the corner of 5th and Belmont, for instance) and wait for a cock to pop through a hole and see what kind of reaction you get. If your mouth starts to water and your pants get tight, you&#8217;re a gay. If you get disgusted, and your first reaction is to stomp on it with your shoe, then suck the guy off and get the fuck out of there. After all, you don&#8217;t want to be rude.</p>
<p>Next question please&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m head over heels over this guy at work, but everytime I try to talk to him, I get struck with retardism&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know how to get him to notice me&#8230;. and if I do talk to him I end up being mean, like when you are 8 years old and you are really mean to the one you like&#8230; what should I do?&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a minute, I thought being gay was a form of retardation&#8230; You mean to tell me that they are two separate things? Oh, you probably mean that you get hit with the other form of retardation, like downs syndrome or something, on top of your normal retard activity. That would make more sense. You gays are fucking confusing with your word play and how anything I say can apparently be turned around to sound like I want to blow a tranny.</p>
<p>My first instinct is that the guy you have this &#8220;thing&#8221; for isn&#8217;t gay at all. How did I come to this conclusion? I&#8217;m glad you asked. You see, you mentioned that you turn into an asshole whenever you&#8217;re around him. If he was gay he&#8217;d be all over you because the gays are absolutely obsessed with assholes. Or maybe he is gay, but he&#8217;s not into ass play at all, so try acting like a dick instead.</p>
<p>That concludes this &#8220;Ask Josh&#8221; session. If you have any straight, completely normal life questions that you want to be answered from a trained(ish) professional check out the <a href="http://www.joshscanlan.com/ask-josh">Ask Josh</a> page for more details!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m so excited right now! These are the types of moments that I absolutely live for. I got my first legitimately offended reader! Total hate mail type situation about my last Ask Josh! I&#8217;d be lying to you all if I said I wasn&#8217;t at least half hard at all times during our brief email conversation. So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll post the messages we sent each other back and forth and comment on them along the way. I may even give this cunt an actual reason to be offended. Though, I&#8217;m pretty sure that last sentence would suffice.</p>
<blockquote><p>echo said:<br />
i couldn&#8217;t tell if you meant the things you said about gay people or if you were joking and making fun of people with those attitudes. or if you really meant it but will say it is a joke if someone asks you. the comment and question from the guy who wanted to come out to his parents was perfectly clear and understandable. and i found it curious that you felt the need to specify the race of the person who asked you that other question. do you have racial attitudes also?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m a racist homophobe. You caught me. I disguise this racism and homophobic behavior by talking about it on a blog, and masking it with humor. There is absolutely no reason to email the person, whose work you stumble across, because you don&#8217;t fucking understand it. &#8220;Well, I just wanted to email and tell you that I think you&#8217;re completely wrong and that racism is still a big deal&#8230;&#8221; shut the fuck up. You&#8217;re clearly using the internet to come across people that you can argue with to give off the illusion that you&#8217;re smart, and better than everyone else, which is weird because the only way you come off is as an ugly girl, who couldn&#8217;t get a boyfriend and grew up increasingly bitter, and jealous of everyone else&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>In fact, the only person who has a reason to be offended is the &#8220;gay black&#8221; gentleman who sent me the question and who I made fun of. Do you want to know his response to my last Ask Josh? &#8220;Haha Hilarious!&#8221; That was his response. But no, some random white girl was offended. Funny how that works. That&#8217;s exactly what I said in my response, by the way.</p>
<p>It goes on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>echo said:<br />
i don&#8217;t know you , so i thought i would ask. it&#8217;s just that the depressing fact is that more people have these attitudes than one would like to think in these quasi-enlightened times. i just heard that a congressman referred to Obama and his wife as &#8220;uppity&#8221;. and since i don&#8217;t know you, it was hard to tell. it wasn&#8217;t that i couldn&#8217;t tell you were joking, it was that that often disguises racism as it purports to pass it off as a joke. i get very downhearted about these things. primarily prejudices and magical thinking (belief in god), and then the lack of cleverness and art in people. i keep hoping to find people without the former, and some measure of the latter.</p>
<p>Josh said:<br />
At first I thought you might be legitimately offended&#8230; Turns out you&#8217;re just lonely and bored.</p>
<p>echo said:<br />
at first i thought you might be a reasonably decent person. turns out you&#8217;re just another asshole. i was suspicious of you having these attitudes even though they were cloaked in humor. i almost deleted you, but as i said, i thought i&#8217;d ask. perhaps i was misinterpreting. now i see many more flaws that cannot be excused. that was callous and hurtful. not to mention that you don&#8217;t seem to get what i&#8217;m saying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your first solid, and completely legitimate point! I&#8217;m an asshole! I&#8217;m actually really glad she pointed this out because I&#8217;ve worked far too hard for my entire life to get to this level of asshole. So thank you for noticing.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&#8217;t get what you&#8217;re saying because you&#8217;re not really saying anything at all. You&#8217;re all over the fucking place in your replies. Then you bring up Obama, and religion for no point at all except to hopefully have one of those topics spark up an anger in me enough to reply and get into some sort of internet debate. I even looked at her groups she&#8217;s started on Virb and they were basically argument based. Even when someone agrees with her on a topic she somehow finds a way to argue about it&#8230; Yet, I&#8217;m the asshole.</p>
<p>In all honesty there have been more replies since the last one, but it&#8217;s just more of the same. Apparently I&#8217;m stupid, I&#8217;m not funny or witty, I&#8217;m not awesome, my existence tortures her, and on down the line of &#8220;every thing you think you are you really aren&#8217;t&#8221; type of comebacks.</p>
<p>So what am I going to do about this situation? Well since all she wants to do is argue with everyone I would be a fool to keep playing back at her with my slew of awesomeness and insults. I&#8217;ll do what my mother taught me and kill her with kindness. Since she can&#8217;t stand my existence it&#8217;ll be my job to send her a message every morning that says something like &#8220;Hope you&#8217;re having a fantastic day my love! xoxoxo&#8221;. Or &#8220;I just dreamed that we were married last night, I can&#8217;t wait till it really happens!&#8221; You know, your basic weird, stalker-like harassment, since that&#8217;s what any girl I&#8217;ve ever talked to says I&#8217;m best at.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, it&#8217;s time for this Ask Josh thing again. If you&#8217;re new and don&#8217;t know what this is, it&#8217;s a little segment I do to help society. People ask me their serious life questions, and I do my best to give them the most outstanding advice ever. If you have a question check out the &#8220;<a href="http://www.joshscanlan.com/ask-josh" target="_blank">Ask Josh</a>&#8221; page for more details.</p>
<p>This week it&#8217;s all about the gays. It&#8217;s weird because I also have another Ask Josh question I&#8217;ll do later that&#8217;s gay related. I just want to state, for the record, that at no point am I going to be posting pictures of myself without a shirt on. There, I think I just prevented any more gay questions from coming in. Also, maybe I should stop saying the word &#8220;cock&#8221; so much&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>I am gay. I&#8217;m not too sure how you feel about gay people other than our &#8220;disgustingness&#8221;, but whatever; your opinion is your own. Yes, so I am gay, but not out. Well, out to some (most) people - friends and if a stranger was to come up to me and ask me if I&#8217;m gay I&#8217;ll answer truthfully. The people I am not out to are my parents. I am dead scared of telling my parents I&#8217;m gay. Do you have any advice of how I should go about coming out?</p></blockquote>
<p>I usually make fun of the entire set up to the question before actually getting to the question, but I&#8217;m going to skip that part because I didn&#8217;t understand a fucking word of it. You&#8217;re out, but you&#8217;re not, but you kind of are because you tell strangers and everyone in the world, but not your parents. It confused me about as much as when a gay black stopped me on the street to ask if I was wearing boots. Couldn&#8217;t he just look down and see, or is that some gay code for &#8220;I wanna butt fuck&#8221;?</p>
<p>I think that the best case scenario for you is to have a little fun in coming out to your parents. Here are two ultra easy ways to make it a both fun and completely awkward experience:</p>
<p>1. You go over to your parents house like any normal day. Then you get them both together like you have something really serious to tell them. Then you should say &#8220;I just wanted to let you both know that I&#8217;m a gay person&#8230; Not really, I&#8217;m just kidding&#8230; But seriously I really love cock. I love it in my face, my ass, on sandwiches, any way I can get it, basically.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what this would really prove, but it would make a great story for your next gay convention, or whatever you people have.</p>
<p>2. This one is going to be a little more elaborate, which I know you gays are on board with. You take a video of some dude giving you a GBJ (Gay Blow Job&#8230; I don&#8217;t think they should even be classified the same as the normal, awesome ones). Then you put it as an email attachment to a bunch of fake email address, and your parents email address so it looks like it was sent to them accidentally. For extra awkwardness, while you&#8217;re filming the gross suckage you can say things like &#8220;oh daddy, oh daddy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t you gays supposed to be all loud and proud with your &#8220;I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m queer&#8221; attitude? For being a gay guy you&#8217;re kind of a pussy, which is weird because I thought you guys hated the stuff. Maybe that&#8217;s how homosexuality came to be, all the normal love of pussy got redirected to a different area of your brain so you just act like one, instead of dreaming about them constantly. Damn, I knew I should have become a doctor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really quite depressing for me that I have no hot female fans sending in boob pictures and offers of sexual acts, but what I do have is gay people sending me questions about their lifestyle. I was thinking about putting up a &#8220;Date Josh&#8221; application and go over them in blog format, but maybe I should focus this blog towards the gay crowd since it seems to be going over so well with them. That settles it, coming soon to JoshScanlan.com more glitter, rainbows, and AIDS. Stay tuned!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a secret that I would now like to confess to all who read this particular blog post. It took me 3-4 hours to do the necessary research for this post. Not only that, but now I need to take a shower, I&#8217;m tired, and am completely disappointed in myself. I&#8217;m also slightly concerned that I have an extreme addiction to pornography. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;ve &#8220;been around&#8221; on the internets. Throughout my unending search for only the finest pornography available (that&#8217;s still free), I&#8217;ve come across some terrible titles for porn videos. Sometimes they&#8217;re so bad that they laugh me out of &#8220;the mood&#8221;, for about 15-20 seconds, until I see an ultra sexy title that puts me back into <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">my hand</span> it.</p>
<p>The first one I came across today was called &#8220;Granny Does Tiny Tit Teen&#8221;. While not completely ridiculous and outlandish, who the fuck would watch this? Maybe I&#8217;m just too picky, but I can&#8217;t exactly get into old ladies on flat chestedness. This video sounds like it has the sex appeal of a skunk making love to a truck tire, and the room that it was shot in probably had the same smell. Who goes online for a jerk thinking &#8220;man, if only I could find the least sexually appealing thing to your typical male. Yeah, I want a wrinkly blob going to town on a girl with the chest that resembles a dinner plate.&#8221;?</p>
<p>The next video I stumbled across was entitled &#8220;Brittany James - Little Girl, Big Cock - You Do The Math&#8221;. You do the math? I don&#8217;t even know what that means. I never really paid attention in math class, but I&#8217;m sure if we got to the girl plus cock equations my interest would have been peaked. They must have gone over this the day I got kicked out because &#8220;some day your mouth is going to get you in trouble, Scanlan&#8221;. As far as the equation goes, I&#8217;m thinking the answer is pain and torn orifices. Now that&#8217;s my idea of a good time.</p>
<p>The last video that I found is just completely ridiculous. &#8220;Osama Bin Laden rapes news reporter!&#8221; was the title. When I saw this I had a double-take because it sounded like something I would find in my spam folder. How out of ideas is the porn industry, anyways? Well, I watched the video out of pure comedic interest and it was everything I&#8217;d hoped it be.</p>
<p>It started out with a reporter, who I swear I saw in a girl on girl film a few months ago, saying &#8220;I think Bin Laden is in the caves behind me&#8221;. Then an Osama henchman runs out with a gun and captures her while the cameraman just stands there, films it and says nothing. As soon as the reporter enters the cave, horribly fake beards and demonic groaning ensue. After they are done &#8220;planting the seed of Allah in the infidel&#8221; American troops come in and bust the Bin Laden crew. Then of course she has to repay the troops for rescuing her and keeping us all safe. It&#8217;s weird, because it was exactly how I pictured the capture going down. In fact it seemed so true to life that I thought it was a documentary&#8230; A very hot documentary that I plan on watching twice daily until it is inevitably taken down by people who are offended. It&#8217;s a sad, sad world we live in.</p>
