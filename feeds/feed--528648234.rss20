<description><![CDATA[<p>I am a bit aggravated at the folks Pepcom who organize and run Digital Experience held during CES. Really aggravating and hopefully phone call with them tomorrow will clear things up but way to much time wasted on my part trying to go again this year.</p>

<title>New Technologies on the Horizon</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>As we get to the end of 2008 the predictions for what will happen next year start coming out.  In the PC space it looks generally like it will be a continuation of the same process we have seen recently.  Die sizes for chips will get smaller, hard drives will get larger capacities, and video cards will continue to increase in speed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/the-hottest-pc-technology-for-2009-492734">Tech Radar</a> have put together a good summary on the main movements we will likely see in the PC space.  Outside of some niche markets though, there is little need for us to have faster computers.  The thrust of the technology change for the general and corporate user is going to continue towards smaller and lower power.</p>

<p>Intel have a new 32nm chips coming out next year with 22nm and 16nm to follow by 2012 and 2015ish.  Given that they are not already touting the power and speed benefits of the new sizes yet, the incremental change in power per watt is probably less than has previously been seen.  A number of new materials have gone into this technology which might be the cause of this, otherwise it could mean that speed and heat advantages from miniturisation could be disappearing.</p>

<p>If this is the case then processor advancement may stall for some time until a radically new technology comes to light.</p>

<p>In the past couple of years the PC has taken a backseat to gadgets in generating interest and entusiasm.  It does not look like this will change in 2009.</p>

<p>Some more detail on the <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/html_tmp/content-view-40519-135.html">32nm chips</a>.</p>]]></description>

<title>New Media Expo sold - Now BlogWorld and New Media Expo</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0066cc"><a href="http://www.blogworldexpo.com/"><img alt="2008blogworld" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/images/2008blogworld_small.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></font></a>First of all congratulations to Tim on his sale of New Media Expo to the folks at BlogWorld. My team at RawVoice has had to really weigh which event to attend and now its a no brainer.</p>
<p>I will be registering RawVoice to exhibit at the event in October of 2009. I really wish though that event was not in Las Vegas again as that is gonna keep some people away. The Podcasting Community is a tight knit group and it is hard to embrace the social aspects of the community in Vegas. </p>
<p>Being a big advocate of blogging in combination with podcasting though this is a great fit and should be a great event. We will have a chance to reach bloggers who have been considering being a new media creators.</p>
<p>I will be reaching out to the blogworld and new media expo team and hopefully we can help them make the event one that the podcasting community will embrace.</p>
<p>Mark your calendars for October 15&ndash;17<sup>th</sup> mine is!</p>]]></description>

<title>Now I Remember Why I Don&apos;t Buy ATI...</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>So I decided I wanted to update my TV Capture card. I use it only for one thing - to capture my camera for live streaming. I don't care about remote controls, I only care that it had an antenna and S-Video input. I got a deal on an ATI Theatre 550 capture card - which is a PCI Express card - And should push the video better than my old Hauppage card I bought years ago. </p>

<p>I have yet to be impressed. </p>

<p>Let's start out in saying I stopped buying ATI years ago because their video has always had problems. I had an ATI Rage 128 card and the performance never hit what I expected. I ended switching up to NVidia graphics cards and never looked back. NVidia has some solid hardware and software that has never really failed me. </p>

<p>But my last ATI card I bought was years ago. Maybe things changed - ATI was bought out by AMD, new technologies and advancements could make things better. It didn't. </p>

<p>I got the card yesterday. I need to preface this by saying it is a OEM card. I was able to download and install the main drivers. However, the other software wouldn't install. It kept telling me I need a specific piece of software.</p>

<p>I went to the webpage and scoured for software. The pages took me from ATI pages to AMD pages and back. When I finally got frustrated, I found the customer support phone number. Only thing was it is AMD's support, not ATI. I called the number and AMD said that there was another phone number, but it wasn't on the website. He gave me the number and said that they were on the East Coast and are closed for the day. </p>

<p>This morning I called to find out what I can do. Instantly after I mentioned the card the support agent goes "This is an OEM version". He then told me that ATI doesn't support and there is no way to tell me who I can get the drivers from. </p>

<p>I was floored. Not the fact about the OEM part - OEM items are sold to companies like Dell to put in their machines. There is usually no support from the main company. I WAS floored that he couldn't turn me in the right direction. </p>

<p>What is more annoying is in this day and age software and drivers don't take up much webspace and could easily be cataloged for customers. So what if it's OEM? Put it all on one FTP site. </p>

<p>I did download some free software that lets me tune into my video feed. When I went to broadcast, the video was latent. When I spoke, the audio came through first, then 2 seconds later the video pushed through. </p>

<p>The funny part is after this guy pretty much locked up his stance on the card, I said "Ya know, I stopped using ATI years ago because of quality and support. I guess things haven't changed". He replied with "Thank you." We ended the call there.</p>

<p>I took a chance at getting an OEM card. Granted, I didn't spend that much, however, when I ever bought other OEM cards I have always been able to find drivers and software and never had a problem. I am switching back to the old card and taking that ATI card back. </p>]]></description>

<title>Mogulus Pro Offering Way to Expensive</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0066cc"><a href="http://www.mogulus.com/broadcast/pricing"><img alt="2008mogulus" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/images/2008mogulus.png" align="left" border="0" /></font></a>This morning I received an email from the folks over at Mogulus announcing their pro-streaming service. When I looked at the price of the <a href="http://www.mogulus.com/broadcast/main" target="_blank">Mogulus Pro </a>offering I just about fell out of my chair.</p>
<p>Their prices start at $350.00 a month with only 25gb of bandwidth allowance, plus if you bust your 25gb cap you will be charged $1.50 per gig. <u><strong>Someone over there is smoking crack</strong></u>. </p>
<p>They must think content producers are stupid. I have used a variety of paid streaming services for about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> the monthly cost they are planning on charging, and have been able to have my own branded player and many of the other options that are offering with this pro-offering.</p>
<p>This is a opportunity for all of those companies that have been streaming live content for years to step up and compete with Mogulus on their pro-offering.&nbsp; I was fully expecting Mogulus or Ustream to come out with pricing that was aggressive, not pricing that is more expensive than many competitors in the space.</p>
<p>They will have to come up with an offering that makes sense. I think in order to get people like me to consider signing up for their pro-service it is going to have to be an offering a monthly price range in the $100-$150 range along with a healthy initial bandwidth offering. </p>
<p>I hope that Ustream.TV does not make the same mistake as Mogulus has made, because it is evident to me that with their pricing scheme they have not targeted content creators like me.<br /></p>]]></description>

<title>Even With Technology, It&apos;s Harder to Work when Your Sick...</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have been beefing up my websites. I also have been working on some external projects hard. But all of that came to a crashing halt last week.</p>

<p>Why? I got sick. </p>

<p>I felt this illness coming down on Monday (Nov. 24th). I didn't think much of it, but after my Podcast on Tuesday, I pretty much knew I should take some downtime and relax a bit while ingesting something like lots of Liquids. (Here is a keynote - If you have a fever and your lips start to dry out quick, you might want to get some water in your system. )</p>

<p>By Thursday I was pretty much on the back and forth thing - Morning I would be OK, but then by evening I was burning up and freezing at the same time. Saturday I had to play with the band and by the end of the 3rd set I was hurting more than I ever hurt before. If it wasn't for the little catnaps between breaks, I would have probably not made it. </p>

<p>Monday - Feeling better but coughing entered into the mix. Still did my shows. Tuesday - Coughing getting worse. Still did my Podcast - then took a 3 hour nap before going to a local Podcasters meeting I started up here. Wednesday - After 3 PM I went downstairs, plopped in front of the TV and stayed there all evening. </p>

<p>Now it's Thursday and although I am still not 100%, I have to catch up on everything I've missed. I planned to post some videos, but they've been sitting on the back burner. I planned a couple GeekNewsCentral Articles, but once again, back burner. Even the contract stuff I do pretty much was set aside as I couldn't focus or concentrate. </p>

<p>The funny thing is that I could have done any of the stuff in question. With technology today I could have laid on the couch and put the videos together. I might not have been able to write the articles, but I could've at least put together some notes. </p>

<p>It's interesting how an illness can debilitate a person. Thinking "I can do it when I'm better", then when you are more level headed you realize how much more stress you put on yourself. Still, when you are sick, you really need to put some attention to getting better. </p>

<p>I am not sure how much longer this will go on. I keep hearing "Everybody's getting this bug". Hopefully it's not something that might warrant a doctor visit. But I do know that it's time to start catching up on my projects or else I might find myself in a hole I can't get out of. </p>]]></description>

<title>Where Will They NOT Sell Advertising?</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>USAToday is reporting on a high school teacher in San Diego, who has started selling advertisements on his test papers in order to pay for printing costs for his class.  He felt it was the only way to subsidize the costs of printing for his classroom; his budget is $300, but his printing costs about $500 per school year.</p>

<p>Most ads, at this point, are pretty innocuous.  Inspirational messages from parents top the list of ads, but ads have also been bought by local engineering firms and an orthodontist.</p>

<p>What concerns me about this is that this marketing gives advertisers access to children.  Our children are the most vulnerable to advertising, without the maturity and life experience to weed out the obnoxiousness that is advertising.  I can block advertising when my kids surf (ad blocker plus for Firefox) and keep the television watching to a minimum, but if my kids are getting advertising at school on their tests and homework papers, I have absolutely no control over that.  While I would trust that the teacher would not allow questionable advertising to be printed on his test papers, when it comes to the almighty dollar, often greed trumps good sense.</p>

<p>I can appreciate the teacher's ingenuity, but I think there is probably a better way.  If he only needs to make $200, couldn't he have had a small class fundraiser that targeted the parents, who should be supporting their kids' education anyway?  I have to think this teacher went too far.</p>]]></description>

<title>Ustream.tv removing critical comments in Messsage Forum</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday after seeing ads injected into my video stream I asked the question in the Ustream.TV forum if there was a way to shut the ads off. The reply was no. The moderator then closed the message topic from further comment.</p>
<p>Seeing he closed the message topic I posted a second message that outlined my concerns and hoped to get a constructive conversation going. Well they not only closed that discussion before anyone could respond they actually deleted the comment in order to stifle debate. This was a second slap in the face.</p>
<p>The question that needs to be asked does Ustream.TV want to have a conversation with it&rsquo;s family of content contributors on their own site or do they want to have the conversation here?</p>
<p>I find it very curious in over 2 hours of viewing shows that are featured on the main page of Ustream.TV that&nbsp;none of those shows has the advertising we saw yesterday popping up. But as you dig in deeper, and leave the front page the advertising is very apparent.</p>
<p>What it appears they are doing, is making the shows on the front page look inviting without the intrusive advertising, and then sticking advertising into the content producers streams that are not on the front page of the website. Good&nbsp;strategy if you do not want to scare off perspective new content producers.</p>
<p>I have received&nbsp;a Twitter from someone at Ustream saying they would like to do a call. I will talk with them but they need to understand that they need to start being a bit more transparent and be willing to take the heat of criticism in their own forums. More as this develops.</p>
<p>To be fair I found out that Mogulus has started doing the same type of ad injection as well. Which really disappoints me that neither of these two sites informed their content producers or have given us a pro-offering that we could pay to play without advertising.</p>]]></description>

<title>Ustream.TV pushing inline ads without warning.</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Revised: </p>
<p>I am leaving Usream.TV as soon as possible. Large in part due to what happened&nbsp;during a live sponsored event on ustream when they started without warning pushing large advertisements into the content stream. </p>
<p>I did not opt into having ads jammed into my viewers face. It was ridiculous. The ads where completely inappropriate for our audience.</p>
<p>I would have gladly payed for a premium service to not have ads forced n my viewers.&nbsp;But now that they have done this without warning I am finished with them they have burned a bridge here. </p>
<p>This could not come at a worse time as I was planning on holding the&nbsp;Podcast Awards ceremony on their service. I will be looking at alternatives today and tomorrow. Mogulus is one possibility but their encoding is not as good as Ustream.</p>
<p>The way they initiated this is wrong. No warning nothing. I understand a company has to make money just give us a heads up that this is going to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sad to think that they would not consider asking people to pay for premium accounts before doing this.</p>
<p>Not only that but the moderator over on their forums closed the discussion when I asked to how to turn&nbsp;advertising off, apparently they are getting some heat over this. </p>
<p>I have been chatting with some of their biggest streamed shows and they are pulling the plug on them as well. </p>
<p>Update: It should be noted that I am not against a company making money after all they have to keep the lights on. What I do take issue with is that the ads that are being pushed into the streaming content multiple times over the course of a hour and taking up nearly 1/2 of the screen real estate. The ads popped up so many times in that the viewers where annoyed. When the viewers get annoyed they leave.</p> <p>When Blip.TV came out with a pro service I gladly payed the $100.00 a year for faster encoding and the ability to have my own branded player without a watermark. They got paid and I got some cool new features. I am sure Ustream.TV is having trouble determining what is a fair value to charge for a pro-service but for many of us our viewer experience if important enough to pay for. If I were a betting man I bet the ads in those overlays do not pay that much. I bet what i would be willing to pay is more than they would ever make in this type of advertising.</p>]]></description>

<title>Palm TREO Pro Smartphone</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="2008treopro" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2008treopro.jpg" align="left" border="0" />The second Palm TREO phone I reviewed is the TREO Pro Smartphone. My initial impression out of the box was that it looked like a Blackberry but thats where the similarities stop.</p>
<p>It was running on Windows Mobile 6.1&nbsp;that was probably my biggest surprise but again I have never used a TREO before so was not aware that they had went to Windows Mobile. The phone I received was connected to AT&amp;T and was very fast when connecting to the Internet.</p>
<p>The phone also&nbsp;is Wi-Fi capable and hooking it to my home network resulted in very fast net access as one would expect. But once again loading web pages resulted in very disappointing results. I loaded at least a dozen of my favorite websites with the built in browser and pages just did not render well as compared to G1 and iPhone.</p>
<p>It really blows me away that TREO has not paid more attention to the web browsing capability. Other phone offerings out there are doing a much better job. The screen real estate on this phone was larger than the Palm Centro but still the waste a lot of space of they worked at it the could have a screen that is a 1/4 inch larger.</p>
<p>The keyboard was manageable, the onboard camera is superior to the iPhone and it also has Video recording capability that in good light turns out well. </p>
<p>Many of the Windows Mobile functions like file explorer and outlook integration was typical of Windows Mobile platform. One thing that I kept having trouble with was that the phone has the ability to go into airplane mode and turn off the cell signal for some reason my phone kept defaulting into airplane mode.</p>
<p>Reception test over a 40 minute call resulted in the phone dropping connections in areas I expect it to drop as has other phones but this phone also dropped connection in 2 new areas that I do not normally loose reception in. While not scientific this 40 minute drive that I do is typically a good indication of how good the antenna is inside the phone. </p>
<p>The unit has GPS support and using Google Maps with the GPS feature worked out well.</p>
<p>Minus the browser experience this phone delivered everything I expected from a smartphone. The phone retails for $549.00 I did not see what price AT&amp;T was charging on a 2 year activation. </p>
<p>My overall experience with the phone was a good one and I could use this phone as a substitute for a G1 or iPhone minus the Browser experience the phone was top notch in features and performance.</p>]]></description>

<title>Olive Green Palm Centro Review</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/centro/index.html"><img alt="2008palmcentro" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2008palmcentro.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></font></a>Having never owned a Palm based phone I was curious to get my hands on the phones that the folks over at Palm sent over. The first unit I tested was the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/centro/index.html">Palm Centro</a>.</p>
<p>My litmus test was how well I could use the phone straight out of the box and in all honesty I was handicapped when I first started using it as I did not know that it was preferable to use a stylus. </p>
<p>After using other phones over the past couple of years that have had touch screens or did not require a stylus I felt this was like&nbsp;a step back in time.</p>
<p>The Web Browser was the first thing I loaded and after loading a web page or two I was highly disappointed as the browser stripped all of the graphics and only showed text. After using the G1 and iPhone one has a hard time going back to this old way of surfing the net.</p>
<p>The interface for navigating standard features like contact list, calendar, voicemail was all pretty standard. But what surprises me about this phone is that they could have went with a bigger screen. Lots of plastic.</p>
<p>During my reception test over a 40 minute drive the phone dropped connection in the same exact locations that other phones I have tested and currently have drop connection. </p>
<p>The keyboard on the unit was a bit to small for my likening but my 12 year old daughter did fine with the keyboard. The camera function was much better than my iPhone and being able to record video was a plus. The unit I received was on the Sprint network </p>
<p>A built in Facebook application surprised me as well as Google Maps which both worked well. The chat function seemed to please my daughter thus it passed the teenager test.</p>
<p>My take away on this phone is that I personally would not want one. But polling my daughter who used it for several hours she liked the size as it was small and she preferred using the stylus on the phone.</p>
<p>Checking the Sprint website they have the phone at $79.99 with a two year contract which makes for an attractive price for a smart phone. See the full functions of the phone at <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/centro/index.html">Palm.com</a></p>]]></description>

<title>HEXBUG Review (A Cool Stocking Stuffer)</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.hexbug.com/"><img alt="2008hexbug" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2008hexbug.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></font></a>About 3&ndash;4 months ago I was exposed to a <a href="http://www.hexbug.com/">HEXBUG</a><font color="#0000ff"> </font>at some event I was at and found them to be pretty cool. So when the folks at HEXBUG sent me a couple to review I thought this would be something my kids would get into.</p>
<p>I am always getting products that I have to tell them hands off as I don&rsquo;t want to have to send a product back damaged. But this time I said go for it.</p>
<p>I received both a Inchworm Micro Robotic Creature and a Crab Micro Robotic creature. The kids had them on just about any flat surface we had here. While my younger son 4 like the Crab Micro my older kids 11&ndash;12 liked the Inchworm Micro the best.</p>
<p>The Inchworm comes with a remote control and they were able to manipulate where they went easily. The Crab Micro fitted the youngest fine as it responds to sounds and light intensity. He had a lot of fun scaring his mom by hiding it under a overturned bowl which when removed caused the Crab Micro to seek darkness.</p>
<p>These would make great stocking stuffers for the 10 and under age group. They retail between $14.99 and $19.00 available soon at Radio Shacks Nation Wide or at Hexbug.com </p>
<p>Notice: Hexbug provided review units all gear reviewed by Geek News Central is used in the real world for at least a 3 day period.</p>]]></description>

<title>Mail In Rebates May Be in Jeopardy</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>First of all I must say: Yes, I am still waiting for my Iomega Zip drive rebate. When I purchased the drive and disks back in the mid 90's, I expected to get $70 back in rebates. I know I'm not going to get that back.. </p>

<p>You might find this happening again, as Florida based Continental Promotion Group (CPG) filled for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on Nov 14th. Since Canon uses CPG for rebates, they alerted their dealers a few days ago of the possible rebate issues.Canon also issued a statement saying they will cover rebates.</p>

<p>CPG offers many different items like rebates, Pre-Paid and Gift Cards, Sales rewards and Sweepstakes. They work with companies like Canon, Home Depot, Bed, Bath and Beyond, WOOT!, Costco, Fujitsu, Logitech, Motorola, Pricegrabber, Samsung, Staples, Westinghouse and XM Satellite. Their list goes on from there, with other companies in 120 countries. </p>

<p>CPG will borrow from some of the companies to get the rebates sent out. You might be a little more weary, though if you are going out on Black Friday for the Doorbuster Days.</p>]]></description>

<title>Take a Nap</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Compelling new research from several universities is suggesting that naps can boost your memory.  Our busy, 24/7 world keeps most of us from getting the sleep we need, and even worse, aging, sleep apnea, or just being a parent can rob you of consistent all-night sleeping that repairs your memory in the slow-wave sleep cycle.  It turns out that it is not really the length of sleep that is important, but the quality of sleep that matters.  Good sleep is better than long fragmented sleeping.</p>

<p>One study taught a group of subjects two-character Chinese words over a several hour period.  At the end of that time, half of the group was allowed a 90-minute nap.  Afterwards, the entire group was tested using Chinese words they had not learned in the previous learning session.  Those who had a nap were able to infer certain characteristics from the characters they learned and actually did well on the tests, while the non-sleeping group failed.</p>

<p>During slow-wave sleep, the hypothalamus is working to repair memory centers that have been used extensively during awake time.  This repair process is important in overall memory retention and mental processing.</p>

<p>I'm a huge fan of naps.  Because I am a mother with children ranging in age from 6 to 18, I am often awakened in the night. I also suffer from intermittent chronic insomnia that comes in cycles throughout the year. I definitely have fractured sleep patterns.  But on the weekends, at least one day, I take a 90 to 120 minute nap in mid-afternoon.  I find it critical to do so, but have never been able to explain why.</p>

<p>Turns out that that nap boosts a special type of memory that allows us to see the big picture and gets us creative in solving problems.  I have always known I do my best writing on Sunday nights when I've had my two-hour nap.  Now I know why.</p>

<p>Susabelle's Prescription:  Go take a nap!</p>]]></description>

<title>My Take on the Justin.tv Suicide</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few days, more information has come out about the teen suicide viewed by hundreds of people on Justin.tv.  The situation is sad, and was likely avoidable, but I'm going to resist blaming the people watching on the internet for letting it happen.</p>

<p>The young man in question, Abraham Biggs, was obviously troubled, and had more than once threatened to commit suicide, both in his real life and in his online activities.  He had even attempted suicide at least twice, but had been stopped both times.  The only people who knew for sure what Abraham was going through was his his own family and those that surrounded him in real life.</p>

<p>While it is tragic that this had to happen with an audience, much of the audience in question had heard the same threats from Abraham in the past, and did not believe he was serious about actually committing suicide.  When he took pills, his viewers didn't know if it was a handful of relatively harmless tylenol, or something much more sinister.  Since there had been such a game of "the boy who cried wolf" about Abraham's activities over the previous 2 years, it is not really all that surprising that people watching his live feed did not believe he was actually going to go through with his threat.</p>

<p>To blame those watching from afar is to misplace our anger.  Those who had the most interest and knowledge about Abraham's condition were his own family and close real-life friends.  Even they did not realize how serious Abraham was, or he wouldn't have ended up committing suicide in front of hundreds of strangers who only had their online experiences with him as background material.  </p>

<p>I agree that it is tragic, and that Abraham should have received the help he needed when he needed it.  But to blame an Internet audience pushes it too far, in my opinion.  How many times are we hoaxed on the Internet every day, by all manner of pranksters with all manner of intentions?  How many articles do we read in any given day that are not accurate?  Most of us take the Internet with the proverbial grain of salt; it is only as real as we allow it to be, and most of us don't give it a whole lot of reality in the total scheme of things.</p>

<p>I feel badly for Abraham's family, and his close real-life friends, who now have to grieve this incredible loss.  I'm sure the people that were watching, now that they know Abraham went through with his threat, are suffering as well.  But to blame anyone in this case is misplaced.  Abraham was responsible for his own behavior, and the final blame for his activities have to fall on him and him alone.</p>

<p>All that being said, if someone threatens suicide, please believe them and get them the help they need.  There are Life Crisis and Suicide Hotlines all over the United States, and if you have a friend, coworker, acquaintance, or family member who expresses thoughts of suicide, then do your best to attempt to get them help in the quickest way possible.  You could save their life.</p>]]></description>

<title>Stop Giving Me Software I Don&apos;t Need</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Every day, it seems, when I boot up my computers, each one wants me to update iTunes and add Safari.  It doesn't matter how many times I say no, and click quit, every day the stupid install window keeps coming back up.  And there is no way to permanently turn this off.  At least, not that I've found.</p>

<p>Java wants to do the same thing.  We cannot run the latest Java here at work because it breaks one of our enterprise systems that are critical to business functions.  Fortunately, you can remove the Java Updater from the control panel on most machines to make the annoying popup telling you there's a new install of Java not pop up every day.  But every once in a while, that updater seems to reinstall itself on my machine and I have to delete it again.</p>

<p>My annoyance today is the Sandisk Cruzer.  It comes with the U3 operating system installed, and self-installs on any machine you plug the device into.  This tiny operating system then gives you tools you don't need, like copy and paste, explore.  On a college campus with locked down computers, these Sandisk Cruzers are the worst for confusing students.  Of course, you can remove the U3 operating system, but it takes several steps and a geekish know-how, so not everyone who buys one of these devices knows how to remove the operating system so it works like a normal thumb drive.  Worse yet, older Cruzers do not allow removal of the U3 operating system, only the newer ones do.  Even a format won't take care of the problem, as the U3 software sits in a hidden file that is difficult to access.</p>

<p>I want software and hardware companies to stop telling me what I need, and trying to automatically install their software into places without my permission.  I want them to stop hiding this stuff, make it an option rather than a necessity, and when I say no, it remembers that I said no and never ask me again.</p>

<p>Much of this stuff is a huge waste of time for tech workers that are just trying to get people back up and running as quickly as possible.</p>]]></description>

<title>The importance of choice</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I got back from holiday this week to discover that the work on my kitchen and bathroom was far from the completed state it was supposed to be.  Considering that we left the house to avoid being without these facilities it is very annoying.  The upshot of this is that the family is now stationed at my father-in-laws house.  This is not a hotbed of new technology.  Until I go back to work and pick up my 3G card I am forced to revert to dial-up for my Internet access.</p>

<p>Just getting online this way proved to be a challenge.  The modem in my laptop has never been used.  Luckily I'm a pack rat so I still had the driver CD in my case.  With the modem making sounds and dialing my home number I only needed to work out what number to actually dial.  I tried calling my broadband provider, no luck there.  I also tried my phone provider as they might have a dial-up service.  They did and would let me use it if I signed up for a 1 year plan at the bargain price of 75 dollars.  Finally I tried my work helpdesk and found that our VPN supplier has a dial-up option.</p>

<p>So with a tortuously slow dial up connection I can only use when no-one wants to use the phone I am effectively still off-net and finding it very frustrating.  It is serving as a great illustration for me though of how our opinions of a situation are affected by the power we have over that situation.  The previous weeks I had been offline by choice and did not feel stressed in the least.  After my first hour trying to get online yesterday and I was cursing and things went downhill from there.  On an objective level I was more connected than I had been, only now my lack of access was not by my own choice.  Maybe I'll leave the family here and go back home.  I'm sure the neighbors will let me use their bathroom.  I am actually looking forward to getting to work on Monday to get an Internet hit.</p>

<p>I did have a nostalgic moment when my father in law picked up the phone and complained it was making strange noises.  Actually he cursed it out in Italian, but it still dropped my connection.  And for some strange reason every time I connect I expect to hear Todd start speaking.</p>]]></description>

<title>Broadcaster Dies on Justin.tv.</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I remember scanning though the uStream channels one night. A young girl, head wrapped in a veil but exposing her breasts to the ustream public. I also remember other issues of questionable content online or even on TV. </p>

<p>Apparently on Justin.tv, a broadcaster was pushed by his viewers to take a high dose of pills. He did so and died. The 19 year old was pronounced by the Broward County medical examiner. </p>

<p>While this is a travesty, it also sounded like this kid tried to do this before. Whether he was looking for a way out via video or not is hard to say. The end result though is all too real.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will not impede on Justin.tv, ustream, Seasmic or any of the other sites out there. Unfortunate as this may be, it was also bound to happen. Hundreds of feeds out there and some of them are not being viewed by anyone. </p>

<p>There should be a way for these companies to monitor what is out there. But once again - hundreds of videos. Some of them are here and gone in a single episode. </p>

<p>In a perfect world this wouldn't happen. We don't live in a perfect world. </p>]]></description>

<title>Tricaster Died Tonight</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well for some unknown reason in the middle of my live recording tonight my Tricaster died. Will be calling tech support in the morning to find out what the procedure is.</p>
<p>I can only shudder to think if this had happened during the 24hr Podcast or the Podcast Awards. I am not a happy camper at the moment.</p>
<p>Update RMA Issued by Newtek and the box is Fedex Overnight to San Antonio. The folks there have been nice enough to do a rush repair. Hopefully it is back in my hands next week.</p>]]></description>

<title>TiVo a Pizza</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>TiVo and Domino's have joined forces to get you your favorite pie without picking up the phone. You will be able to access your TiVo and like a website - order your pizza, soda and sides to be delivered in 30 minutes. </p>

<p>This is not a good move, it's an interesting one. Services through your media box might just spawn some new ideas. Just like Grand Theft Auto - if you like a song, you can get it from Amazon.com. What if you were watching a movie on your Apple TV or VooDoo box and before you order the movie, you get a special on Pizza, Chicken or whatever. Maybe even your movie purchase could mean a coupon waiting at your favorite store. </p>

<p>Yep, the days of the Yellow Pages seem to be numbered. Then again, you might just see THAT on your TiVo or Apple TV. </p>]]></description>

<title>Flip Mino HD Review!</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.theflip.com/store/MinoHD.aspx"><img alt="2008flip" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2008flip_small1.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></font></a>Just about 30 minutes ago the UPS driver dropped me a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/store/MinoHD.aspx">Flip Mino HD</a>. I pulled it out of its case turned it towards me and recorded this video. I then plugged the camera into my USB port and used the FlipShare application that resides on the camera and added a couple of titles to the video and pushed it to YouTube.</p>
<p>Total time to when it arrived to when the video was uploaded to YouTube was just about 15 minutes. More after the video!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Please note that the Video that on my hard drive before YouTube encoding is really nice. Amazing quality&nbsp;for such a small camera.&nbsp;<u>The encoding from YouTube really did not do the video or the audio any justice</u></p>
<p><strong>The next video is the same exact clip but what I did this time was load the original file up in a video conversion program reduced the size from 450 megs to 32 megs and uploaded that file to Blip.TV who then encoded it in Flash. I think the Blip video looks a lot better</strong>. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The new camera is going to retail at $229.00 it can shoot in 720p which is 1280x720 in 16:9 cinematic wide screen. The new Flipshare application seems to do a much better job and even has some basic titling capability. </p>
<p>There is 4gb of onboard memory (wish there was more) and it will record about 60 minutes of Video. Overall Flip continues to hit home runs with these products. While the price point for the HD version has went up. I cannot even imagine this type of quality 4 years ago from a camera that is smaller then my cell phone.</p>]]></description>

<title>Gunnar Optiks Glasses Review</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.gunnaroptiks.com/"><img alt="2008gunnar" hspace="5" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2008gunnar_small.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></font></a>Nearly two week ago I received a set of glasses from <a href="http://www.gunnaroptiks.com/">Gunnar Optiks</a><font color="#0000ff"> </font>that are being touted by the company as being digital performance eyewear. Which as you use them is supposed to relieve a lot of the effects many of us get by sitting in front of the computer for hours at a time. </p>
<p>Testing eyewear can be a very subjective thing so I wanted to really see if I could determine if the glasses were having a positive effect on my eyes over the course of two weeks. My strategy included wearing them for three days straight while sitting at the computer then not wear them for three days. </p>
<p>I kept a log of typical things that happen to me after a day of sitting at the computer. Primarily headaches, dry eyes etc. What I have concluded in my not so super scientific manner is that I had fewer headaches and that my eyes seemed to not be as dry and itchy. </p>
<p>I did notice that while glasses were tinted, that the things seemed just a fraction sharper which was the thing that surprised me the most. The eyewear retails between $90.00 and $190.00 and while I may have been skeptical in the beginning I do think today that this company is on to something. The team behind the product come from the sports eyewear industry. </p>
<p>Here is my advice, if you are suffering from headaches and eye fatigue from setting in front of a PC all day this is a product at least worth checking out. I look forward to hearing others experience with this product. </p>
<p>Please note that I am not making any medical claims, I am only relaying my perspective from wearing these glasses a total of about 7 days over a two week period. </p>]]></description>

<title>Solar Panel Technology Continues to Develop</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>As most of you know, I'm a rather passionate advocate of alternative sources of energy, most notably solar.  A new development from scientists from the Future Chips Constellation (FCC) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York have created the coating using nanotechnology - engineering at the molecular level, to create a boost to traditional solar panel captures.</p>

<p>A non-reflective coating, comprised of seven extremely thin layers, each about 50 to 100 nanometers in height, is made of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide nanorods positioned at an oblique angle.  This non-reflective ability, and the angle, allow solar energy to be captured even at non-optimal angles.  This means that during the course of a day, more actual energy-grabbing hours can be effectively used than with traditional single-layer panels.  In addition, the layers do not have to meet exacting standards of thickness, removing much of the tedious manufacturing that must currently be completed to create solar panels.</p>

<p>I am encouraged that research into solar technology continues.  As each new process and method is developed, we come closer and closer to a real solution that we can all use.  Solar is ultimately renewable, free to capture, and generally non-harmful to the environment in the manufacture of the panels themselves.  Now we just have to get the costs down to something reasonable.</p>]]></description>

<title>Alzheimer&apos;s:  Not Just a Treatment, But Now a Cure?</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Researchers from my own city (St. Louis University) have discovered a particular hormone that, when manipulated, can allow disease relief directly into the brain.  One of the biggest roadblocks to recovering from brain injuries is the blood-brain barrier, a sort of “gatekeeper” that keeps injurious chemicals out of the brain.  Its unique construction also blocks out drugs that might be able to help in the case of brain injuries.</p>

<p>The researchers describe the blood brain barrier as a sort of bouncer at an exclusive nightclub. While the bouncer welcome those on the approved guest list, it looks for trouble-makers trying to crash the party, refuses to let them in and evicts them if they do get in.  The researchers were able to identify the particular bouncer responsible for keeping out the hormone PACAP27, which regulates general admission.  By altering a molecule, the blood brain barrier was then able to let in PACAP27.  The entrance of this hormone allowed repair of damage from Alzheimer's and strokes.  Read that sentence again.  They key word is repair.  That means a reversal of symptoms and damage.  </p>

<p>Right now the research is fixed on mouse brains, but the same principles will likely apply to the human brain.  This research could lead to incredible advances in repairing central nervous system injuries. <br />

<title>Paid Too Much For Your LCD Television?</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The government is levelling fines from three LCD producers, including the venerated LG.  Apparently, LG, Sharp, and Chunghwa all conspired to fix prices on their LCD products, including televisions, computer monitors, and cell phone screens.  The fines total $585 million.</p>

<p>What's disappointing in these types of anti-trust and anti-competitive charges and pleadings, is that the people that were overcharged (that would be you and me) will not reap any of the benefits.  That money goes to the government, right into the general revenue fund.</p>

<p>If this had been a class action suit, we might have all gotten $20 in discounts or credits or something.  But we're not getting anything out of this deal.</p>

<p>Still, I'm glad that anti-competitive legislation is in place, and that those policies are enforced.  At least companies can't get away with conspiratorial price fixing without some oversight.  But I know in the end, we the customers will be paying for the judgment these companies agreed to.<br />

<title>Holiday Toys</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm starting to put my list together for Santa for the holidays.  Yes, Geeks can have dreams too!</p>

<p>Starting off, I've already purchased some things for the kids, including Sansa 8 gb MP3 players.  These sweet little units are as powerful as the iPod without the costly risk of replacement when they get banged around too much.  While I would love to get them all iPods, I don't think they'd survive the hustle and bustle of my teens.  </p>

<p>I, myself, am looking at the new HD-capable Flip camera.  Sweet at $229 and I could have so much fun with such a thing.  I mean, I could do so much important work with this thing.  Yeah, that's the ticket.  The Flip Mino HD looks just like earlier versions of the Flip, only it films in HD.  It shoots video in 1280x720 720p resolution, wider than the previous 640x480 size, and touts one-click uploads to websites like YouTube, MySpace and AOL Video.  You can also upload to Vimeo and bleep.tv, which will actually upload your video in its original HD format.  It also comes with cables to hook up directly to your television!  How cool is that?</p>

<p>We don't do video games, so I'm not looking at anything for the Wii or XBox, but I am looking for some great deals on LCD televisions.  If I can get a decent one for a decent price, that may also be on the Geeky Santa List this year.</p>

<p>What are you looking at for the holidays?</p>]]></description>
