For fun, I thought I'd open it up to our community and ask you - what would you most want to see from us in Q1 of 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting starts at 10am Pacific (70 minutes from now) :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. I know another Linkscape update isn't listed on there, but it is already in the works and should refresh much of the most important content and grow the index size again (no definitive deadline yet, though).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you like this post? &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5724/1/0"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5724/0/0"&gt;No&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOs (I've found!) tend to be quite a creative bunch, both in the type of work that gets done but also in the way that the work gets done. One of the joys of being in SEO is that the tasks that need to be done and the best way of doing these tasks is permanently evolving. The creative urges mean that often when asked to do two similar tasks a week apart, the tasks are done in a completely different way. From a job satisfaction and creativity point of view, this is fantastic; starting from scratch each time on a task means the creative juices can really flow. From a management and consistency point of view, re-inventing the wheel each time is a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business strategy discussions we often talk about wearing multiple hats to help differentiate between the various roles we have to play. In any given day I can metaphorically wear a number of different hats, ranging from my shareholder hat, to my management hat, to my SEO or developer's hat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my management hat on (I picture a bowler hat) I've been trying to get a happy medium between allowing the creative juices to flow freely and being able to guarantee quality and consistency to our clients. It's early days for our more formal processes, and I dare say I'm pushing a bit far towards the consistency side of things, but I thought I'd share a few of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a Products and Services list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step towards the management holy grail of consistent quality is to create a list of products and services that we offer. SEO is constantly changing (and salesmen have a habit of selling anything!) so this list is constantly evolving, but having the list makes our life so much easier in so many different areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sales Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small and growing company it is very tempting to do anything for anybody that asks for it. We all want to be able to deliver exactly what the clients want, but without careful specification and handover between the sales team and the operations team this can lead to poorly defined tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have asked (management speak for &amp;quot;told&amp;quot;) the sales team (in our case, Will!) that they are only allowed to sell things that are on our list. These are the things that we are confident we can really excel at. Every task we sell is taken from something from that list. This means that right from the outset everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet (I'm really getting into this management speak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth mentioning that this hasn't led to us selling things that people don't really want or need. Almost every business and every website is different, so the last thing I'm suggesting is that you just apply a generic product or service to all of your clients' websites. Having said that, when it boils down to it, there are a fairly small subset of tasks that occur on almost every project. Keyword research, anyone? What about a technical site review? To reduce any lingering doubts, we also allow the sales team to list any specific areas of focus or differences from our standard product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spent time working out what we mean and how we go about delivering each and every task. This is the balancing act I was talking about earlier. If this process is too regimented then all the creativity we enjoy as SEOs is lost and you are just following a recipe. If this process doesn't exist at all then the management structure is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating the processes, we have something we can review and adapt over time. When our creativity finds a better way of doing something, we can add it into the process and from that point onwards it improves the product we offer to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that this list is used and is kept up to date we constantly review it. We have a weekly meeting of the SEO team to discuss the various projects we are working on. Each week we review one of the processes and get feedback on ways we can improve it. There are always new &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/tools"&gt;SEO tools&lt;/a&gt; that can make a process better or faster. In theory, the days of people shouting across the office, &amp;quot;Does anyone remember the name of that tool that lets me ...&amp;quot; should be gone, since whenever we find a new tool is gets added to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By constantly reviewing the processes and keeping everyone up to date with the latest tools, tactics and techniques, we are always incrementally improving the service that we offer our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reviewing completed projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone called Guy Bellamy once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hindsight is an exact science.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotes/with/keyword/hindsight/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our project management process we run regular meetings to discuss all the projects that we have completed. We only run these meetings when we have enough completed projects so that there is enough to talk about. The first time we ran such a meeting I was shocked as to how much we learnt. Looking back at a project a couple of months after the work has been completed gives you the ability to see what worked and what didn't. SEO is often about trying something, measuring its effect, refining the process and trying something else. Spending the time to look back over a number of projects allows you to spot trends that you might otherwise miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do projects where you start link building before you fix any technical issues work better than those where the order is reversed? Knowing the answer to these sorts of questions feeds back in to the process documents and will make you better as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only take one thing from this post, I urge you to take a couple of hours out of your day and sit down with your SEO team. Look over all the projects that you have completed in the last few months and dissect and discuss. I guarantee you will learn something interesting. What you do with your new knowledge is obviously entirely up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you like this post? &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5722/1/0"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5722/0/0"&gt;No&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

I don't necessarily agree with the gripes--was content &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;magical in 1999? As far as I can recall, there were hamster dances, dancing babies and Geocities pages long before LOLcats, Rickrolls and MySpace. Sure, there are millions and millions more people online now than there were 10 years ago and there are buttloads more pages of content, but to me, the type and quality of content hasn't changed all that much. You still have news articles and research papers and useful information in one corner, and porn, memes, photoshopped images, and general nonsense in another corner. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why then are so many folks turning their nose up at the seemingly lackluster content that plagues the Internet nowadays and are pining for the days of yesteryear? Well, for one, it's always great to reminisce. Everyone always seems to think that the current era sucks and that the previous decade was fantastic. A child of the 90s will say &amp;quot;Today's cartoons suck! Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs were the best,&amp;quot; while a child of the 80s will disagree and insist that Smurfs and He-Man were the greatest. Some people will cling to Motown while others will swear by disco, yet both will agree that &amp;quot;music nowadays ain't what it used to be.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another reason is that it's easy to point fingers at the seemingly obvious culprit: social media sites. Everyone seems more than willing to kick that mangy dog. After all, if you pull up a site like Digg or reddit and glimpse at the home page, you'll often see silly pictures and inane top 10 lists mixed in with actual &amp;quot;newsworthy&amp;quot; submissions. It's easy for Internet snobs to point at this type of content regularly making popular, sneer and say, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;is why Internet content sucks now.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that social media sites are simply the People's Choice Awards of the Internet. If you're unfamiliar with the People's Choice Awards, good. They suck (see, this is why I can relate to folks hating on Internet content quality). The awards are decided not by movie critics, movie industry union members, or by an academy of voters, they're cast by millions of regular Americans who vote on what they like and don't like. And despite the trove of quality films and shows that come out each year, oftentimes the People's Choice Award winners are mainstream, crowd-pleasing fare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here's an example: in 2007 some notable dramas were released:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Lives of Others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Away From Her&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Atonement&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Michael Clayton&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The above films were critically acclaimed and won several nominations and awards. Meanwhile, what did the People's Choice Awards crown as the top drama of 2007? Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. That's right, a whole year's worth of great dramas were released and the people crowned a boy wizard sequel as the best of the year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, maybe you love Harry Potter and disagree with my example. No problem, I'll provide you with another one. The masses voted Robin Williams as their &amp;quot;favorite funny male star&amp;quot; of 2007. Robin Williams. In 2007. Not 1987 or even 1997--apparently America thinks he's the funniest person of TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see where I'm going with this? As a somewhat snobbish moviegoer, I think the People's Choice Awards is the absolute worst, most &amp;quot;you've got to be kidding me&amp;quot; awards show. Don't get me wrong, the Oscars and other prestigious shows have their fair share of bullshit wins and snubs, but as a whole they tend to recognize quality films and truly talented actors. Nonetheless, the People's Choice Awards exists and it lets the average Joe vote on his favorites for the year. And wouldn't you know it, not everyone in America is a film snob, a movie critic, or has seen 80+ movies in the theater that year (don't judge me and my disposable income). They vote on what they have seen and what they're familiar with, and they vote on what they like; thus, oftentimes mainstream, crowd-pleasing, familiar, or even downright silly (c'mon, Robin Williams?!) choices are made.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which brings me back to social media sites. When you're giving the masses the ability to submit, vote on and promote any sort of content from across the entire web, what do you think they'll do? Sure, some people will want to know about the latest news in the Middle East while others are interested in Obama, and lots of people are are paying attention to recent medical advancements, literary thesis papers, search engine patents, the economy, and other &amp;quot;high quality,&amp;quot; valuable information. And yeah, niche social media and social news sites will have a focus (Digg leans towards technology, BallHype is sports-oriented). But when you boil it down to a fairly general social media site that allows anyone to participate, you're gonna see a lot of mainstream, general crowd pleasing stuff. Pictures you can easily glance at and laugh about. Bulleted lists that are easy to skim and consist of X Funny Nostalgic Things That You Loved When You Were a Kid. Stupid rants that have no discernible point and won't make any sort of positive impact other than the fact that they made you smile or laugh for five minutes out of your busy, hectic day. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Am I a movie snob? Sure. Do I look at the People's Choice Awards and think that the quality of movies and television have gone down the crapper because &amp;quot;America has voted, so surely this must be an accurate representation of what's being made nowadays&amp;quot;? No, absolutely not. Great films and TV exist, and it's easy for folks like me to find and appreciate them. Similarly, great content still exists on the web just as it's always existed, and it's easy to find it if you know where to look. Don't take a cursory look at social media and reduce a vast, entire Internet's worth of content to the stuff you see being featured on Digg, reddit, Facebook and MySpace profiles, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just because the &amp;quot;crappy&amp;quot; stuff now has a magnifying glass being held over it doesn't mean it didn't exist before or that the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; stuff is drastically declining. That's the beauty of the Internet--it's a comprehensive resource created by the people, for the people. For every and all kinds of people--elitists, snobs, dummies, juveniles, women, men, geniuses, liberals, conservatives. And that's the way it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you like this post? &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5673/1/0"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5673/0/0"&gt;No&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Nintendo's internet success is widely accepted yet largely undocumented. The tactics below reveal only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Has Allowed its Characters to Thrive Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="633" height="289" alt="A search for Mario returns more results than a search for porno" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/Google-Comic.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Real Search In Google Reveals That 'Mario' Has More Results Than 'Porno'&lt;br /&gt;
(Results may vary depending on location)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike most other media producers, Nintendo has allowed its intellectual property to be freely discussed and used online. Nostalgia and Nintendo's openness to new technology has created an atmosphere that has allowed the company's characters to grow immensely popular. The example above shows that a Google search for the term Mario returns more results than a search for Porno. This is amazing in a media atmosphere allegedly driven by violence and sexuality. Mario has remained essentially the same non-violent and innocent character that he was 20 years ago, and he has still managed to attain inequitable popularity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Utilizes Its Special Understanding of the Internet Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="578" height="576" alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/Kidgame-Comic.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The company has years of market research and experience in selling to this market. Just like a good web interface designer, Nintendo relies on conventions to make every one of its games feel familiar to its users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nintendo Can Make Terrible Ideas Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="620" height="290" alt="Fusajiro Yamauchi Invents The Wii" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/Goomba-Comic(1).gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/18/numbers-tabulated-wii-predicted-to-overtake-xbox-360-in-2008/" target="_blank"&gt;Data Source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A fat hero with the super power to jump really high? He rides a tiny dinosaur with magic shoes? WTF! Only Nintendo has the video game Midas touch to create gold out of seemingly terrible ideas. With the exception of a few recent game systems, Nintendo has always led the world in video game sales. Now with the help of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/experiencewii" target="_blank"&gt;brilliant internet advertisements&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo has regained its throne as the best video game system creator in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Flies Below the Radar and Creeps in Like a Trojan Horse&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="609" height="290" alt="Nintendo's American Campus In the Heart of Microsoft's Campus" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/Map-Comic(1).gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nintendo's and Microsoft's Headquarters&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nintendo's American Headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington, and are completely surrounded by Microsoft's Headquarters. Its single building is embarrassingly lacking compared to Microsoft's immense complex. The same could be said of Nintendo's internet marketing campaigns.

&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although Mario has gained a dimension (he's 3D now, like you and me), he is still the red overalls-wearing goof that he has always been. Nintendo knows that it has created something worthwhile and has worked hard to preserve it. The same can be said for its website. It continues to be the image heavy eye candy that is has been since 2001. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What with the Thanksgiving holiday, Rand's travel schedule, and my ill-fated (yet brief) bout with the plague, the production schedule in Whiteboard Studios fell a little off-track.&amp;nbsp; The good news is we feel really bad about it, so here's an extra make-up dose of rock 'em, sock 'em Whiteboard &lt;strike&gt;Friday&lt;/strike&gt; Tuesday action for ya'!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week Rand looks at a frequent concern we hear about: Will links from bad sites hurt my rankings?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is generally 'no' but there are some qualifications. Everyone has some bad links pointing to them through no fault of&amp;nbsp; their own. What can make a difference is the percentage of your total links that are &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; and how they point to you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ask yourself this: Does your inbound link profile look like it was manipulated, overly-optimized, and illicitly acquired?&amp;nbsp; If it looks that way to you, it'll look that way to the engines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watch the video for more details on this important topic.&lt;br /&gt;

I realized this when I read Aaron Wall's &lt;a href="http://www.seobook.com/marketing-lessons-google"&gt;Marketing Lessons from Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search marketing leaders demand results, so it's irrelevant that the &lt;a href="../../blog/oh-my-god-search-is-changing-forever-seo-is-doomed-run-for-the-hills#jtc74044"&gt;means of practicing SEO remain the same&lt;/a&gt;. What is relevant is that Google is decreasing the ability of SEO to provide stable, measurable results. As Aaron points out in his post, Google seeks to undermine competing business models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron's written before about how Google has been promoting informational results to encourage marketers to buy AdWords, but I always dismissed that as standard SEO-Wikipedia-jealousy. Of course, Aaron's discrete about the industries he works in (though his frequent mortgage-oriented posts are probably a good hint), so I couldn't compare notes, making it harder to appraise the accuracy of his argument.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Rand's &lt;a href="../../blog/oh-my-god-search-is-changing-forever-seo-is-doomed-run-for-the-hills"&gt;bullet list indicated&lt;/a&gt;, it's not just about demoting e-commerce sites. Consider the effect of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multiple images listed at the top of the search results&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Side-by-side video blocks (from YouTube, naturally), often in the top three positions &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Greater Google Books distribution through Google's search results lately, which has (affiliate?) links to Amazon, Barnes and Nobles and certain other book stores&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;News articles and other Onebox items&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Personalized results making sites that aren't even in the top 100 otherwise show up top 10&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Further personalization of the search results as users manipulate their own listings &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Geo-targeting making results change even within cities and certainly across regions and countries - this is &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;, imho&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Maps featuring all your competition, including those that aren't even online with a website &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is that a number 1 ranking is no longer a #1 ranking. It's a #1 ranking on your computer while you're in that city...until tomorrow when some jerk uploads pictures to his authority site, while you're logged in, as your keywords stay out of the news, and until the next algo tweak decides your link profile sucks ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk scares people sh*tless. PPC &lt;a href="../../blog/the-disconnect-in-ppc-vs-seo-spending"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://seoroi.com/seo-faq/whats-the-roi-on-seo-hint-seo-experts-are-underpaid-opportunity-abounds/"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; most of the corporate search marketing budget cornered because you're guaranteed X clicks so long as you bid roughly the same amount. Plus Google keeps producing 'lite' versions of industry tools that help people optimize their spend (unknowingly helping Google skim part of that back through AdWords, perhaps...)&amp;nbsp; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these changes introduce more risk and more uncertainty into the SEO equation. Not to mention that as people get used to generally relevant results, they stop scrolling and places 6-10 decrease in value to where a 5-result SERP wouldn't bother folks. Thus, SEOs have to compete harder as the zero-sum game divides the spoils even more sharply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's why I couldn't cut a deal with Action Coach, a &lt;a href="http://www.actioncoach.com"&gt;business coaching &lt;/a&gt;company that approached me for SEO services to help them rank in Google.ca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their site is already ranking #1 in Google.com. (Uh, at least when you &lt;a href="http://yoast.com/seo-tools/disable-personalized-search-plugin/"&gt;turn off personalized search&lt;/a&gt; and check the &lt;a href="http://www.nvisolutions.com/blog/seo/googlecom-international-vs-googlecom-usa/"&gt;American - not Canadian - Google.com&lt;/a&gt;.) So I should have been ecstatic to gather the low-hanging fruit and rank them in Canada, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my philosophy towards SEO is that I want a win-win for the client and myself. So if I don't think the ROI potential looks good, I'll tell them. My &lt;a href="http://www.devbasu.com"&gt;Toronto SEO&lt;/a&gt; friend Dev Basu and I were just discussing this last night, discovering that we both decline leads where the search volume is too low to justify the SEO spend. And I'm proud to say that I've always included &lt;a href="../../blog/headsmacking-tip-6-test-with-paid-search-before-you-target-with-seo"&gt;testing with paid search before running SEO&lt;/a&gt; in my proposals. Which is where things stuck, I believe, with Action Coach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search volume for their keywords is dramatically less here in Canada than it is in the US or elsewhere. And while I might be ignorant, I've yet to see research indicating that ROI on a set keyword is equivalent across regions or countries. If anything, AdWords' geotargeting capabilities suggest the opposite.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I wrote in the proposal that I wasn't prepared to take on the contract unless we tested via AdWords first (which, in not responding, it seems they declined to do)... That's not to say there isn't some value in measuring ROI based on rankings, but that's diminishing every day as they fluctuate constantly. It's already &lt;a href="http://www.oilman.ca/sem/seo-forecasting/"&gt;hell to project how your SEO ROI is going to look&lt;/a&gt;, and the trend towards it is only getting worse.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time a panel moderator asks that generic &amp;quot;Where will search be in 5 years?&amp;quot; question, the answer should be obvious: organic will be even more fractured, so therefore you had better be a &lt;a href="http://www.clixmarketing.com/blog/"&gt;PPC Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; by then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. @ Rand - Please don't take this personally. I wouldn't be fortunate enough to do SEO at all if SEOmoz hadn't taught me so much when I was a newb. And I'm fully aware that you're still light years ahead of me in this game, as this &lt;a href="../../blog/8-ways-to-buy-links-without-buying-links"&gt;eye-opener &lt;/a&gt;demonstrated :).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

For many of us that are new to the field, Google has consistently been the market leader and focus of most of our efforts. But&amp;nbsp;this wasn't always the case.

        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as recently as 4 years ago, the market was far more balanced between the major players, resulting in serious attention by search marketers to different engines vs. today's extreme Google-centric mindset. There's a number of reasons we search folks bring up the problem of the Google monopoly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies can dictate pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Google already sets the standard for PPC advertising, but in a future where one engine has 90%+ market share, this power will go up considerably. Even if click fraud rises considerably or Google artificially inflates PPC costs, marketers will have no choice but to pay or go home.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies control the rules&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;Don't like Google's stance on paid links, cloaking, data collection, or algorithmic calculations? Too bad. When there's only one game in town, you either put up or get shut out.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies can (much more easily) impose unfair sanctions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Right now, if you step out of line with Google's guidelines, you can be out of the index or penalized to the back of the rankings. Generally, this power is applied fairly (though not always and certainly not everyone would agree), but a monopolistic environment makes it much easier for Google's web spam team to apply their personal biases &amp;amp; vendettas to websites large and small.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies can make unreasonable demands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Want to be listed in Google's engine in the future? You might need to provide them with some significant data about yourself or your site in order to be included. Sitemaps &amp;amp; Webmaster Tools are the beginning of a path towards information control (as are data sources like Google Analytics, Toolbar &amp;amp; Desktop). If Google knows more than anyone else about what happens on the web, their monopoloy becomes increasingly impossible to fight against.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies are less subject to market forces&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;Nowadays, Google does a fairly good job of staying one or two steps ahead of user demand and feedback, but in a monopoly environment, the incentives to do so are significantly lower. Just look at all the examples of monopolies that, once their market position was secure, became symbols of consumer anger and frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition against monopolies is considerably more difficult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Building a great search engine is incredibly hard, and getting market penetration might be even harder - just look at Cuill (who failed badly on both counts). It's not yet as hard as starting a new car company, but it's getting there (and look how broken the US automotive industry is).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Journalists, bloggers, SEOs and searchers have been noticing that over the past few years, Google has gone from sunshine and rainbows to a corporate, for-profit entity. While, as a capitalist, I believe that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does mean that Google's path towards corruption&amp;nbsp;is on a far more precarious slope. Your data, search history, site analytics and privacy are respected now not just because Googlers think it's the right thing to do, but because it's the right thing for their business. As monopoly looms, those goals diverge and the incentive to &amp;quot;do the right thing&amp;quot; dissipates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an SEO who values not only my personal professional development, but the overall landscape, I'm worried. I believe in innovation, in the power of startups and entrepreneurship to change the status quo and in the value that comeptition brings to any market. Maybe new players can gain a foothold, but with the barrier to entry so high (trust me, building a fresh web index and usable metrics is unbelievably challenging), will there be a chance to break Google's increasing stranglehold? And if not, how do we handle the challenges of a Google-only world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you like this post? &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5705/1/0"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5705/0/0"&gt;No&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The developers and PRO member beta testers have been hard at work prodding, poking and tweaking the toolbar to make sure it is fine tuned and ready for today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="mozBar" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/toolbar/mozbar_screenie.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The toolbar, which we are affectionately calling the mozBar, will reveal many of the link metrics currently only accessible through Linkscape reports, as well as offer quick access to the SEOmoz tools and other sections of the site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/mozbar/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Download the SEOmoz Toolbar Now!" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/toolbar/download_toolbar.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the new mozBar, PRO members will be able to see &lt;strong&gt;mozRank&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt; (mR), &lt;strong&gt;mozTrust&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt; (mT), &lt;strong&gt;Domain mozRank&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt; (DmR), &lt;strong&gt;Domain mozTrust&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt; (DmT), Google PageRank&amp;trade; and the amount of external links for any URL they visit. All without having to click anything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Non-Pro Members can download the toolbar as well. However, they won't be able to see as many metrics as their paying counterparts. (I blame the recession!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, the mozBar offers easy access to all of the SEOmoz tools. For example, clicking on the Backlink Analysis button will send the user to the Backlink Analysis tool pre-populated with the user's current URL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="539" height="433" alt="mozBar and SEOmoz Tools" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/mozBar1.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;All you have to do is click which tool you want to run and...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img width="464" height="269" alt="SEOmoz backlink analysis Tool" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/mozBar2.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Presto! The page is loaded and the fields are pre-populated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On a final and more serious note, all of us at SEOmoz take your privacy extremely seriously. We have put an immense amount of time and effort into creating procedures and policies that ensure users' privacy. You can read more about our plans on the &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/mozbar/terms/"&gt;mozBar privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; page.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape"&gt;&lt;img width="550" height="214" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/linkscape-screenshot.gif" alt="Linkscape Screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, we've included about &lt;strong&gt;38 billion URLs&lt;/strong&gt;, from about 230 million sub-domains (e.g., twopieceset.blogspot.com) inside about 48 million second level domains (e.g., *.blogspot.com).&amp;nbsp; As Live's &lt;a href="http://nathanbuggia.com"&gt;Nate Buggia&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-lives-new-webmaster-tools-more-with-nathan-buggia"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, there's a &lt;a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/11/19/november_2008_web_server_survey.html"&gt;Netcraft survey&lt;/a&gt; which suggests that there are ~75 million &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; domains.&amp;nbsp; So we're certainly reaching a scale which gives us a comprehensive view of the web.&amp;nbsp; 38 billion URLs is not double the previous number of URLs in the index (nearly 30 billion); however, it reflects that we are doing some deeper crawling of URLs and domains we already had indexed.&amp;nbsp; Really, of more interest is that we have about&lt;strong&gt; 450 billion links&lt;/strong&gt;, which is more than double our previous index of approximately 170 billion links.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img width="600" alt="" src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pXAVWfKF9Xktb9sfMEg5CKw&amp;amp;oid=2&amp;amp;output=image" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We're also making the top &lt;strong&gt;3000 links available per URL&lt;/strong&gt; and domain in advanced reports.&amp;nbsp; These links are also filtered so that no more than 10 links from any domain are shown.&amp;nbsp; This dramatically increased volume and diversity of links gives you the opportunity to see many more of the top links along many dimensions (mozRank, mozTrust, etc.).&amp;nbsp; And the anchor text analysis is much more representative of your presence on the web as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To illustrate the variations in our link counts, consider these sites and pages.&amp;nbsp; You can see, almost across the board we know about substantially more links for any site and page, and have used this broader view of the web to update mozRank.&amp;nbsp; The small general decline in mozRank is an indication that we've spread mozRank across more pages.&amp;nbsp; In general we've found a higher correlation in our latest data to Google's toolbar PageRank, when excluding penalized sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img width="600" alt="" src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pXAVWfKF9Xktb9sfMEg5CKw&amp;amp;oid=1&amp;amp;output=image" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img width="600" src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pXAVWfKF9Xktb9sfMEg5CKw&amp;amp;oid=3&amp;amp;output=image" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You should note that because our index has grown substantially, these additional links and changes to mozRanks do not reflect growth in new links, but rather in new links we've discovered.&amp;nbsp; It would be unwise to compare link counts from the old index with counts from the new one.&amp;nbsp; Instead comparisons should be confined to metrics for sites and pages drawn from this latest update.&amp;nbsp; This artificial update effect will diminish as we refine our processes and reach the end of the beta period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How does this benefit SEOs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A bigger and fresher index means:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Greater accuracy in link counts and domains&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Greater representation of what the search engines see and how they might interpret and use the data&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;More accuracy in mozRank &amp;amp; mozTrust, leading to better data comparisons &amp;amp; analysis&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;More fresh data that helps understand what's happened in the recent past&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Up to 3000 links per URL in the report means:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Know about more links that point to you, so you can request anchor text changes, conduct better self analysis, or fix links that are broken&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Reverse competitive strategies more comprehensively to analyze how they're winning&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Find links that you could possibly acquire from your competitors&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Get better anchor text distribution data&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;URL normalization means:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Link counts aren't biased by sites and pages that create duplicates&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Our data is more like the major search engines who also do this stripping and canonicalization&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Limiting to ten links per domain means:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;You can see a wider variety of links from different domains&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;3,000 links will show you at least 300 unique linking domains (often many more)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Here's a quick list of some of the things people have used Linkscape reports for:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Analyze their link counts, mozRank, mozTrust against those of pages ranking above them in the SERPs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Look at anchor text distribution and numbers to see why a site might be ranking where it is for a given term/phrase&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Reverse competitor links to find sources they can get themselves&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Look at the relative value of particular links based on the juice they pass and the quality of their domains/pages&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Compare mozRank to PageRank to see if there is a large discrepancy (often indicating a penalty if mR is much greater than PR)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Use link counts in conjunction with traffic data from sources like Compete, Hitwise, Quantcast, etc. to see how link numbers, mozRank, mozTrust, etc. map to traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Speaking of link counts, there's a lot of ways to interpret links, especially when you're adding them up.&amp;nbsp; Here are a few thoughts about how we count links:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; double count duplicate links from and to the same page.&amp;nbsp; For instance, we don't consider the two links to our homepage in our header and footer as separate links.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We do a great deal of URL normalization.&amp;nbsp; We strip common URL parameters (e.g., SESSID, jsessionid, redirect, etc.) and remove any resulting duplicate links.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; collapse the source and target of 301s, 302s, meta refreshes, etc. for the purposes of link counts.&amp;nbsp; Of course, we &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; pass the properties (e.g., mozRank) of the source to the target. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
That last point has been a controversial design decision and has led to some confusion.&amp;nbsp; To get a full view of links to a page you should run reports for several versions (e.g. www &lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;non-www).&amp;nbsp; However, one advantage to this approach is that it lets you analyze your link profile at a very fine granularity.&amp;nbsp; For instance, we can see who's linking to &amp;quot;http://www.seomoz.org/web2.0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;http://web2.0awards.org&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;http://web2.0awards.com&amp;quot; all separately &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape/intel/basic/?uri=www.seomoz.org%2Fweb2.0"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape/intel/basic/?uri=web2.0awards.org"&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape/intel/basic/?uri=web2.0awards.com"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This helps us to understand our marketing efforts and quantifies the contribution of each of these different URLs which point to the same content.&amp;nbsp; Also if we wanted to remove the 301 and rebrand one of these domains, we have some idea of where we would be starting out from.&amp;nbsp; We do list 301s as single links in advanced reports for the destination of the redirect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, this makes some of our link counts look smaller than you might see from some other tools.&amp;nbsp; Because we're consistent within our tool, you can compare the numbers you see for different pages to get a relative sense of popularity.&amp;nbsp; But you can't, unfortunately, directly compare our numbers to other tools.&amp;nbsp; I suppose this is the sort of thing you come to discover in any beta ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It turns out that most the technological challenges with the back-end revolve not around scaling our data collection, but rather around processing and serving data. So we &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/team/ben"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/team/nick"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; developers have been very busy re-writing our processing pipeline and completely distributing our API architecture, which is why this update took so long to get out the door.&amp;nbsp; You guys probably care about this work because of our substantially improved performance for our PRO toolbar, which we're also publicly announcing today!&amp;nbsp; I'll let Danny tell you more about the toolbar, but both of these back-end changes should support our &lt;a href="mailto:api@seomoz.org"&gt;API product&lt;/a&gt; and help us to provide you with much more frequent index updates.&lt;br /&gt;

We'll probably see quite a few other changes to the product both visually and in terms of the data throughout Linkscape's beta period.&amp;nbsp; Obviously we'd like to continue to improve our coverage of the web while keeping the quality, relevance, and freshness of our data equally impressive.&amp;nbsp; If you have any feedback, feel free to post comments on our &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/official-linkscape-feedback-thread"&gt;feedback thread&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We always appreciate it, and I hope some of you can see that some of your feedback has made its way into this update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you like this post? &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5674/1/0"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/5674/0/0"&gt;No&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
