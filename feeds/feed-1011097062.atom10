That&#8217;s right, one year ago today was the day we picked up Sasha from the orphanage in Cheboksary, RU. If you&#8217;ve frequently this site for long you&#8217;ve probably already read of some of the <a href="http://dadsageek.com/2007/11/27/hannah-has-no-shoes/">other events of that day</a>. But even with all of the adventure and drama that fills our memories of that day we have to look back on it now and admit that we had no idea how our lives would be changed. All our lives. He&#8217;s a little goofy (as his ad-lib pose in the picture here demonstrates) but he rarely ceases to make us smile. I&#8217;m convinced that God has special plans for  Sasha and we are truly blessed to be a part of that. </p>

We were there for about 4 days and this short video is day 1. The trip went very well, thanks in no small part to the Cavanaghs who welcomed Luba into their home and put up with us for the duration of our stay in Bloomington.</p>

Reagan&#8217;s 6th grade choir program. They called it &#8220;Like a Child&#8221; and, once again, Ms. Gray and the rest of the kids have set the bar a little higher. The video is about 30 minutes long. Sorry about that but I wanted to make sure that we captured it all.

It seems that we&#8217;ve had more than our fair share of beautiful days in Texas this year. Of course, that typically means we&#8217;re in for a BLAZING summer. At any rate, we took full advantage of the day.

This was a short performance that Hannah&#8217;s choir class gave for some of the visiting parents. The songs sounded pretty familiar but somehow they managed to add their own personal touch to it.

Here&#8217;s a short video that I took recently of Reagan (our oldest) at one of her 6th grade choir performances. They&#8217;ve all worked so hard and it shows! This is only a sample of what they&#8217;re capable of. I&#8217;ll e posting more in the coming months. Way to go guys!!</p>
