(You can find it in the Reports section of their website) It provides a comprehensive state-by-state look at the impact of chronic disease in America, what will happen if we continue our unhealthy behavior, and charts new courses to save lives and increase productivity and economic growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors don't waste any time pointing out the magnitude of the problem we face. Here is an excerpt from their introduction to the report: "More than half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases. Each year millions of people are diagnosed with chronic disease, and millions more die from their condition. By our calculations, the most common chronic diseases are costing the economy more than $1 trillion annually—and that figure threatens to reach $6 trillion by the middle of the century. Yet much of this cost is avoidable. This failure to contain the containable is undermining prospects for extending health insurance coverage and for coping with the medical costs of an aging population. The rising rate of chronic disease is a crucial but frequently ignored contributor to growth in medical expenditures."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quantify the potential savings from healthier lifestyles and plausible but modest advances in treatment, the authors compared a“business-as-usual” baseline scenario with an optimistic scenario that assumes reasonable improvements in health-related behavior and treatment. The major changes contemplated here are weight control combined with improved nutrition, exercise, further reductions in smoking, more aggressive early disease detection, slightly faster adoption of improved therapies, and less-invasive treatments. The impacts of these factors vary widely by condition—gains against diabetes depend largely on reductions in obesity, while colon cancer advances depend heavily on wider early screening. A complete description of the assumptions on which these scenarios are based can be found in the full report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the seven diseases, the optimistic scenario would cut treatment (direct) costs in 2023 by $217 billion (figure ES-1). And the cumulative avoidable treatment costs from now through&lt;br /&gt;2023 would total a whopping $1.6 trillion. Note that this would be a gift that keeps on giving, saving hundreds of billions annually in the years beyond 2023.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LaQB4zbjRNQ/SUFare_wmsI/AAAAAAAAABs/KM7T6akA42M/s1600-h/treatment+costs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 313px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LaQB4zbjRNQ/SUFare_wmsI/AAAAAAAAABs/KM7T6akA42M/s400/treatment+costs.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278599941356296898" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/feeds/2274592013971229686/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8542654753614847833&amp;postID=2274592013971229686' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/2274592013971229686'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/2274592013971229686'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/2008/12/unhealthy-america-economic-burden-of.html' title='AN UNHEALTHY AMERICA: The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease'/><author><name>Gabe D</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11259593342045567503</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LaQB4zbjRNQ/SUFare_wmsI/AAAAAAAAABs/KM7T6akA42M/s72-c/treatment+costs.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8542654753614847833.post-3110593308531562842</id><published>2008-12-10T10:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-10T10:53:35.414-08:00</updated><title type='text'>California Has a Plan For Fighting Unhealhty Behavior</title><content type='html'>The CA Department of Public Health, through its Network For a Healthy California, has developed &lt;a href="http://www.takeactionca.com/"&gt;Take Action!&lt;/a&gt;, a free 10-week web-based program for employees of California businesses that will empower them to adopt and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Why are they doing this? Consider this quote from the introduction to the Take Action! Program Overview (which you can download by clicking the previous link): &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;California residents have gained 360 million pounds of excess weight in the past ten years, a rate that is among the fastest in the country. A third of our children, one in four teens, and over half of all adults are already overweight or obese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The impact of this extra weight? According to the CA Department of Health, "rates of chronic disease and disability associated with poor diet and inactivity continue to escalate year after year and are costing California $28 billion annually."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Take Action! plan is a wellness plan that has great potential to improve health and productivity because of one key ingredient that many similar plans lack: SIMPLICITY. The plan provides two paths to better health: 1. include more fruits and veggies in the diet, 2. increase regular physical activity. The plan realizes that asking people to embrace both paths at the same time is not likely to achieve the desired outcome. So it simply asks participants to just pick one, and be willing to follow the guidelines in the plan for that path. The plan provides a week by week guideline for employers to maximize the plan's effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in a position to introduce a wellness plan into your workplace, definitely check out  Take Action!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/feeds/3110593308531562842/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8542654753614847833&amp;postID=3110593308531562842' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/3110593308531562842'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/3110593308531562842'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/2008/12/california-has-plan-for-fighting.html' title='California Has a Plan For Fighting Unhealhty Behavior'/><author><name>Gabe D</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11259593342045567503</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8542654753614847833.post-2649202604978741573</id><published>2008-12-04T17:04:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-04T17:24:27.159-08:00</updated><title type='text'>How's This For Unhealthy Behavior?</title><content type='html'>Dr. Stanley Feld M.D.,FACP,MACE over at &lt;a href="http://stanleyfeldmdmace.typepad.com/repairing_the_healthcare_/2008/11/war-on-obesity-part-12.html"&gt;Repairing The Healthcare System&lt;/a&gt; has be posting a multi-part series on the war on obesity.

Basically the study points out that over-reliance on web-based content for self-diagnosis can be just as unhealthy as not taking any interest in symptoms of possible illness. The study suggests that self-diagnosis by search engine frequently leads searchers to conclude the worst about what ails them. They found that searching for a particular symptom such as "headache" could just as easily lead people to pages describing a serious condition such as brain tumor, as those describing a benign condition such as caffeine withdrawal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that the researchers see is that current search engine technology  is unable to  prioritize results most likely to be relevant to the searcher's  intent. A better alternative could be provided by a personal health record that can provide health advice based on an individual's actual health history. By using the PHR as the first point of inquiry  about a health question, it could be possible to use the person's health profile as a filter to present information relevant to their current health condition.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/feeds/1546126047469615614/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8542654753614847833&amp;postID=1546126047469615614' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/1546126047469615614'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/1546126047469615614'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/2008/12/microsoft-examines-cyberchondria.html' title='Microsoft Examines &quot;Cyberchondria&quot;'/><author><name>Gabe D</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11259593342045567503</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8542654753614847833.post-2944617232438061788</id><published>2008-11-24T09:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-24T09:38:38.389-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Cyberchondriacs and Health Info-entials are Early Adopters of Healthy Behavior</title><content type='html'>Harris Interactive coined the name Cyberchondriacs to describe individuals who go on-line regularly to search for health information. Edelman, in their recently available Health Engagement Barometer (&lt;a href="http://engageinhealth.com/"&gt;http://engageinhealth.com&lt;/a&gt;) uses Health Info-entials to describe individuals who claim to be highly involved with health issues and actively seek and share health information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According a Harris poll of 1,010 US (&lt;a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/newsletters_healthcare.asp"&gt;http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/newsletters_healthcare.asp&lt;/a&gt;) adults conducted in July, 2008, 150 million Americans claim to go online to obtain health information. While this is a big number (66% of all adults and 81% of those who are online) it represents a decrease from the 160 million reported just a year ago. When Harris began measuring the number of people going online for health information in 1998, they reported 54 million. Here are a few highlights that describe Cyberchondriac behavior in 2008:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25% go online often for health info.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They average 4.8 online searches per month for health info.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;86% believe the info they get online is reliable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;47% discuss the info they obtain online with their doctors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;49% go online to seek info as a result of discussions with their doctors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edelman study is based a much larger and more diverse population totaling 5,183 adults distributed approximately evenly among the US, UK, Germany, Russia and China. They found that one in five of those surveyed were Health Info-entials. It is interesting to note that they ranged from 35% in China to 13% in UK.

It seems that any proposal to reform healthcare in America is counting on it. As an example, here is an excerpt from “C&lt;a href="http://www.finance.senate.org/"&gt;all to Action, Health Reform 2009”&lt;/a&gt; written by Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus (D. MONT.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Baucus plan would immediately refocus our health care system toward prevention and wellness, rather than on illness and treatment. Those who are uninsured ― and therefore less likely to receive preventive care and treatment for major conditions ― would be given a “RightChoices” card that guarantees access to recommended preventive care, including services like a health risk assessment, physical exam, immunizations, and age and gender appropriate cancer screenings recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We agree with Sen. Baucus that focusing on prevention and wellness is an essential part of meaningful reform. But there is no silver bullet unless there is a significant shift in people’s attitudes about their own health. What if individuals could be given a custom health plan based on their genes and family history? As Blankenhorn asks in his blog, “Will we follow it? And what will following it cost, as opposed to waiting for your stroke, having a good time, and then dieing suddenly in middle age?”</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/feeds/4405776634912930934/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8542654753614847833&amp;postID=4405776634912930934' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/4405776634912930934'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/4405776634912930934'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/2008/11/can-preventive-care-change-unhealthy.html' title='Can Preventive Care Change Unhealthy Behavior?'/><author><name>Meghan O'Sullivan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15111971963114291996</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8542654753614847833.post-7775205924102752257</id><published>2008-11-17T14:06:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-17T14:06:56.720-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Unhealthy behavior is a way of life in Huntington W.

Huntington also leads in 6 other illness measures including heart disease and diabetes. It even tops the percentage of adults who have lost all their teeth (half of them have). This is in sharp contrast to another out of the way college town—Burlington VT—ranked by the CDC as the healthiest city in America in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huntington and Burlington share similar attributes of both being college towns and both having overwhelming white populations of English, Irish or German ancestry. But there the similarities end.  Burlington is younger, better off financially (8% living at federal poverty level vs. 19% in Huntington) and better educated (40% have at least a college degree vs. 15% in Huntington). These differences, coupled with regional cultural differences help to explain why Huntington’s adult population is not only unhealthy but has little motivation to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Huntington, high unemployment and the high poverty level combine to make even basic health care services unaffordable. In Burlington, IBM, the area’s largest employer, influences good health through its insurance plans and well funded wellness initiatives. In Huntington, many people think of exercise and healthy eating as luxuries. In Burlington they are considered the norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the poor health rating for the Huntington area is a terrible distinction, the locals rarely talk about it. In fact, follow up surveys showed that most people weren’t aware of it. And when made aware, most saw little reason to change their behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huntington is a perfect candidate for applying behavioral economics to change the health status of a population. By identifying biases that lead to bad health decisions, health providers and community agencies can exploit these biases by making the healthiest choices the ones that follow the path of least resistance. For example, fast food is a major food supply for residents who believe they can’t afford to buy healthier food. Fast food restaurants could apply behavioral economics by substituting bottled water for soda as the default beverage with a combo meal. The soda would be available only on request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gabe d'Annunzio</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/feeds/7775205924102752257/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8542654753614847833&amp;postID=7775205924102752257' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/7775205924102752257'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/7775205924102752257'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/2008/11/unhealthy-behavior-is-way-of-life-in.html' title='Unhealthy behavior is a way of life in Huntington W.

And our country is heading for tragedy with regards to health care. It's not just that people don't listen to their doctors - they also aren't going - especially if they perceive it's more important to fill their cars with gas and put food on the table vs. paying for prescriptions or doctors visits. In a recent article in the WSJ (Consumers Cut Health Spending as Economic Downturn Takes Toll 9.22/Vanessa Furhmans)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the credit crunch threatens to throw the economy into a deep slump, Americans are already cutting back on health care... Health policy experts say patients short term care cutbacks could lead to more medical problems and higher spending down the road.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#33cc00;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Here are some more alarming statistics from this article.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#33cc00;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;According to National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 11% of consumers surveyed said they scaled back on prescription drugs to save money. And 22% said the economy is causing them to go to the doctor less &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is unless people change their behavior and play an active role taking care of their own health, there will always be a health care crisis (sicker people = increased health costs for everyone). Yet, as organizational behavior specialists would say you can't change behavior without metrics. In other words, Brian Regan and others might decide to do something about their high cholesterol if they had incentives to do so. People might make the choice to fill their prescriptions if they were less costly. And they would certainly take their meds if they knew  not taking them would cause them to pay a higher premiums on their health care.  The bottom line is - incentives change people's behavior - and as Ruth Buzzy would say - "That's the Truth." &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='enclosure' type='video/mp4' href='http://www.blogger.com/video-play.mp4?contentId=cdcde31672e832fa&amp;type=video%2Fmp4' length='0'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/feeds/4111466058286517055/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8542654753614847833&amp;postID=4111466058286517055' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/4111466058286517055'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8542654753614847833/posts/default/4111466058286517055'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unhealthybehavior.blogspot.com/2008/11/truth-in-comedy.html' title='Truth in Comedy'/><author><name>Meghan O'Sullivan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15111971963114291996</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
