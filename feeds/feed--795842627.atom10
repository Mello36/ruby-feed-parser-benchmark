They find that they can make things happen that the previous generation couldn't cause they were so mired in the complexity of the systems they had built. The new systems become popular with "power users" -- people who yearn to overcome the limits of the previous generation. It's exhilirating! [...]&lt;br /&gt;The trick in each cycle is to fight complexity, so the growth can keep going. But you can't keep it out, engineers like complexity, not just because it provides them job security, also because they really just like it. But once the stack gets too arcane, the next generation throws their hands up and says "We're not going to deal with that mess."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I may be a few years behind Dave, but I think he is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, or the stack out with the cycle here. Back when I started out, to get &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET"&gt;my computer&lt;/a&gt; to generate sound, I had to make my own &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-Analog_Converter"&gt;D to A converter&lt;/a&gt; to attach to the parallel port, and for non-character graphics, my hardware hacker friends swapped the character generator ROM for RAM, and I had to code in assembler to swap the display data in time.&lt;p&gt;Now my son thinks nothing of &lt;a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-composition-sky-high-view-of-utopia.html"&gt;mixing 10 polyphonic Midi tracks in an afternoon&lt;/a&gt; or editing hi-def video (and yes, it's on an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.4"&gt;OS&lt;/a&gt; I helped to make capable of that).&lt;p&gt;Dave's revolutionary impulsiveness has a germ of truth, but what really happens is that successful technologies become invisible infrastructure for the next things that build on them. &lt;p&gt; I no longer need to write assembler, heck I no longer need to write C code. Dave's very URL - scripting.com - shows how we have built up layers of utility to work upon.&lt;p&gt;HTTP, HTML,  JSON, Atom and Javascript are &lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/12/07/rethinking-out-loud-about-infrastructure/"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; now. Our deepest role as developers is to build the invisible infrastructure for the next generation to take for granted, so they imagine new abstractions atop that. Dave did it with feeds.&lt;p&gt;What we're doing with the Open Stack — &lt;a href="http://openid.net/"&gt;OpenID&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://oauth.net/"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://portablecontacts.net/"&gt;PortableContacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.opensocial.org/"&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt;— is  part of this evolutionary cycle too. We're combining building blocks into a simplified whole that makes sense to people who want their websites to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/"&gt;become social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;It comes down to what you can take for granted as the baseline to build the next exciting cycle on.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/7378275535700019670/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=7378275535700019670' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/7378275535700019670?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7378275535700019670'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/12/cycling-to-new-layers-of-freedom.html' title='Cycling to new layers of freedom'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-7988412345699405767</id><published>2008-11-13T15:57:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-14T12:57:17.167-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-14T12:57:17.167-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OAuth'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Portable Contacts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenSocial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenID'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Open Stack'/><title type='text'>OpenSocial’s birthday today</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/3028359476/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/3028359476_489ba834f0_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/3028359476/"&gt;OpenSocial Reach chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/kevinmarks/"&gt;Kevin Marks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just over a year ago, we launched &lt;a href="http://opensocial.org"&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt; to the web, with a few example applications and a lot of potential. Now&lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/28160/"&gt;, a year on&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/open-social-turns-one-my-how-youve-grown/"&gt;over 600 million social network users&lt;/a&gt; can use OpenSocial applications in their preferred social network sites.&lt;br /&gt;Then, applications had to be embedded in sites as gadgets, which makes the social context clear for users, but  means developers have to write some Javascript, and can only run code when the user is looking at the site.&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2008/11/12/opensocial-and-0-8.aspx"&gt;OpenSocial 0.8 rolling out&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.opensocial.org/Home/sharing-and-accessing-social-data"&gt;REST APIs&lt;/a&gt; mean that developers can integrate with social sites using server-side code directly, potentially delegating user registration, profiles and friend relationships to an already-trusted social site, and feeding activity updates back into them.&lt;br /&gt;To do this, we are building an &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56624456@N00/3020508770/"&gt;Open Stack&lt;/a&gt;, based on &lt;a href="http://openid.org"&gt;OpenID&lt;/a&gt;, XRDS-Simple, &lt;a href="http://oauth.net/"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://portablecontacts.net"&gt;PortableContacts&lt;/a&gt; and OpenSocial. By composing open standards in this way, we can make each one more valuable. The &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/11/missing-point-of-openid.html"&gt;advantages of OpenID over email login in itself&lt;/a&gt; are not that obvious to users, but if the OpenID can be used to bring in your profile and contacts data - with your permission via OAuth - suddenly the added value is clear to users and developers alike. This connection was one of the exciting discussions at the &lt;a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/Iiw2008b"&gt;Internet Identity Workshop&lt;/a&gt; this week - here's a &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/11/13/the-open-stack-discussed-at-internet-identity-workshop/"&gt;video of myself, Steve Gillmor, David Recordon and Cliff Gerrish talking about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/7988412345699405767/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=7988412345699405767' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/7988412345699405767?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7988412345699405767'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/11/opensocial-birthday-today.html' title='OpenSocial’s birthday today'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-1082599879787215711</id><published>2008-11-08T23:18:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-09T01:19:38.144-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-09T01:19:38.144-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Portable Contacts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='IIW'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenSocial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenID'/><title type='text'>Missing the point of OpenID</title><content type='html'>I'm puzzled by &lt;a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/11/07/WhyGoogleForkedOpenIDAndOtherStories.aspx"&gt;Dare's post on OpenID&lt;/a&gt;, as he is wilfully misunderstanding its advantages at each stage, and I know he's smarter than that. He gets it right that OpenID is a way to confirm that a user owns a URL, without the rigmarole required to do so for an email address. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the then uses his unmemorable Facebook URL http://www.facebook.com/p/Dare_Obasanjo/500050028 as an example, rather than any of the memorable ones he actually uses and people refer to, such as http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ or http://carnage4life.spaces.live.com/ or http://twitter.com/Carnage4Life &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeWitt Clinton did an excellent job of clearing up some of &lt;a href="http://blog.unto.net/miscellaneous/clearing-up-inaccuracies-about-the-google-openid-idp-launch/"&gt;Dare's other innaccuracies&lt;/a&gt;, but he then rhetorically exaggerated thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;URLs make fantastic identifiers — for the 0.1% of the web population that understands that they “are” a URL. Fortunately, the other 99.9% of the world (our parents, for example) already understand that they have an email address.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is missing the huge population of the online world (our children, for example) who consider email a messy noisy way to talk to old people, or to sign up to services when forced to, but are happy using their MySpace or Bebo or Hi5 or LiveJournal or  Blogger or Twitter URLs to refer to themselves.&lt;br /&gt;As I said in &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/urls-are-people-too.html"&gt;URLs are People Too&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;The underlying thing that is wrong with an email address is that it's affordance is backwards - it enables people who have it to send things to you, but there's no reliable way to know that a message is from you. Conversely, URLs have the opposite default affordance- people can go look at them and see what you have said about yourself, and computers can go and visit them and discover other ways to interact with what you have published, or ask you permission for more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I see OpenID providing a key advantage is in it's coupling with URL-based endpoints that provide more information and save the user time. The OpenID to &lt;a href="http://portablecontacts.net/"&gt;PortableContacts&lt;/a&gt; connection &lt;a href="http://portablecontactsdemo.janrain.com/"&gt;as demonstrated by janrain&lt;/a&gt; can add your friends (with permission) from an OpenID login directly via OAuth.&lt;br /&gt;This makes the OpenID login instantly more useful than an email one, and by connecting to an OpenSocial endpoint too, you can couple activities you take on the wider web with the site you trust to be a custodian of your profile and friends data, so your friends can discover what you are doing elsewhere, and come and join you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to talking through these issues at &lt;a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/Iiw2008b"&gt;Internet Identity World&lt;/a&gt; next week in Mountain View.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/1082599879787215711/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=1082599879787215711' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/1082599879787215711?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1082599879787215711'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/11/missing-point-of-openid.html' title='Missing the point of OpenID'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-2541521526934607311</id><published>2008-11-07T22:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-08T00:02:07.535-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-08T00:02:07.535-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='blogging'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='blogosphere'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networks'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='publics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gestures'/><title type='text'>Blogging's not dead, it's becoming like air</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned at Technorati is that one sure-fire way to get linked to by bloggers is to write an article about blogging. Sure enough, &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12566826"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/11/who_killed_the.php"&gt;Nick Carr&lt;/a&gt; have, with their 'death of the blogosphere' articles, garnered a fair bit of linkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their curious obsession with the Technorati Top 100 is missing what is really happening. As &lt;a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/11/08/i-said-the-fly/"&gt;JP&lt;/a&gt; points out, the old blogging crew are still around, they're just blogging less that those paid to do so a dozen times a day. Not because they are less interested or engaged, but because there are now many new ways to do what we used blogs for back then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, if we wanted to share brief thoughts, we &lt;a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2001/11/07"&gt;used a blog&lt;/a&gt;; to link to others’ posts, we &lt;a href="http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/oldarchives/2001_11_04_instapundit_archive.html"&gt;used a blog&lt;/a&gt;. If we wanted a group discussion, we made a &lt;a href="http://gonzoengaged.blogspot.com/2002_01_27_archive.html#9139273"&gt;group blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Technorati, and trackback and pingback, we built tools to follow cross-blog conversations, and learned that we are each others’ media. As I &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004/07/call-off-search.html"&gt;wrote in 2004&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about weblogs is when you discover someone. Someone who makes sense to you, or someone who surprises you with a viewpoint you hadn't thought of. Once you have found them you can subscribe to their feeds and see how they can keep inspiring or surprising you.&lt;br /&gt;You can even start a blog, link to them, and join the conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/05/my-tail-is-longer-than-yours.html"&gt;I reiterated&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking people linking to me or mentioning my name, Technorati helps me in this distributed asynchronous conversation (thats how I found Mike and Dave's comments, after all). However, as I've said before, "I can read your thoughts, as long as you write them down first". In order to be in the conversation, you need to be writing and linking. Perforce, this means that those who write and link more, and are written about and linked to more, are those who most see the utility of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has happened since is that the practices of blogging have become reified into mainstream usage. Through social networks and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kevinmarks"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/03474483732051894197/state/com.google/broadcast"&gt;Reader shared items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://huffduffer.com/kevinmarks"&gt;HuffDuffer&lt;/a&gt; and all the other nicely-focused gesture spreading tools we have, the practice of blogging, of mediating the world for each other, has become part of the fabric of the net.&lt;br /&gt;This may be the first blogpost I've written since August, but the many &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html"&gt;digital publics&lt;/a&gt; I'm part of have been flowing media and friendly gestures to and from me all the time. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/2541521526934607311/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=2541521526934607311' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/2541521526934607311?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2541521526934607311'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/11/bloggings-not-dead-its-becoming-like.html' title='Blogging&apos;s not dead, it&apos;s becoming like air'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-902142674398128375</id><published>2008-08-04T00:11:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-08-04T00:37:07.565-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-08-04T00:37:07.565-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social software'/><title type='text'>Social Disease, or making magic?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2008/08/02/is_the_problem_social.php"&gt;Suw is musing thoughtfully on the overtones of describing something as ‘social’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monica thanked me for the explanation, saying that she was glad I had elaborated as she had thought, and I hope she forgives me for paraphrasing, that 'social software was something awful, like social workers'. That really made me think, and I haven't quite got to the end of where that throwaway comment has led me.&lt;p&gt;Is 'social' the problem with social software? Certainly in the UK, 'social' has some rather negative connotations: Social workers are often despised and derided as interfering, and often incompetent, busybodies. Social housing is where you put people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Social sciences are the humanities trying to sound important by putting on sciency airs. Social climbers are people who know how to suck their way up the ladder. Social engineering is getting your way deviously, by using people's weaknesses against them. Social security is money you give people who can't be bother work for themselves. Socialism is an inherently flawed system that is prone to corruption. Social disease is venereal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me of &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/04/social-software-again.html"&gt;early in the Social Sofware story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;The SSA meeting was fairly chaotic - perhaps reflecting the diverse meanings of 'Social'. Clay Shirky did not show up (or if he did, did not speak up); Dave Winer later poured scorn on the efforts, implying it was all about social climbing. &lt;p&gt;Friedrich Hayek famously said that the word 'social' empties the noun it is applied to of their meaning. Hayek goes on: &lt;blockquote&gt;...it has in fact become the most harmful instance of what, after Shakespeare's 'I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs' ( As You Like It , II, 5), some Americans call a 'weasel word'. As a weasel is alleged to be able to empty an egg without leaving a visible sign, so can these words deprive of content any term to which they are prefixed while seemingly leaving them untouched. A weasel word is used to draw the teeth from a concept one is obliged to employ, but from which one wishes to eliminate all implications that challenge one's ideological premises.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the problem is that the social realm is the realm of trust, so saying things are social is asserting "trust me". As &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/17/080317fa_fact_gopnik?currentPage=all"&gt;Adam Gopnik writes on magic in the New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Too Perfect theory has larger meanings, too. It reminds us that, whatever the context, the empathetic interchange between minds is satisfying only when it is “dynamic,” unfinished, unresolved. Friendships, flirtations, even love affairs depend, like magic tricks, on a constant exchange of incomplete but tantalizing information. We are always reducing the claim or raising the proof. The magician teaches us that romance lies in an unstable contest of minds that leaves us knowing it’s a trick but not which one it is, and being impressed by the other person’s ability to let the trickery go on.[...]&lt;p&gt;I saw, too, that David Blaine is absolutely sincere in his belief that the way forward for a young magician lies not in mastering the tricks but in mastering the mind of the modern age, with its relentless appetite for speed and for the sensational-dressed-as-the-real. And I thought I sensed in Swiss the urge to say what all of us would like to say—that traditions are not just encumbrances, that a novel is not news, that an essay is a different thing from an Internet rant, that techniques are the probity and ethic of magic, the real work. The crafts that we have mastered are, in part, the tricks that we have learned, and though we know how much knowledge the tricks enfold, still, tricks is what they are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/902142674398128375/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=902142674398128375' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/902142674398128375?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/902142674398128375'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/08/social-disease.html' title='Social Disease, or making magic?'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-6354437860605860021</id><published>2008-07-31T13:12:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-31T13:21:39.017-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-07-31T13:21:39.017-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social Cloud'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenSocial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networks'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='open web'/><title type='text'>Open Source and Social Cloud Computing</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Tim O'Reilly has written an excellent review post on &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/07/open-source-and-cloud-computing.html"&gt;Open Source and Cloud Computing&lt;/a&gt; which says, among other things:&lt;blockquote&gt;The interoperable internet should be the platform, not any one vendor's private preserve.&lt;p&gt;So here's my first piece of advice: if you care about open source for the cloud, build on services that are designed to be federated rather than centralized. Architecture trumps licensing any time.&lt;p&gt;But peer-to-peer architectures aren't as important as open standards and protocols. If services are required to interoperate, competition is preserved. Despite all Microsoft and Netscape's efforts to "own" the web during the browser wars, they failed because Apache held the line on open standards. This is why the Open Web Foundation, announced last week at OScon, is putting an important stake in the ground. It's not just open source software for the web that we need, but open standards that will ensure that dominant players still have to play nice.&lt;p&gt;The "internet operating system" that I'm hoping to see evolve over the next few years will require developers to move away from thinking of their applications as endpoints, and more as re-usable components. For example, why does every application have to try to recreate its own social network? Shouldn't social networking be a system service?&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a "moral" appeal, but strategic advice.[...]&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A key test of whether an API is open is whether it is used to enable services that are not hosted by the API provider&lt;/b&gt;, and are distributed across the web.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this API openness test is not strong enough. As I wrote in &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/api-is-bespoke-suit-standard-is-t-shirt.html"&gt;An API is a bespoke suit, a standard is a t-shirt&lt;/a&gt;, for me the key test is that implementations can interoperate without knowing of each others' existence, let alone having to have a business relationship. That's when you have an open spec.&lt;p&gt;The other thing I resist in the idea of an internet operating system is that that the net is composable, not monolithic. You can swap in and implementations of different pieces, and combine different specs that solve one piece of the problem without having to be connected to everything else.&lt;p&gt;The original point of the cloud was a solved piece of the problem that means you don't have to worry about the internal implementation.&lt;p&gt;Thus, the answer to "shouldn't social networking be a system service?" is yes, it should be a &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/02/social-cloud.html"&gt;Social Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. That's exactly what we are working on in &lt;a href="http://www.opensocial.org/"&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/6354437860605860021/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=6354437860605860021' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/6354437860605860021?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/6354437860605860021'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/07/open-source-and-social-cloud-computing.html' title='Open Source and Social Cloud Computing'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-5945823426374252495</id><published>2008-07-28T18:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-28T18:37:32.641-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-07-28T18:37:32.641-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='animateur'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Teresa Nielsen-Hayden'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='conversational catalyst'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Tom Coates'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Clay Shirky'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='geisha'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Obama'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummler'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Chief Conversation Officer'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='moderation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Christy Canida'/><title type='text'>Here Comes Everybody - Tummlers, Geishas, Animateurs and Chief Conversation Officers help us listen</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100511"&gt;Bob Garfield's&lt;/a&gt; de haut en bas attack on web commenters upset two very skilled conversational catalysts, &lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/episodes/2008/07/25/segments/104537"&gt;Ira Glass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://powazek.com/posts/1040"&gt;Derek Powazek&lt;/a&gt;. The false dichotomy of 'we choose who you get to hear' and 'total anarchic mob noise' was dismissed by &lt;a href="http://www.jacklail.com/blog/archives/2008/07/improve-this-post-with-comment.html"&gt;Jack Lail&lt;/a&gt; too. At the same time, &lt;a href="http://www.links.org/?p=351"&gt;Ben Laurie explained&lt;/a&gt; how the IETF's open-to-all mailing lists can be hijacked by time-rich fools, talking about the &lt;a href="http://openwebfoundation.org/"&gt;Open Web Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://www.supernova2008.com"&gt;Supernova&lt;/a&gt; last month, listening to &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/"&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt; talk about the &lt;a href="http://conversationhub.com/2008/06/16/interview-with-clay-shirky/"&gt;problems of collective action&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of a small nit I have with his excellent book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0385520808%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1594201536%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"&gt;Here Comes Everybody&lt;/a&gt; (which you should all read). He talks about the deep changes that ridiculously easy group forming online has wrought, but he also explains that most of these groups fail, in various ways.&lt;p&gt;The key to this is finding people who play the role of conversational catalyst within a group, to welcome newcomers, rein in old hands and set the tone of the conversation so that it can become a community. Clay referred to &lt;a href="http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/"&gt;Teresa Nielsen-Hayden&lt;/a&gt;, who is a great example of this, and I have had the privilege to discuss this with Teresa, Amy Muller,&lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/canida/"&gt;Christy Canida&lt;/a&gt; and others at the &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/03/troll-whispering-at-web2open.html"&gt;Troll Whispering&lt;/a&gt; session at Web2Open, and heard very similar stories from Gina Trapini, Annalee Newitz, Jessamyn West and Jeska Dzwigalski  at &lt;a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2008/04/09/users_are_revolting"&gt;The Users Are Revolting&lt;/a&gt; at SXSW.&lt;p&gt;The communities that fail, whether dying out from apathy or being overwhelmed by noise, are the ones that don't have someone there cherishing the conversation, setting the tone, creating a space to speak, and rapidly segregating those intent on damage. The big problem with have is that we don't have a English name for this role; they get called 'Moderators' (as &lt;a href="http://www.everythinginmoderation.org/2003/10/index.shtml"&gt;Tom Coates thoroughly described&lt;/a&gt;) or '&lt;a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/essential-skills-of-a-community-manager/"&gt;Community&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://arielwaldman.com/2008/05/23/twitter-responds/"&gt;Managers&lt;/a&gt;', and because when they're doing it right you see everyone's conversation, not their carefully crafted atmosphere, their role is often ignored.&lt;p&gt;In other languages there are words closer to this role - &lt;a href="http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/7/19/108121.html"&gt;Suw and I thought of &lt;i&gt;geisha&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a while back, whereas Teresa suggested the Yiddish &lt;i&gt;Tummler&lt;/i&gt; - both &lt;a href="http://www.deborahschultz.com/"&gt;Deb Schultz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://heathergold.com/"&gt;Heather Gold&lt;/a&gt; liked that one. In French &lt;i&gt;animateur&lt;/i&gt; has the broader connotations of discussion, leadership and guidance needed, but in English we are stuck with enervated latinate words like &lt;i&gt;facilitator&lt;/i&gt;. Even an &lt;a href="http://www.edwoj.com/Alinsky/AlinskyObamaChapter1990.htm"&gt;eloquent and charismatic presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt;had a difficult time explaining what a 'Community Organizer' does, around the same time that &lt;a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm"&gt;Bartlett was resorting to card tricks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Which brings me back to Clay's book - in it he gives an account of the #joiito chatroom that completely misses the rôle that JeannieCool played there, making her sound like a n00b. The software tool, jibot, that has helped keep that conversation going for 5 years, was &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/07/social-botware.html"&gt;built to support Jeannie's role as conversational catalyst&lt;/a&gt;. I do hope he gets a chance to correct this in the next edition.&lt;p&gt;The broader issue is one that we are still working on - building rules for &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/04/emergent-aristocracy.html"&gt;who gets to speak where and when&lt;/a&gt;, re-imagining the historic model of a single hegemonic public record that print Journalism still aspires to, from its roots in the coffeeshops of London into the &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html"&gt;many parallel publics we see on the web&lt;/a&gt;, and how &lt;a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=1109"&gt;legal precedents designed for a monopoly of speech make no sense here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if your &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2008/07/23/required_reading_for_public_media_executives_and_programme_makers.php"&gt;social media initiative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/07/28/comments-on-comments-on-comments/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; isn't working right, you need to find your tummler, geisha, animateur or conversational catalyst, but you should consider giving them a big name title like 'Chief Conversation Officer'.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/5945823426374252495/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=5945823426374252495' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/5945823426374252495?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5945823426374252495'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/07/here-comes-everybody-tummlers-geishas.html' title='Here Comes Everybody - Tummlers, Geishas, Animateurs and Chief Conversation Officers help us listen'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-8928849915369486369</id><published>2008-07-08T23:44:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-09T00:40:25.618-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-07-09T00:40:25.618-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='http'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='URLs'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tinyurl'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='bit.ly'/><title type='text'>Shortening URLs, or getting inbetween?</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;With the rise of short message systems like Twitter, there is a growth in URL shorteners (as each one's namespace gets full, others get shorter). Today &lt;a href="http://bit.ly"&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; launched to &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/bitly_alternative_to_tinyurl.php"&gt;big fanfare&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/07/08/bitlyLaunchesToday.html"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;I took a closer look. What I noticed is that the older generation of these - &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com"&gt;tinyurl.com&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://xrl.us"&gt; xrl.us&lt;/a&gt; use a &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.2"&gt;301 Moved Permanently&lt;/a&gt; redirect, whereas &lt;a href="http://bit.ly"&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://is.gd"&gt;is.gd&lt;/a&gt; use a &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3"&gt;302 Found&lt;/a&gt; redirect, which means 'don't cache the redirected URL, keep checking the original'.&lt;p&gt;In other words, these services are saying in their HTTP responses that they may change what the short URLs point to in future, putting browsers, indexers and caches on notice that this may happen.&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that bit.ly, like tinyurl.com,  allows you to pick a custom label from their namespace, but if you do it returns two 302 redirects in sequence (once to a more cryptic bit.ly url, then to the external one you chose). I pointed &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/k"&gt;bit.ly/k&lt;/a&gt; at this blog, so you can check it yourself with &lt;a href="http://curl.haxx.se/"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ curl --head http://bit.ly/k&lt;br /&gt;HTTP/1.1 302 Found&lt;br /&gt;Location: http://bit.ly/fwNKA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ curl --head http://bit.ly/fwNKA&lt;br /&gt;HTTP/1.1 302 Found&lt;br /&gt;Location: http://epeus.blogspot.com&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the extra delay this introduces, this is also telling your browser and web crawlers  not to cache this, as they may change it in future. Compare tinyurl.com:&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ curl --head http://tinyurl.com/kevinm&lt;br /&gt;HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently&lt;br /&gt;Location: http://epeus.blogspot.com&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's advice for webmasters is to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=93633"&gt;use 301 for redirects&lt;/a&gt;, as this signals the preferred URL.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/8928849915369486369/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=8928849915369486369' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/8928849915369486369?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8928849915369486369'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/07/shortening-urls-or-getting-inbetween.html' title='Shortening URLs, or getting inbetween?'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-8527081307823247345</id><published>2008-06-30T14:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-09T00:58:32.364-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-07-09T00:58:32.364-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Gordon Ramsay'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='google'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Restaurants'/><title type='text'>Google as a restaurant? Watch Gordon Ramsay</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/06/30/googlicious/"&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; says he's writing a metaphorical application of Google principles to running a restaurant. Over the last few weekends, while sorting out stuff at home, I've been watching &lt;a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/154/index.jsp"&gt;Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares&lt;/a&gt; which BBC America seems to be playing continuously at weekends. If you haven't seen it, do watch some - each episode, Ramsay spends a week at a failing restaurant in the UK and tries to help them turn it around. &lt;p&gt;After seeing a few, there are recurrent themes that Ramsay comes up with: simple menus, built on good ingredients that local people understand, served promptly. Which fits well with Google's &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html"&gt;ten things&lt;/a&gt; - simple frontend, low latency results, user-focused. How he tries these out involve analogues for user testing, A/B experiments, and profiling under high load. &lt;p&gt;Of course, Google does run restaurants - so Jeff can read how &lt;a href="http://insanecats.com/cgi-bin/single.py?month=jun08&amp;msg=27"&gt;they get built and tested&lt;/a&gt; directly.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/8527081307823247345/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=8527081307823247345' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/8527081307823247345?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8527081307823247345'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-as-restaurant-watch-gordon.html' title='Google as a restaurant?

However, reading the schedule I notice the word 'viral' is still much in evidence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;If you behave like a disease, people develop an immune system&lt;/h4&gt; At the Facebook developer Garage last week, I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/statuses/823070919"&gt;heard a developer say&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;q&gt;when I hear 'viral' applied to software I replace it with 'cancerous' to clarify&lt;/q&gt;. A few months back I wrote that social Apps should be &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/02/be-organic-not-viral.html"&gt;Organic, not Viral&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href="http://"&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt; last week I expanded on this with m'colleagues &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/a4/833"&gt;Vivian Li&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://chrisschalk.com/blog/"&gt;Chris Schalk&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's an overview of the alternative reproductive strategies to being a virus that we came up with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;r-Strategy - scatter lots of seeds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aussiegall/542234036/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1082/542234036_043ef08a19_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aussiegall/542234036/"&gt;Break free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/aussiegall/"&gt;aussiegall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some plants and animals, like dandelions and frogs, rely on having huge numbers of offspring, with the hope that a few of them will survive - this is known as an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_strategy#r-selection"&gt;r strategy&lt;/a&gt;. In application terms this is like wildly sending out invitations, or forcing users to invite their friends before showing them useful information. It may help you spread your seed, but most of them will die off rapidly.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;K-Strategy - nurture your young&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/debschultz/558635601/" title="proud Mama by debs, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/558635601_8da8cbe82e.jpg" alt="proud Mama" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/debschultz/558635601/"&gt;Proud mama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/debschultz/"&gt; debschultz &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mammals take the opposite strategy; they have a few young, and nurture them carefully, expecting most of them to grow up to adulthood and reproduce themselves. This is known as  a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_strategy#K-selection"&gt;K strategy&lt;/a&gt;. This translates into software by following Kathy Sierra's principles to &lt;a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/"&gt;create passionate users&lt;/a&gt; who will share your application through word of mouth. Another way to nurture your users is to encourage them to use your application before they have to install it, as &lt;a href="http://opensocialapis.blogspot.com/2008/03/different-kind-of-opensocial-container.html"&gt;Jonathan Terleski describes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Fruiting - delicious with a seed in&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/madalena_pestana/1360161127/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1009/1360161127_de86417048_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/madalena_pestana/1360161127/"&gt;help yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/madalena_pestana/"&gt;*madalena-pestana*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many plants encourage their seeds to be spread more widely by wrapping them in fruit, so that animals or birds will carry them further, eating the fruit and helping the seed to propagate. The analogy here is in making sure your invitations aren't just bald come-ons for your application "a friend said something - click here to find out what" - with a forced install on the way, but instead are clearly bearing gifts to the receiving user, so they will want to click on the link after seeing what is in store. This is one of Jyri Engström's &lt;a href="http://www.consumingexperience.com/2007/06/5-principles-for-web-20-success-jyri.html"&gt;principles for Web 2.0 success with Social Objects.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rhizomatic - grow from the roots up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wtlphotos/1417674904/" title="Sweetness / Dolcezza by WTL photos, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1208/1417674904_c3e8424c46.jpg" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wtlphotos/1417674904/"&gt;Sweetness / Dolcezza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/wtlphotos/"&gt; WTL photos &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reproductive strategy that many plants, including strawberries and ginger use is to send out runners or shoots from the roots, so that they spread out sideways, from the bottom up, known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome"&gt;rhizomes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolon"&gt;stolons&lt;/a&gt;.  The analogy here is for social applications that spread through appearing in users activity streams and via entries in application directories, growing outwards through the 'grass roots' runners that they send out as part of their normal usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Being dumb gets low CPMs&lt;/h4&gt;A lot of the debate around viral applications reminds me of a &lt;cite&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/cite&gt; quotation:&lt;blockquote&gt;TV is not vulgar and prurient and dumb because the people who compose the audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social networks aren't like TV - everyone sees something different in them.

Obviously, this fits their view of the world, or they wouldn't have built it that way, so they want to share this with everyone. In one way this is like the form-fitting lycra that weekend cyclists are so enamoured of, but working with such APIs is like being a &lt;a href="http://www.englishcut.com/"&gt;bespoke tailor&lt;/a&gt; - you have to measure them carefully, and cut your code exactly right to fit in with their shapes, and the effort is the same for every site you have to deal with (you get more skilled at it over time, but it is a craft nonetheless).&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when a site adopts a standard format for expressing their data, or how to interact with it, you can put your code together once, try it out on some conformance tests, and be sure it will work across a wide range of different sites - it's like designing a t-shirt for &lt;a href="http://threadless.com/"&gt;threadless&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;p&gt;Putting together such standards, like HTML5, OpenID, OAuth or OpenSocial or, for Dave's example of reviews, &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview"&gt;hReview&lt;/a&gt;, takes &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/process"&gt;more thought and reflection&lt;/a&gt; than just replicating your own internal data structures, but the payoff is that implementations can interoperate without knowing of each others' existence, let alone having to have a business relationship.&lt;p&gt;I had this experience at work recently, when the developers of the Korean Social network &lt;a href="http://idtail.com"&gt;idtail&lt;/a&gt; visited. I was expecting to talk to them about implementing OpenSocial on their site, but they said they had already implemented an OpenSocial container and apps using OpenID login, and built their own &lt;a href="http://dev.idtail.com/docs/OpenSocial"&gt;developer site for Korean OpenSocial developers&lt;/a&gt; from reading the &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/a/opensocial.org/opensocial/Technical-Resources"&gt;specification docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to more 'aha' moments like that this week at&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/"&gt; I/O.&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/2879947518310812061/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=2879947518310812061' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/2879947518310812061?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2879947518310812061'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/api-is-bespoke-suit-standard-is-t-shirt.html' title='An API is a bespoke suit, a standard is a t-shirt'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-861245113919594894</id><published>2008-05-07T12:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-07T12:27:12.830-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-05-07T12:27:12.830-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenSocial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='public speaking'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='google io'/><title type='text'>Talking about OpenSocial all over the place</title><content type='html'>I've been travelling a lot to conferences in recent months, and been interviewed by a lot of different journalists too.

In fact, what he describes is a great fit for &lt;a href="http://opensocial.org/"&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;He says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Your data host’s job is to perform actions on your data. Rather than giving copies of your data out to a thousand companies (the Facebook and Data Portability approach) you host the data and perform actions on it, programmed by those companies who are developing useful social applications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly what an &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/container.html"&gt;OpenSocial container&lt;/a&gt; does - mediate access to personal and friend data for 3rd party applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This environment has complete access to the data, and can do anything with it that you want to authorize. The developers provide little applets which run on your data host and provide the functionality. Inside the virtual machine is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security"&gt;Capability-based security &lt;/a&gt;environment which precisely controls what the applets can see and do with it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This maps exactly on to &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/"&gt;Caja&lt;/a&gt;, the capability-based Javascript security model that is being used in OpenSocial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Your database would store your own personal data, and the data your connections have decided to reveal to you. In addition, you would subscribe to a feed of changes from all friends on their data. This allows applications that just run on your immediate social network to run entirely in the data hosting server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, a good match for&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/0.7/reference/opensocial.Activity.html"&gt; OpenSocial's Activity Streams &lt;/a&gt;(and don't forget &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/0.7/spec.html#persistence"&gt;persistent app data on the server&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Currently, &lt;b&gt;everybody&lt;/b&gt; is copying your data, just as a matter of course. That’s the default. They would have to work very hard not to keep a copy. In the data hosting model, they would have to work extra hard, and maliciously, and in violation of contract, to make a copy of your data. Changing it from implicit to overt act can make all the difference.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is worse than that; asking people for their logins to other sites is widespread and dangerous. I'd hope Brad would support &lt;a href="http://oauth.net"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; as a step along the way to his more secure model - especially combined with the &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dc43mmng_2g6k9qzfb"&gt;REST APIs&lt;/a&gt; that are part of &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-and-gadgets-spec/browse_thread/thread/94b6caabc80fc4d0#"&gt;OpenSocial 0.8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in these aspects of OpenSocial, do join in the linked mailing lists, and come along to the &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpensocialApiBlog/~3/284304629/opensocial-summit-may-14th-at.html"&gt;OpenSocial Summit on May 14th&lt;/a&gt; (just down the road from &lt;a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php/Iiw2008a"&gt;IIW&lt;/a&gt;).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/3657940714441036778/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=3657940714441036778' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/3657940714441036778?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3657940714441036778'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/portable-apps-not-data.html' title='Portable Apps, not data?'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-3514338462462895259</id><published>2008-05-05T15:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-05T16:38:17.652-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-05-05T16:38:17.652-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='http'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OAuth'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='VRM'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='feeds'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='public'/><title type='text'>Mixing degrees of publicness in HTTP</title><content type='html'>At the &lt;a href="http://"&gt;Data Sharing Workshop &lt;/a&gt;the other day, we had a discussion about how to combine OAuth and Feeds, which I was reminded of by &lt;a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/05/Changing-Your-Address"&gt;Tim Bray's discussion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=df9dfsgj_1ghhqgjfq"&gt; Adriana and Alec's VRM proposal&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;br /&gt;The session was&lt;a href="http://datasharingsummit.com/dsswiki/index.php?title=OAuth_%2B_Feeds"&gt; tersely summarized here&lt;/a&gt;, but let me recap the problem.&lt;p&gt;When you are browsing the web, you often encounter pages that show different things depending on who you are, such as blog,  wikis, webmail or even banking sites. They do this by getting you to log in, and then using a client-side cookie to save you the bother of doing that every time. When you want to give a site access to another one's data (for example when letting &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/import/people/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; check your &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/"&gt;Google Contacts &lt;/a&gt; for friends), you need to give it a URL to look things up at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy case is public data - then the site can just fetch it, or use a service that caches public data from several places, like the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/"&gt;Social Graph API&lt;/a&gt;. This is like a normal webpage, which is the same for everyone, returning a &lt;a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.1"&gt;HTTP 200 response&lt;/a&gt; with the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other common case is where the data is private. &lt;a href="http://oauth.net/"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; is a great way for you to delegate access to a web service for someone else, which is done by returning an &lt;a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.2"&gt;HTTP 401 response&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;WWW-Authenticate: OAuth&lt;/code&gt; header showing that authentication is needed. If the fetching site sends a valid &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; header, it can have access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky case is where there is useful data that can be returned to anyone with a 200, but additional information could be supplied to a caller with authentication (think of this like the social network case, where friends get to see your home phone number and address, but strangers just get your hometown). In this case, returning a 401 would be incorrect,as there is useful data there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What struck me was that in this case, the server could return a 200, but include a &lt;code&gt;WWW-Authenticate: OAuth&lt;/code&gt; header to indicate that more information is available if you authenticate correctly. This seems the minimal change that could support this duality, and much easier than requiring and signalling separate authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints through a HTML-level discovery model, or, worse, adding a new response to HTTP. What I'd like to know from people with deeper HTTP experience than me is whether this is viable, and is it likely to be benign for existing clients — will they choke on a 200 with a  &lt;code&gt;WWW-Authenticate&lt;/code&gt; header?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTTP does have a &lt;a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.4"&gt;203 response&lt;/a&gt; meaning Non-Authoritative Data, but I suspect returning that is more likely to have side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/3514338462462895259/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=3514338462462895259' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/3514338462462895259?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3514338462462895259'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/mixing-degrees-of-publicness-in-http.html' title='Mixing degrees of publicness in HTTP'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-942037041992397323</id><published>2008-04-29T02:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-29T03:17:27.198-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-04-29T03:17:27.198-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mimi Ito'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='danah boyd'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social Cloud'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Twitter'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='public'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Christy Canida'/><title type='text'>Digital publics, Conversations and Twitter</title><content type='html'>Last week, I left the Web 2.0 conference to listen to &lt;a href="http://www.itofisher.com/mito/weblog/"&gt;Mimi Ito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/MacArthur2008.html"&gt;danah boyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/"&gt;their colleagues&lt;/a&gt; talk about their research on Digital Publics.&lt;p&gt; Now if you haven't been paying attention, that plural of 'public' there may throw you. Surely things are either 'public' or 'private'? As danah explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as context is destabilized through networked publics, so is the meaning of public and private. What I learned from talked to teens is that they are living in a world where things are "public by default, private when necessary." Teens see public acts amongst peers as being key to status. Writing a public message to someone on their wall is a way of validating them amongst their peers. Likewise, teens make choices to go private to avoid humiliating one of their friends.&lt;p&gt;Yet, their idea of public is not about all people across all space and all time. They want publics of peers, not publics where creeps and parents lurk.&lt;p&gt;Bly Lauritano-Werner (17, Maine): &lt;blockquote&gt;My mom always uses the excuse about the internet being 'public' when she defends herself. It's not like I do anything to be ashamed of, but a girl needs her privacy. I do online journals so I can communicate with my friends. Not so my mother could catch up on the latest gossip of my life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Properties of technology have complicated what it means to be in public. We are all used to being in publics that don't include all people across all space and all time. Many of us grew up gossiping with friends out in public and stopping the moment that an adult walks over. This isn't possible when things are persistent. And it's really hard to be public to all peers and just keep certain people out. So teens are learning how to negotiate a world where the very meaning of public and private have changed. Again, this is a good thing. They're going to need these skills in the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before, at Web2Open, I had heard something similar in the &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/03/troll-whispering-at-web2open.html"&gt;Troll Whispering&lt;/a&gt; session. &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/canida"&gt;Christy Canida&lt;/a&gt; explained that when someone posts something trollish or otherwise dubious on &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com"&gt;her site&lt;/a&gt;, they get put in a state where only they can see their posts, but no-one else can (except Christy and the other conversation monitors). This damps down the flame responses until Christy and co have time to review, and maybe release them, but in their view the post is on the site, but no-one is responding.&lt;p&gt;This varying view of the web, depending on who you are, seems odd at first, but it is in fact a recognition in code of what actually exists in human attention. We don't all read the same web, we see &lt;a href="http://nonzero.blogspot.com/2002_05_01_nonzero_archive.html#85083124"&gt;our own reflections&lt;/a&gt; in what we seek through searches or filtered by our homophily-led reading.&lt;p&gt;Which is where Twitter comes in. &lt;a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/2008/04/twitter-where-n.html"&gt;Like Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, I've been twittering more than blogging recently, and while immediacy is part of it, a far stronger thing is that I have a sense of public there - a public of people I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kevinmarks"&gt;choose to follow&lt;/a&gt; and who chose to follow me. Everyone who uses Twitter sees a different, semi-overlapping public, which maps closer to our individual idea of the digital public we are speaking to, and listening to; one that maps more closely what the socialogist and  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1890951293%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1890951293%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"&gt;theorists&lt;/a&gt; have been describing for a while.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/942037041992397323/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=942037041992397323' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/942037041992397323?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/942037041992397323'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html' title='Digital publics, Conversations and Twitter'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-4936226143146995421</id><published>2008-04-16T23:02:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-17T00:21:22.521-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-04-17T00:21:22.521-07:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Comcast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='internet'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='net neutrality'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='bndwidth'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FCC'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Bittorrent'/><title type='text'>Comcast's Bialystock and Bloom Business Model?</title><content type='html'>Tomorrow, the &lt;a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-280895A1.pdf"&gt;FCC is holding&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/=stanford"&gt;public hearing at Stanford&lt;/a&gt; on Broadband network management practices. With striking timing, Comcast today managed to announce a 'Internet Bill of Rights' &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/comcast-wants-to-be-the-n_b_96902.html"&gt;without inviting any users&lt;/a&gt;, and simultaneously &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/16/aNewReasonToHateComcast.html"&gt;cut off Dave Winer's net connection&lt;/a&gt; for exceeding their secret usage limits. I can't &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares/statuses/790737408"&gt;link to Comcast's policy &lt;/a&gt;because their website  mungs the text in via javascript - here's what they say:&lt;blockquote&gt;Excessive use means data usage that is not characteristic of a typical residential user of the service as determined by Comcast.[...]Comcast currently identifies well less than 1% of Comcast High-Speed Internet customers as excessive users each month. [...]Many excessive users consume more data than a business-class T1 line running at full capacity in a month. [T1 is 1.5 Mbit/sec - Comcast claims to offer 12 Mbit/sec for PowerBoost, and 6/8 Mbit/sec standard] [...] Currently, each month Comcast identifies the top bandwidth users of its High-Speed Internet service by determining aggregate data usage across its entire customer base nationwide. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they are saying is that they use a crude averaging model, and penalize you if you don't fit, for example by using the connection capacity they promise more than 10% of the time. Now, this could be called Procrustean, but it reminds me of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Producers-Special-Zero-Mostel/dp/B00005JK45/"&gt;The Producers&lt;/a&gt;, where Bialystock and Bloom sold a hundred people 10% shares of the show, assuming it would fail. Sadly for Comcast, people like Dave are finding new uses for the net's bandwidth, and not just checking email sporadically any more.&lt;p&gt;Conventional internet service user models are based on users downloading more then they upload, from common big media sites that can be easily cached. However, as &lt;a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/"&gt;Odlyzko pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, citing &lt;a href="http://www.lesk.com/mlesk/ksg97/ksg.html"&gt;Lesk's now decade-old work&lt;/a&gt;, the dominant form of data creation is photographs. Now all these photographs are actually digital, and we want to share them so others can see them. Because we aren't allowed to run our own servers by the likes of Comcast, we have to upload them to Flickr or Photobucket or Picasa to share them. This gives us an 'upload more than you download' network flow, as we send them up at full multi-megapixel resolution, but browse a few of each others' at thumbnail or reduced size. And that's before we even consider video uploading (which I've noticed Comcast throttles at 0.4 Mbit/sec for me).&lt;p&gt;Comcast hit the news before by &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=comcast+bittorrent+throttle"&gt;sabotaging Bittorrent transfers&lt;/a&gt; by faking reset packets, but what Bittorrent is really doing is arbitraging around the asymmetric network bandwidth delivered by these outdated user models.&lt;p&gt;Bob Briscoe recently wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/bbriscoe/projects/2020comms/refb/draft-briscoe-tsvarea-fair-02.html"&gt;interesting proposal&lt;/a&gt; on handling congestion by TCP signalling to reveal the costs of congestion. This was&lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=1078"&gt; spun by George Ou&lt;/a&gt; as an attack on P2P protocols, but the underlying principle of penalising those who cause congestion is an interesting one. The question I'd like answered is that if I have a gigabit network at home, and the internet backbone is multi-terabit, when Comcast throttles my uploads to 400 kilobits, aren't they the ones causing the congestion?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/4936226143146995421/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=4936226143146995421' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/4936226143146995421?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4936226143146995421'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/comcasts-bialystock-and-bloom-business.html' title='Comcast&apos;s Bialystock and Bloom Business Model?'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-8685113007988968604</id><published>2008-02-19T22:44:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-20T16:55:47.056-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-02-20T16:55:47.056-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenSocial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='viral'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='viral marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networks'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='vlabfeb08'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='organic'/><title type='text'>Be Organic, not Viral</title><content type='html'>I just got back from the &lt;a href="http://www.vlab.org/article.html?aid=172"&gt;VLAB Multi-platform Social Networking&lt;/a&gt; event, which I thought was very interesting overall. &lt;a href="www.web-strategist.com"&gt;Jeremiah Owyang&lt;/a&gt; did a great moderating job, and   Jia Shen, Sourabh Niyogi, Ken Gullicksen and Steve Cohen brought  lots of different viewpoints to the discussion. Growing and deriving value from Apps within Social Networks is still full of lots of unknowns, but it was good to hear  some basic shared principles come through - my summary of one point was 'before you think about a Business Model, make sure you have a Pleasure Model'.&lt;p&gt;Another point well made by Steve Cohen of Bebo was something I've been thinking for a while too - the hunger for 'Viral' growth is a mistake - what you really need is 'Organic' growth. Just as we distinguish between Organic search results and bought or spammed ones, social network sites and their users are distinguishing between the viral apps that are essentially parasitic, using their hosts as a means to their propagation, and the ones that organically become part of the social ecology, making both the site and the users richer by their presence.&lt;br /&gt;I spent the last weekend fighting off a flu virus, partly by eating lots of organic fruit.

Here's &lt;a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html"&gt;Douglas Adams again&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;during this century we have for the first time been dominated by non-interactive forms of entertainment: cinema, radio, recorded music and television. Before they came along all entertainment was interactive: theatre, music, sport – the performers and audience were there together, and even a respectfully silent audience exerted a powerful shaping presence on the unfolding of whatever drama they were there for. We didn’t need a special word for interactivity in the same way that we don’t (yet) need a special word for people with only one head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect that history will show ‘normal’ mainstream twentieth century media to be the aberration in all this. ‘Please, miss, you mean they could only just sit there and watch? They couldn’t do anything? Didn’t everybody feel terribly isolated or alienated or ignored?’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Yes, child, that’s why they all went mad. Before the Restoration.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘What was the Restoration again, please, miss?’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘The end of the twentieth century, child. When we started to get interactivity back.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/3069567423387291163/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=3069567423387291163' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/3069567423387291163?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3069567423387291163'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/sheet-music-redux.html' title='Sheet music redux'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-6670341947840084493</id><published>2008-01-18T12:20:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-01-18T12:34:43.611-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-01-18T12:34:43.611-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shock of the new'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MI6'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Paradigm shift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MapReduce'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Luddism'/><title type='text'>Fear of the new -  the Internet, Tea, and MapReduce</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/foreign/davidblair/jan2008/policing-internet.htm"&gt;Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6 said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Al-Qa’eda has prospered and as it were regrouped largely because of the energy and effort it has put into its propaganda, largely through the internet.”&lt;p&gt;Sir Richard added that the internet had become the main channel for “radicalisation” and coordination between al-Qa’eda cells. He said: “In dealing with this problem, there is no alternative to imposing significant controls over the internet.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I call the "cup of tea" problem, after&lt;a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html"&gt; Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Newsreaders still feel it is worth a special and rather worrying mention if, for instance, a crime was planned by people 'over the Internet.' They don't bother to mention when criminals use the telephone or the M4, or discuss their dastardly plans 'over a cup of tea,' though each of these was new and controversial in their day. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have been surprised that tea was controversial, but &lt;a href="http://www.quite.com/misc/tea1.htm"&gt;William Cobbett's 1822  'The evils of tea (and the virtues of beer)' had this to say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;It must be evident to everyone, that the practice of tea drinking, must rended the frame feeble and unfit to encounter hard labour or severe weather, while, as I have shown, it deducts from the means of replenishing the belly and covering the back. Hence, succeeds a softness, an effeminacy, a seeking for the fireside, a lurking in the bed, and in short, all the characteristics of idleness, for which, in this case, real want of strength furnishes an apology. The tea drinking fills the public-houses, makes the frequenting of it habitual, corrupts boys as soon they are able to move from home, and does little less for the girls, to whom the gossip of the tea-table is no bad preparatory school for the brothel. At the very least, it teaches them idleness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the &lt;a href="http://www.databasecolumn.com/2008/01/mapreduce-a-major-step-back.html"&gt;attack on MapReduce today&lt;/a&gt;, which spectacularly misses the point by attacking a programming technique for not being a database and contains the striking line: &lt;blockquote&gt;Given the experimental evaluations to date, we have serious doubts about how well MapReduce applications can scale. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(MapReduce is what Google uses to run complex data-manipulation problems on lots of computers in parallel to do things that databases fail at, like building an index for all the webpages it has found, or rendering map tiles for everywhere on earth in Google maps).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/6670341947840084493/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=6670341947840084493' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/6670341947840084493?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/6670341947840084493'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/fear-of-new-internet-tea-and-mapreduce.html' title='Fear of the new -  the Internet, Tea, and MapReduce'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3200930.post-7569667321869067410</id><published>2008-01-09T00:59:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-01-09T01:10:36.140-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-01-09T01:10:36.140-08:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='event'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='code'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OpenSocial'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='hackathon'/><title type='text'>OpenSocial Hackathon next week in SF</title><content type='html'>&lt;div id="event" class="vevent"&gt;&lt;h3 class="name summary"&gt;OpenSocial Hackathon hosted by Six Apart &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;abbr class="dtstart" title="20080116T160000"&gt;Wednesday, January 16, 2008 4:00 PM&lt;/abbr&gt; - &lt;abbr class="dtend" title="20080116T230000"&gt;11:00 PM&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;div class="location vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="fn org"&gt;Six Apart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="adr"&gt;&lt;span class="street-address"&gt;548 4th St&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="locality"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="region"&gt;California&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="description"&gt;Find out the latest news about OpenSocial&amp;#39;s 0.6 release and what Shindig and Cajoling can do for  your next web application&lt;br /&gt;Work with developers of OpenSocial Social Networks to get your applications up and running.&lt;br /&gt;What to bring:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your laptop&lt;li&gt;Your web application code or your social networking idea&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we provide:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wifi and power&lt;li&gt;Help getting into OpenSocial 0.6 sandboxe&lt;li&gt;Developers from at least Google, MySpace, Hi5, Plaxo, and Six Apart&lt;li&gt;and don&amp;#39;t forget pizza!&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hosted at Six Apart&amp;#39;s 4th street offices, it&amp;#39;s a short walk from Caltrain and indeed the Macworld Expo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a  href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2008/01/hacking_on_opensocial.html"&gt;Six Apart's post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/402409"&gt;RSVP at Upcoming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/7569667321869067410/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3200930&amp;postID=7569667321869067410' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3200930/posts/default/7569667321869067410?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7569667321869067410'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/opensocial-hackathon-next-week-in-sf.html' title='OpenSocial Hackathon next week in SF'/><author><name>Kevin Marks</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18338939297948690534</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
