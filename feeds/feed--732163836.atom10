Why do insurance companies insist on spending so much of their advertising on TV (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;over 60% of their total ad spend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as I mentioned in the Video post below)? I’ll know more in early 2009 based on our current research effort on the Commercial Insurance industry so check back with me to see how well I do. Until then here’s a possible explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is the industry is at a similar point in its advertising thinking as Hi-Tech was 10 years ago. Because the Insurance business operates in a “sell thru” model using captive and/or independent agents they focus their advertising spend in mass market vehicles like Network TV. This is similar to how companies, like &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://h30415.www3.hp.com/index.jsp"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; spent their money ten to twelve years ago to support business partners. Spread the “Brand” as far and wide as possible so partners can sell under it. The reason they did this…feedback from partners consistently beat up manufacturers on their lack of Brand support. Partners also told them to stay out of demand gen and selling, mostly because it threatened the partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until hi-tech companies starting paying attention to partner performance. In the past, revenue from the partner channel was collected and not driven. Manufacturers did brand advertising and tossed some marketing development funds (MDF) at the channel and hoped for the best. Today, it’s a whole different world…at least for some. The channel is now a valuable and increasingly important source of revenue, especially for new customers and solutions. As a result of this new focus, manufacturers now want greater control over those investments and better returns…not to mention tracking required by Sarbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Companies, like HP have now become much more involved in driving channel sales through their channels. To a point of creating collaborative demand generation campaigns on behalf of partners...telling them what campaigns to run against which customers with what budget. As a result, the internet has become a much more important vehicle. &lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My point, HP’s B2B internet advertising spend in 07’ was 22% of the total spend (TV total was only 25%, with a little over a half going to Network). Insurance companies average spend on the internet...2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insurance companies have the opportunity and need to start thinking the same way. We’ve heard from Carriers that they have a difficult time getting captive agents to grow their book of business and sell new service lines. We also heard that when it comes to non-captive agents that they would like them to better target “profitable” customers. Both needs can be addressed by getting more involved in generating and/or directing business development at the agent/customer level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;To get started companies should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin directing the TV audience they’re targeting to internet sites with real offers just like the big boys of Fin Serv do…like &lt;a href="http://www.capitalone.com/"&gt;CapOne&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start using Web 2.0 tools to drive demand to agents, even better start helping them undersand how to use the tools. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have to spend on TV, reallocate the budget to Cable so it can be better targeted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, approach agents with a value proposition built on helping them build their business don’t just push products to them and hope for the best. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is just my opinion, but I’ve seen the movie before...or in this case, the TV commercial. Check back next year and see if I’m right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/1282124571899211525/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=1282124571899211525' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/1282124571899211525?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1282124571899211525'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/12/insurance-companiesturn-down-tv.html' title='Insurance Companies...turn down the TV!'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-5003904317432430679</id><published>2008-12-01T16:39:00.009-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-10T10:38:22.952-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-12-10T10:38:22.952-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='financial services'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='research'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='b2b marketing'/><title type='text'>Results of the 2007 B2B Advertising Spend in Financial Services Assessment</title><content type='html'>&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/q_4Izt13yvg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/q_4Izt13yvg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Scott Gillum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;We just finished our annual assessment of B2B Advertising spend in the Financial Services industry (for high resolution video &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_4Izt13yvg"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and select watch in high quality). Results for 2007 showed that as an industry, Financial Services firms &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;reduced their B2B advertising spend by close to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt; 15% over the prior year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mix of the total advertising spend was similar to the prior year with a slight increase in internet spend (9%, similar to what we saw in our Digital Marketing in FS research) and radio. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mix of print advertising as a percent of total spend (typical 30% of total spend) shifted to magazine (up to 14% from 7%) at the expense of newspapers (12% down from 21% in '06). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In sub-segments, the Retail Banks sector, already feeling the effects of the downturn, dramatically &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;cut back advertising spend last year by over 20%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Local newspapers were the hardest hit, with only half of the advertising dollars from the previous year. Consumer magazines picking up much that spend, one of the few bright spots from last year. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The internet continues its streak of growing as a percent of total spend up to 14% from 13%. A milestone was reached by CapOne, which invested more advertising dollars on the Internet than in Network TV which is the first time ever we've seen that. Could this be a trend…yea, I think so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Insurance industry no real change…unfortunately. Overall spend was only down slightly from $48M to $46M with no real change in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Local newspapers lost ground (14% of total spend compared to 19% the previous year) with magazines picking up that shift similar to what we saw in Retail Banking, but for the most part all other categories remained the same. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advertising spend on the internet was a pathetic 2%...the same as 2006. While the rest of the Financial Services industry is shifting dollars out of TV and into the Internet, the Insurance industry continues to buck the trend, in fact, TV as a percent of total spend increased last year from 60 to 62% of the budget. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to provide a reason for this (if i can) in my next blog. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/5003904317432430679/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=5003904317432430679' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/5003904317432430679?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5003904317432430679'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/12/results-of-2007-b2b-advertising-spend.html' title='Results of the 2007 B2B Advertising Spend in Financial Services Assessment'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-3893398049720808332</id><published>2008-11-21T14:58:00.016-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-03T10:19:04.515-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-12-03T10:19:04.515-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='best practice'/><title type='text'>Lines of Businesses, Verticals and Services…Oh, Boy</title><content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Scott Gillum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why can’t we all get along?&lt;/em&gt; On my flight home the other night I sat beside a woman who headed a line of business at an Environmental Waste compnay. She mentioned how they recently realigned the organization to a Verticals, LOB’s and Services model and that they are struggling with the transition…it sounded like I was talking to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made the same decision this year. After advising and helping companies tranisition their organization to this structure for years, it is only now that we are beginning to feel their pain. And boy, are we feeling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cc6600;"&gt;Here are some of the common challenges:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Everybody will be in Everybody’s business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – early on in the transition you’ll experience the “blob.” Everyone involved in the reorg will pretty much be stuck in the same place. Vertical guys will want to define products, LOB’s will want to do their own sales and marketing, etc. It will take time for the “blob” to spread out. Give it time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Lane Violations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – as the “blob” starts to spread out people will begin to find their lane. The challenge will be those who refuse to stay in their lanes. Lane owners will need to be protective of their space and tell others to "get out"…easier said than done. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;I think there for I am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – just because you’re the new head of a Vertical or LOB doesn’t mean you know how to do the job. You’ll find that it will take time for folks to truly understand what they are supposed to do…try 6 to 12 months. And for some…never. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Marketing, Selling, Scoping Work, Pricing, etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. – yep, all these functions will be debated over and over...where they best fit, who should do what, at what point in the process, etc. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Compensation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;– OMG, the elephant in the room. Yes, it will look easy on paper…Verticals = revenue…LOB’s = profit and/or contribution...Services = customer loyalty/satisfaction, but boy does it get messy. It should create a healthy tension in the organization as long as its managed with an iron fist that is covered with kid gloves. This one will take time to sort out and all those lane violators will want to make up their own rules and/or change the ones that exist. At the end of the day, err on the side of the customer and/or what makes best sense for the organization. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cc6600;"&gt;Tips on how to survive...and maybe thrive in this new world:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Clear Definitions on the Role…and how to do the job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – almost everyone will get the logic and/or rationale for the change and intuitively understand what they are suppose to do. The challenge is they may not, or most likely will not, know how to do it. I've seen this story a dozen times....created the org chart, made the announcement to the company; lay out some targets…now go. The missing piece? No one has given anyone instructions on how to do their job. Invest the time to be crystal clear on what and how you want the job to be done. It will go a long way in keeping the “lane violation” from causing problems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Hiring from the outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – it’s taken me a while to come to this but I think you may be better off hiring new blood to run the Verticals, especially if they are new. If your business is product focused and has been aimed at one or two specific industries consider hiring in talent from the industry you want to penetrate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Verticals go forward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – the role of the vertical should be to understand the needs of the industry/customers (market sensing), the positioning of competitors, manage pipeline, and position the organization/product/services value proposition to be successful. They may also own account management activities. If they do, a line should be established on how big an account should be to warrant that type of coverage (more on that later). Notice I didn’t say develop products and/or services because they shouldn’t! Vertical folks will be invaluable resources for informing new products/services and adapting existing, but they should not drift into the LOB lane…they own products. If done right they should have an idea of what customers will be 2-3 years out and should challenge the organization to catch up with offers (click below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SScbDlqmNrI/AAAAAAAAAHc/srHsGlCHUSw/s1600-h/Slide1.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271211637324789426" style="WIDTH: 214px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 173px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SScbDlqmNrI/AAAAAAAAAHc/srHsGlCHUSw/s200/Slide1.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;LOB’s go deep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – the role of the LOB should be to develop a standard set of products and services that fit common needs of customers across industry and meet a defined profit target. They may or may not own the P&amp;amp;L, it depends on the industry but they should control PRICING. Enabling the sales organization (the Vertical) with good content to support their business development efforts and informing the services/solution organization on their needs is core to their role. LOB’s should also understand which channels support what products/services and provide them with the right funding/incentive model. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Services and/or solutions go long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - this group may often feel like the orphan in this new model but don’t neglect their needs, voice or insight. Most likely, they know the needs of the clients as well or better than the verticals, and how well products/services/solutions actually work. This group should focus on serving the needs of existing customers and finding ways to improve, strengthen and expand that relationship. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Create a “Practice”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – a “practice” is a cross organizational group that is focused on supporting a Vertical. It should include representatives from the Vertical, LOB and Service/Solutions groups. The purpose of this group is to decide on how to go to market. What segments/sub-segments to target, what to sell to whom by when, and to align and/or optimize resources against revenues. This gets the three groups talking, listening and focused on running the business effectively and efficiently and it can go a long way in helping define roles and responsibilities (see graphic above). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Not every ‘customer’ needs to be in a Vertical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – small and some medium customers don’t need and/or fit into a Vertical. Their needs may not be that unique and/or warrant the type of coverage of other larger customers. Additionally, if you’re deploying a geographic vertical coverage model it just doesn’t make sense in some areas. A dense concentration of customers like the Northeast can support a vertically aligned sales force but in the upper Mid-West…forgettaboutit. Run the territory models on what makes sense. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck and godspeed. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/3893398049720808332/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=3893398049720808332' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/3893398049720808332?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3893398049720808332'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/11/lines-of-businesses-verticals-and.html' title='Lines of Businesses, Verticals and Services…Oh, Boy'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SScbDlqmNrI/AAAAAAAAAHc/srHsGlCHUSw/s72-c/Slide1.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-8196653608072365349</id><published>2008-11-14T15:56:00.018-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-11T09:25:46.165-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-12-11T09:25:46.165-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='digital marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Web 2.0'/><title type='text'>From Webcast to VODcast</title><content type='html'>&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nkpBRGTA5ws&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nkpBRGTA5ws&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In July 2001 our cost per attendee for a public or private event skyrocketed to &lt;strong&gt;$589&lt;/strong&gt; per attendee from previous year average of &lt;strong&gt;$70.&lt;/strong&gt; Attendance at our events dropped like a bag of wet cement… from an average of &lt;strong&gt;125 to 25&lt;/strong&gt;. The change happened almost overnight and we knew that the recession was ”ON”… as you probably and painfully know travel budgets and event spending are one the first things to be cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a professional services firm that sells services through the dissemination of intellectual property we couldn’t just turn off speaking at events. Seminars and events drove close to 40% of our leads so we made the decision to shift almost everything online. Typically, we would do at least 30 plus events a year. In the second half of 2001, we ran 14 web events and 2 live events. It turned out to perfect timing because 9/11 put a nail in the coffin of live events. By the end of the year we were able to double our average attendance and our cost came back down to $100 per attendee plus…we add 700 names to our “opt-in” list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to 2008, we haven’t done a webcast in the last three years. Why? Because the format became overused and the effectiveness of reaching our key audience has been severely limited. Also, business has been good…we didn’t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we did our first &lt;a href="http://market-bridge.com/Forms2/FS_registration.html"&gt;VODcast&lt;/a&gt; and more are planned. Why? Because what is old is new again but this time you can see the presenter. A bad economy means the business slows, pipelines begin to get thin and business development using events is uneconomical…see above. But here’s something else we have noticed, people are going back online looking for free advice that they used to get from “experts” when they had budgets to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also learned during the last down turn that when you use a new technology there is the “novelty” factor. People will tune in just because they’re curious which boost your registration/attendance rate but it doesn’t last long…you have maybe 6-8 months before the novelty wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I happened to be the lucky guy (if you want to call it that) that got to go first. I found the experience to be very challenging… much harder than doing a live event and/or traditional webcast. Here are a few things I learned from the experience…starting with the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;What is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_podcast"&gt;VODcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – it stands for “video on demand” and it’s a pre-record video that may or may not have other assets integrated into it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shorter is better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – the VODcast came in at a little over18 minutes, for a 45 minute presentation I did live at a conference…and it’s still too long. If I had to do it over again, I’d chop it up into 2 minute segments and make it a series…still might. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Personality/Sizzle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – you need it, and I obviously had none. I get energy from the audience…the camera gave me nothing and it shows. Got to work on that, rehearsing into a mirror sounds hokey but I think it will help. Open to suggestions here… &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Color and lighting matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – we used a conference room with bright lights and burnt sienna colored walls…not good. Learned that lesson the hard way. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Bandwidth matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - depending on the length of the video and the number of viewers you may need to check with the IT folks on the impact on your IT infrastructure. We had to move the video to a host server to handle to the load. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Communicate the format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – because this is a new format you have to explain how it works…a lot. We had calls from folks asking for the dial-in number. Communicate instructions often and on everything (email, registration page, under the event listing on your website, etc.). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is the future, so you might as well try it. I’m convinced that it will soon replace traditional web and podcast. Additionally, it provides the viewer with a much better experience…there is no call-in number, no applet to download, it eliminates many of the technical issues of the past. In fact, I’m doing a webcast today for client. I’ve already received three emails asking for the call-in number….it was sent to them days ago. Bring on the Video! &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/8196653608072365349/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=8196653608072365349' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/8196653608072365349?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8196653608072365349'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-first-vodcast.html' title='From Webcast to VODcast'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-5357792026251785968</id><published>2008-11-06T09:26:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-19T21:47:46.427-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-19T21:47:46.427-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='best practice'/><title type='text'>Best Practices from the Last Downturn</title><content type='html'>Every “expert” and every business publication seems to be giving advice on how to manage the downturn nowadays and it’s great to have those thoughts and ideas. It struck me the other day that we’ve gone through this before (remember the “Dot.com” bubble) but no one seems to be talking about what we’ve learned from that past experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I became interested in learning if there were any “best practices” that we could use to help make better decision this time around. I’ve talked to a few clients, folks here and looked at some work we did with clients during the post bubble burst years (2002-2003). From that research I’ve pulled together nine “best practices” and have listed them below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Cut Fast and Deep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – the last go around folks were very optimistic that the economy was going rebound quickly so they delayed decision or cut less than they should have given the reality of the situation. We did exactly that and went through three rounds of RIF’s needless to say it was painful and demoralizing…ever heard the expression “There are two ways to die: get shot or bleed to death?” Well, we choose the latter. This time around we went back and looked that the low point of the recession, the point at which our revenues bottomed out (let’s say it was 30%) and we took that percent and cut expenses to that level last month, even though our revenues are off forecast only by… let’s say its 15%. It gives us a cushion in case things get worse and allows us to preserve cash which we didn’t do the last time…which is the next topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/biz/Cashflow_banking/20000310.asp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Cash is King&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;– got to have it, keep it and watch it like a hawk. Customers will take liberties with payment terms and there may be nothing you can do about it. If &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dso.asp"&gt;DSO&lt;/a&gt; starts to tick up, pull down on a line of credit (if you have it…and do it now) to give yourself some cushion to absorb cash flow issues. This killed thousands of small business during the last go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Little Things Mean a Lot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – as you tighten the belt be careful what you cut. Yes, you should control travel cost and really asked yourself whether or not to you really need to be there but there are little things that you may be tempted to cut things that may mean more to your employee and/or customers than you realize. If you experience a RIF, be careful not to cut other little things that may demoralize the remaining staff. For example, if you have bagels or donuts brought in one day a week continue to do that. The cost savings is minimal and the unattended message that you may end up sending is that the company has cash flow issues…spooking the folks that remain. Keep in mind their senses will be heightened and if you have inexperienced staff (recent graduates, for example) it will kick in the fight or flight reflex. The last thing you want is the remaining employees to be unproductive because they’re job hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Strengthen the Core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – this is a great time to refocus your core business, customers, partners, markets and employees. In the good times companies have a tendency to drift away from their core…what built the business. If you’re a software company focus on building, supporting and refreshing your offerings…put the transition to a “services” company on hold until the recovery. Take a long hard look at your customers, partners and markets…are these the folks you want or will need in the future? If the business is hard to get or maintain it is expensive…think about what you can really afford. I heard through the grapevine that a profession services firm recently pulled out of 15 markets, including Asia. Their comment on doing it…”those markets will be there in the future we can reenter when its right.” This can help guide your decision with bullet #1 - &lt;strong&gt;Cut Fast and Deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Take a “Pit Stop”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – many companies have been operating with inefficiencies in their go to market engine for years. The demand for meeting quarterly performance has kept many CEO’s from taking the car off the track for a “Pit Stop.” Now is the time. It’s a good chance your stock is down and not going anywhere soon regardless of your performance so take advantage of this situations to do some work on the engine, flush the systems, and get the car ready for the next 500 miles. Actively look for opportunities to gain greater efficiencies even if it means setting aside funds as a write off. Take the hit now, &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.mastercard.com"&gt;MasterCard&lt;/a&gt; recently announced their &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/11/04/ap5647228.html"&gt;3rd quarter earnings &lt;/a&gt;and they took a $500M after tax charge to settle a lawsuit with Discover card. That lawsuit had been out there for years and was settled a while ago but they took the hit this quarter…there’s a reason. We’ve spoken to a number of CEO’s recently who said that they regret not doing this in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Adjust Your Message…Carefully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – yes, you need to realign your value proposition to today’s economic reality but be careful. The temptation is to jump to a “cost” message but not all of your customers maybe feeling the pain…yet. If you abruptly switch a message from “growth”, “revenue performance,” etc. to one of “cost savings, “ be forewarned that it can damage your brand and/or confuse your customers. Know how your customers perceive your value and how it varies by segment or type of customer (and don’t guess, do your homework) and finds ways to enhance it with key messages that play today around value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Focus on Strengthening and Deepening Relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - the good thing about a downturn (if there is one) is that it’s a great time to strengthen and expand your relationship with your best customers…and it’s worth the investment. A “spending freeze” takes the pressure off your interactions with customers. It can go from you trying to sell something to them, to you talking to them about their situation and needs. Customers may no longer be in the “buy” mode but they very well may still be in the “learn” and “shop” phase of the buying cycle so take advantage of that to introduce them to new information, services, and employees (senior executives in particular). This “value added” period can go a long way in growing your business when they start buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;You May Have to Give Some to Get Some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – your customers may need to do business with you differently during this down turn. You don’t have to go to the extent of a &lt;a href="http://searchsystemschannel.techtarget.com/news/article/0,,sid99_gci1247933,00.html"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Foremski/?p=315"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://in/"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creating special demand generation and financing programs to help partners and/or customers but think about their situation and how you might be able to help. Chances are the gesture will speak volumes and relating to the bullet above goes a long way in deepening the relationship and increasing customer loyalty. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Lastly, Prepare for the Upturn NOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – bad times, just like good times don’t last so start preparing your recovering plan now. Many companies use times like these to create an aggressive plan to gain/buy/steal share from competitors as soon as they sense the start of a recovery. Don’t become financial myopic and only focus on cost reduction. Something that we have learned from the past is that companies have a tendency to turn over the keys to the CFO in times like these and for good reason…they drive out cost, watch cash flow, etc. Unfortunately, they can hang onto the keys a little too long. As &lt;a href="http://www.ge.com/company/leadership/bios_exec/beth_comstock.html"&gt;Beth Comstock&lt;/a&gt;, the CMO of &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.ge.com"&gt;GE&lt;/a&gt; told me (in her first stint on the job) during the recovery after the “burst”; ”...finance did its job of controlling cost but it impacted growth… the CEO is looking at my role as being the Chief Growth Officer…” . &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Draft a plan and have your organizaiton commit to coming out of the downtown stronger, leaner and more aggressive than you went in to it. It will help focus the organization during this challenging time. To do that you'll need to learn from the past (see above) and be ready to invest. Now get started! &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/5357792026251785968/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=5357792026251785968' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/5357792026251785968?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5357792026251785968'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/11/best-practices-from-last-downturn.html' title='Best Practices from the Last Downturn'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-761752217098609599</id><published>2008-11-03T11:07:00.009-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-06T10:06:58.941-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-06T10:06:58.941-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='direct marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='best practice'/><title type='text'>Direct Marketing Done Right</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQ8koYQNzLI/AAAAAAAAAGs/Xte-kDejCnE/s1600-h/Boden2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264466765543230642" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 150px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 200px" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQ8koYQNzLI/AAAAAAAAAGs/Xte-kDejCnE/s200/Boden2.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000099;"&gt;Click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the image to the left. Now this is how you market in a down economy. Over the past year I’ve focused on the virtues of Web 2.0, but it’s time to give a “shout out” to ol’ school direct marketing, especially when it’s done this well. It’s from &lt;a href="http://www.boden.co.uk/"&gt;Boden&lt;/a&gt;, a children’s clothing catalog company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This letter is a virtual clinic on how to do DM right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things to love about this piece:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Quick Service Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – immediately connected to my account info…none of this nonsense of explaining who I am, they know me as a customer…and that I’ve bought, a lot apparently, in the past. Most likely, it also serves as a tracking code as well. Bonus incentive: if I use it when I call I get free shipping, which I probably would have received anyway but they’ve given me an incentive to give them the tracking code. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;The Opening Sentence/Paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – it’s about me (actually, my wife) right out the gate. You’ve maybe got 2-3 seconds to connect with the reader nowadays, and you can’t start out with what you want or who you are because the reader doesn’t care. I also know what you thinking, how is it that your wife shared a letter like this given the comments that we bought “armfuls” last year and we were “one of their best customers.” Two reasons; 1) she’s an ex-agency person and appreciates a good piece like this, and 2) the letter mentions that we’re not buying as much this year…there’s the positive spin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Use of Levity/Comedy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – this is extremely hard to do well and it is a bit edgy but I love it…makes you want to read more. The use of British humor (this is a UK based company) also adds to it. Folks have been saying for a while that the best creative has been coming out of London for years. Got to admit I’m seeing more and more evidence of that…but I also have to giving credit to the &lt;em&gt;Geico Gecko&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;a href="http://www.martinagency.com/site/C11/"&gt;Martin Agency&lt;/a&gt;) for paving the way here as well. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Personalization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – from the owner/founder &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;Johannie Boden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; herself. Have no idea what her first name is or even if she’s even a real person… could be &lt;em&gt;Tommy Bahamas’&lt;/em&gt; sister for all I know, but I like the personalization. Hands down, DM from an individual to an individual always has the best response rates. Writing good copy that sounds likes it’s coming from a real person and not just a signature, that’s another story…maybe even another post. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Customer Buying Behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – they’re obvious tracking and have noticed a change in my wife’s habits; this is critical in a down market. Watch your best customers and their transactional behavior…probably should have started last year but it’s never too late. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;The Solution/Offer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Dolla, Dolla, Bill Yo…Cash Money$$$. Look up &lt;a href="http://www.crmtrends.com/directmail.html"&gt;DM best practices &lt;/a&gt;and “the experts” will tell you that you should test multiple offers… 50% off, half off, or buy one get one free, and you should, but in today’s economy real money is a real winner. Simple, real and it can be combined with other promotions. &lt;em&gt;Ol’ whatshername&lt;/em&gt; came up with a custom solutions just for us. She determined that the most likely reason we haven’t been buying lately is price –and she’s dead on…their cloths are on the high end. Back to school this year meant going to &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.macys.com"&gt;Macy’s&lt;/a&gt; with a hand-full of 10-20% off coupons. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Limited Time Offer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – yep, got to have it. And the time period is getting shorter and shorter. Seeing an interesting trend with the use of limited time offers. This use to be the go to “hook” for PC manufactures and mass merchandisers now I’m seeing it in all kinds of retail situations, and most interesting is it's use in fund raising. Mobile opens up a whole new dimension look for that next year on &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/business/media/08googlephone.html"&gt;Google’s G1 phone&lt;/a&gt;. Instant offers feed by GPS that expire very quickly…use it now or lose it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Creative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – notice that the offer gets a third of the page, and is very colorful with offsetting large and small images. The $20 offer is supersized and next to information on where to redeem it. Your eyes are drawn to it immediately and it’s the motivator that determines whether you’ll invest the time to read the text above it. It is also perforated and complete, so if I only read the offer and tossed the top, I would have everything I need to understand and use it. Notice how they personalized the offer…”…&lt;em&gt;I run out soon.” &lt;/em&gt;Love it! &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day the ultimate measure of good DM is performance/results. In my house, it killed but then again we were an easy target…they knew us all too well. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/761752217098609599/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=761752217098609599' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/761752217098609599?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/761752217098609599'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/11/direct-marketing-done-right.html' title='Direct Marketing Done Right'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQ8koYQNzLI/AAAAAAAAAGs/Xte-kDejCnE/s72-c/Boden2.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-2409175619369371647</id><published>2008-10-27T16:34:00.014-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-03T11:33:35.761-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-03T11:33:35.761-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='customer experience'/><title type='text'>US Airlines…Nickle and Dime Nosedive</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQsln9BjOyI/AAAAAAAAAGc/_zc-OaNZ6mA/s1600-h/BusWeek+Image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5263341957838748450" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 154px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 200px" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQsln9BjOyI/AAAAAAAAAGc/_zc-OaNZ6mA/s200/BusWeek+Image.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last week I took a flight to Orlando. Since I fly a good bit and I have reached a preferred status (whatever that means) on &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.usair.com"&gt;USAir&lt;/a&gt;, I got bumped up to first class. Big deal! No meal, a 30-year-old plane, a terminal and jet port that looked out of a third-world country. I know I sound like a whiner, but hang on, I have a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The industry that led the way on defining the customer experience in the glory days of “jetting” and customer loyalty with reward cards has lost its way. In particular, the U.S. carriers are lost in a forest of &lt;a href="http://www.airlines.org/economics/specialtopics/USAirlineBankruptcies.htm"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;. As the rest of the world moves towards enhancing customer experiences and building customer advocacy, the airline industry seems to be doing everything it can to move in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the airline I mentioned above now charges &lt;a href="http://www.usairways.com/awa/Content/traveltools/baggage/baggagepolicies.aspx"&gt;$15 dollars &lt;/a&gt;for the first (yes, the first) bag check. As a result of that brilliant money making idea, we now have flights delayed because everyone is trying to jam their bag into an overhead. Or how about charging for water, tea or coffee? Brilliant. Yes, on this same airline coffee and sodas will now cost you &lt;a href="http://www.usairways.com/awa/content/traveltools/intheair/foodandbeverages/maincabin.aspx?c=hp_txt_00455"&gt;two dollars&lt;/a&gt;. On the flight down the price of beer and wine was $6; two days later on the return it was $7. It’s probably close to $10 by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you’re saying that they have to do that because of fuel cost, labor cost, etc. Well then, how is it that Virgin Airlines, in particular &lt;a href="http://www.virgin.com/News/Articles/VirginAtlantic/2008/260808.aspx"&gt;Virgin Atlantic &lt;/a&gt;in the States is able to make money in this industry despite its new planes, expansion of routes, etc. Because &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson"&gt;Sir Richard &lt;/a&gt;knows it’s about the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Customer Experience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southwest.com/"&gt;Southwest Airlines &lt;/a&gt;has turned this into a whole campaign. The strong, well managed will make the weak pay for this approach. The bottom line is that “nickel and diming” your passengers/customers isn’t going to make the airline profitable again. In fact, it will probably do the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will help restore profitability to the airlines? Well I’ve a got a few ideas: how about we start with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Innovation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;…and then good management practices and …and then decent labor contracts, etc.! &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/global_index/"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt; ran an piece on the performance of innovative companies in its September 22, 2008 edition (see image to the left) . Companies known for delivering innovative customer experiences have an average stock return of 2.5% and revenue growth of 5.1% from 2004-07. Those with innovative business models were more impressive with a 16.6% return and 7.2% growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say to the airlines, to get flying again…innovate yourself out of this nosedive…and give me back my free coffee!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/2409175619369371647/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=2409175619369371647' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/2409175619369371647?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2409175619369371647'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/10/us-airlinesnickle-and-dime-nosedive.html' title='US Airlines…Nickle and Dime Nosedive'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQsln9BjOyI/AAAAAAAAAGc/_zc-OaNZ6mA/s72-c/BusWeek+Image.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-4402735278772319259</id><published>2008-10-22T12:47:00.012-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-29T08:08:46.784-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-29T08:08:46.784-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='financial services'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='digital marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='b2b marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Web 2.0'/><title type='text'>Digital Dissonance</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQHdjQf6HdI/AAAAAAAAAGM/0Qp-OFP8bpM/s1600-h/FSFinalReport_V9_as_svc_10_17_Page_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5260729437539409362" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 154px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 200px" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQHdjQf6HdI/AAAAAAAAAGM/0Qp-OFP8bpM/s200/FSFinalReport_V9_as_svc_10_17_Page_01.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;The Digital Disconnect in Financial Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I’ve just returned from the &lt;a href="http://www.sourcemediaconferences.com/FSM08/"&gt;Financial Services Marketing Symposium&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando where I saw and heard some really interesting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I saw an affinity card program from a company called &lt;a href="http://www.serversidegroup.com/"&gt;ServerSideGroup &lt;/a&gt;that can be issued for &lt;a href="http://www.cardpartner.com/"&gt;small groups&lt;/a&gt;, like a church congregation or a local school. Second, I heard the CMO of &lt;a href="http://www.capitalone.com/"&gt;CapOne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/people/McDonald_William_4923663.aspx"&gt;Bill McDonald &lt;/a&gt;declare that “Web 2.0 is about consumers selling to consumers” which I think is great way to describe it. So if you look at these two things together you see a potential revolution in the way credit cards are marketed. In one scenario, you have the marketing scientist at CapOne trying figure out the “killer” value prop that will get you to open the third DM piece they sent you that week and fill out that credit application; all based on sophisticated models that try to figure your “profile” based on various data sources that really don’t know you from Eve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the other scenario you have Betty, who teaches your children at Sunday school, calling you about the new St. Joe credit card that will become a valuable fundraiser tool for your church…you don’t need divine powers to figure out which value prop will win. Look around your industry and you’ll probably find a similar analogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you would expect FS companies to be all over &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; right? Well you would expect that, but you’d be wrong according to our research. MarketBridge just completed an industry research project on the use of &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/Forms2/FS_Survey_FinalReport.html"&gt;Digital Marketing in the Financial Services &lt;/a&gt;industry. The research was conducted in partnership with &lt;a href="http://www.sourcemedia.com/"&gt;SourceMedia&lt;/a&gt; the publisher of &lt;a href="http://www.americanbanker.com/"&gt;American Banker &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bondbuyer.com/"&gt;The Bond Buyer&lt;/a&gt; and other FS focused publications. The study drew nearly 250 respondents across a variety of titles and functions within financial services. Nearly 40% had executive-level titles and close to 20% had marketing budgets of $100 million or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what we found out;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Marketing is in the Driver’s Seat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;… More than 60% of respondents said they had a “reasonable” to “very good” understanding of digital marketing. When asked how organized their companies were to plan and implement digital marketing strategies, more than half said they were “adequately” to “well organized.” Over 90% of the respondents said Marketing was the key influence in driving the Digital Strategy. Nearly two-thirds of the group said that a Centralized Marketing organization owned the strategy, and nearly that many said Marketing owned execution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;But it’s using Web 1.0 tools and platforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;… Half of the respondents said they spend 0-10% of their budget on digital. The majority of respondents (65%) are spending the most on what they are familiar with, mainly their own Web sites. Relatively few (15%) are spending toward “Web 2.0” vehicles like blogs, social networks, video, etc. The situation in the Insurance industry is even worse, with Insurance companies on average only spending 2% of their advertising budgets on the Internet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not the reg's or the legal department, only 35% cited regulatory issues as a top concern. The majority of respondents said their top concerns were lack of experience with new digital marketing platforms, and the inability to prove ROI. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;The Root Cause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;… They’re not investing enough time, money and resources to do the necessary piloting to learn how to use the platform and tools, develop processes or do reporting . It’s a chicken and egg thing. Spend on those things that have a proven result even though they are, for the most part, only measurable at the tactical level and not at the campaign or program level. Show short term results vs long term success. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;The Fix&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt; Long term programs (…and I’m talking a year or more) aimed at key market segments with clear value props. By taking a long term approach marketers will be able to experiment with Web 2.0 tools because they work best over time, not in a short term campaign. Think I’m making that up? We’re working with a leading Insurance company now on a 3 year long program. It involves a dozen or so partners, aimed at Boomers for a product that they won’t be able to sell to some folks in the segment for another 2 years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In the current environment, FS institutions have to be focused on creating deeper more meaniful relationships with customers. They need to be focused on creating customer “advocates.” Firms that take a “wait and see” approach to going Digital will see their customers disappear and their traditional marketing tactics become less and less effective as they sit on the sideline waiting for the perfect ROI. Creating Customer Advocates for the brand, products and services is the goal because it's all about…or soon to be all about &lt;strong&gt;Consumers selling Consumers&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got to go, Betty’s on the line… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/4402735278772319259/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=4402735278772319259' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/4402735278772319259?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4402735278772319259'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/10/digital-dissonance.html' title='Digital Dissonance'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SQHdjQf6HdI/AAAAAAAAAGM/0Qp-OFP8bpM/s72-c/FSFinalReport_V9_as_svc_10_17_Page_01.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-5932001096984236379</id><published>2008-09-23T15:18:00.016-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-22T13:56:52.741-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-22T13:56:52.741-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='financial services'/><title type='text'>Fallout of Financial Services Mess</title><content type='html'>Wow, what a couple of weeks it's been for the Financial Services industry. Investment Banks have disappeared, the government owns the world's largest insurance company and Congress is debating whether taxpayers should foot the bill to get us out of the largest financial debacle since the great depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what might all this mean to sales and marketing folks in the industry? Our &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/_res/pdf/FS_Launch_Release_Final.pdf"&gt;Financial Services&lt;/a&gt; practice and I have spent the last week and a half looking at the changes and have come up with a list of potential areas that may be impacted...negatively or positively. I've even gotten feedback from a colleague in Europe on what this might mean internationally. Keep in mind that the crisis is shifting everyday, so this is like trying to look over the horizon while standing in quick sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Greater regulation across the industry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will reduce the number of 'innovative" products making it more challenging to differentiate by product. As a result, companies will need to increase the importance on competing through superior distribution, and having an unique segment aligned value proposition. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;A greater need for solution sellers vs product pushers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – In this environment, sales channels with reps that can sell value will be essential. " Additionally, the need to sell new services “bundles” necessitates more sophisticated reps. Product Pushers" who sell on price will continue to erode already pressured margins. We may also see someone like Progressive use their direct model to commoditize more products/services perhaps some low end products in the Commercial Insurance market. If you are an agency or broker, move up the value chain to selling sophisticated service solutions. Wholesalers and/or Aggegrators may help facilitate that shift. Relationships are still key but "best price" will continue to be the key consideration driver. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;A significant need to lower the cost to sell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Increased regulation most likely will add cost and/or impact margin. Companies will have to find a way to do more with less. They may also look to new lower cost channels to distribute products. Relationships + low cost, self service channels = success. Because solution sellers are hard to find and more expensive, there will be a focus on finding ways to create “leverage” for channels/reps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Customers will have greater leverage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– Good customers will be in the driver’s seat. They will be more cautious, demand greater value and lengthen sales cycles. Profitable customers will be highly valued and targeted, see bullets 6,7, and 8. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;New risk models or new underwriters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – There may be a need to rethink how companies evaluate, take on, sell and/or manage risk. This may also be impacted by new regulations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Improved segmentation &amp;amp; predictive modeling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Cost pressure and increased competition will force the need to improve targeting, increase yield of programs and campaigns, and get the most out of existing customers (increasing cross sell and upsell opportunities). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Increase focus on retention and loyalty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;– Investment banks, now bank holding companies or a part of a Retail bank will now have to fund their activities on customer deposits rather than "funny money". Look for them to come after your best customers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;New competitors, "Super Banks' &amp;amp; consolidation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Look for the pace of consolidation to pick up with the recent changes. The banking landscape has changed with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley becoming bank holding companies. This sets them up to either acquire banks themselves and/or merge or being acquired. Existing players, such as BofA and Barclays, are picking up the pieces that will help them expand services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;My colleague, Mathew Stewart in our London Office chimes in;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Safety in geographical diversification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;--Major international banks will seek a more geographically diversified portfolio. Being active in U.S. and Europe is not sufficiently diversified to protect against the crisis, as UBS discovered. Those who were strong in China, India, and Brazil have faired better. For example, HSBC’s huge U.S. write-offs were counterbalanced by spectacular gains in their Asian operations, so their shares have stayed stable. Santander, a European bank, has faired well due to its involvement in Brazil, and is now buying up businesses from cash-strapped competitors, e.g Royal Bank of Scotland. Some of the bigger banks will seek to copy HSBC and Santander – most do not have sufficient reach, and are more likely to merge with a domestic competitor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Domestic mergers lead to channel rationalization headaches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. More domestic banking mergers mean more headaches around how to combine two different sets of distribution channels. These are tough decisions. Huge investment has been sunk into branch networks, a regulated sales forces, broker networks and brands. Exit costs are very high. Banks need a rational basis on which to base their channel rationalization decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;You’ve killed your partner channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; What do you do now? Over the past 10 years many of the reputable agents and intermediaries have come to rely more and more on cheap credit deals for their income. When the banks stopped lending they were the first to go bust – not just the charlatans and quacks, but some good people who will not now come back to the market in a hurry. When the bank is ready to expand again, how do they rebuild the partner channel? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Look again at Buy vs. Build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Mergers also present dilemmas for product portfolio managers. There are make or buy decisions for different product categories-- e.g. should a bank sell its own general insurance? Difficult to know what will happen here. Will the drive for more transparency in investment products actually extend into all FS products?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/5932001096984236379/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=5932001096984236379' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/5932001096984236379?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5932001096984236379'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/09/fallout-of-financial-services-mess.html' title='Fallout of Financial Services Mess'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-7932387632899484229</id><published>2008-09-09T16:16:00.014-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-06T16:50:19.576-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-06T16:50:19.576-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='research'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='customer experience'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='white paper'/><title type='text'>The Customer Experience...and why your company can't deliver it</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SMbzl1gkmnI/AAAAAAAAADw/ZbkTzmcHYj8/s1600-h/Customer+Experience.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244146647463926386" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/SMbzl1gkmnI/AAAAAAAAADw/ZbkTzmcHYj8/s200/Customer+Experience.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Let the bloggin resume, thought that you might enjoy hearing this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What your customers (and your sales force) are trying to tell you about the customer experience&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick up any book on Customer Service and the first tip on how to improve or provide a good customer service experience is to “listen to the customer…” This advice is so incredibly obvious and intuitive that you shouldn’t need a book to tell you that! Yet putting it into practice is incredibly hard to deliver. &lt;em&gt;Why? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;customers want...at least one company's customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We recently completed a project for a Transportation Company on improving its customer service operation. Our task was to find out what their customer wanted in a good customer service experience. We surveyed over 500 customers, conducted multiple focus groups and held one-on-one interviews. And after all that data collection, what did the customers say they wanted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wanted the company to…get ready for this…”know them.” Know them and their business, and have an understanding of their business so that you can anticipate their needs and be a valuable partner. Doesn’t sound too difficult to deliver, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this company’s case, it is difficult. They have no customer service standards and no rules to govern interactions. Oh, they also lack a centralized customer database or incentives to capture and archive customer conversation and data. To make matters worse they deliver customer service in a decentralize environment with over 100 centers, all operating independently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that scenario you would think that this company could implement some simple fixes that would have a big impact—and there are some simple fixes. But what is interesting is why the company is in this state in the first place. When you get to the core issue you begin to understand the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its core, this is an operations driven company, and customers can sometimes get in the way of efficiency. Their culture and core operating model is to move a box as quickly as possible from point A to B without damaging it. Customers who have special needs and/or require assistance slow the process down. In this company’s environment, delivering good customer service can sometimes be too costly and/or too inconvenient. The bottom line is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;the process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is more important &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;than the customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does this tell us? Well, it may begin to explain why your company can’t deliver on customer expectations as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the introduction to a white paper on improving the customer experience that will be released soon.

Howard sent me an email looking for some thoughts on entering new markets. I thought it was appropriate to share that question and my response as my first post in nearly a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howard's questions was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#ff9900;"&gt;I am trying ot market our products into a few new markets. What will be the best way to do it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;My response was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entering into new markets is very difficult unless you have existing customers who have other divisions that are currently serve those industries. So I’d suggest that you first start looking at your existing customers that fit that profile…if, you haven’t already. Get introductions into those industry verticals from your existing customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, focus on those industries that have similar needs to the industries you are currently serving…we call it “adjacencies”. Remember “new” takes a long time and is costly. Try to find ways to eliminate “newness” …e.g. new customers, new needs, new applications, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Howard and look for a new post next week. &lt;strong&gt;I'm back!&lt;/strong&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/5649617490627542017/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=5649617490627542017' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/5649617490627542017?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5649617490627542017'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2008/09/thank-you-howard.html' title='Thank You Howard'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-705782381199859218</id><published>2007-10-18T08:58:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T13:28:46.503-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-09T13:28:46.503-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing sherpa'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='b2b marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='demand generation'/><title type='text'>A New World for B2B Marketing</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RxdpV4MEXVI/AAAAAAAAADM/9aQsDv9V8wc/s1600-h/logo.png"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5122678925738401106" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RxdpV4MEXVI/AAAAAAAAADM/9aQsDv9V8wc/s320/logo.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I just returned from speaking at the &lt;a href="http://www.sherpastore.com/B-to-BDemandGenerationSummit.html"&gt;MarketingSherpa's B2B Demand Generation Conference &lt;/a&gt;in Boston and I came away very encouraged about the future of B2B marketing. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the first time I am seeing B2B marketing attract top talent. B2C has gotten more than its fair share because of the attractiveness/sexiness of life in Advertising, the CPG industry, and other Brand/Creative centric areas. Top Schools like &lt;a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"&gt;Kellogg&lt;/a&gt; have been sending their best and brightest into those jobs for years while over in the world of B2B, marketing has been seen as the red headed stepchild to the favorite son Sales. Outside a few companies in Hi-Tech, B2B marketers were usually guys who couldn’t cut it in sales, senior executives who were parked in marketing until retirement, or young attractive women in sales support roles. But the times are a changing…big time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the rise in interactive marketing, new digital media, and the need to measure ROI, the world of B2B is now attracting serious talent. Young marketers are now coming into the space. They understand how to use the tools of Web 2.0 to build communities, how to better communicate concepts and ideas, and how to measure the impact of these efforts. They are now becoming smarter at understanding buyer behavior and how to tap into it, influence it, and measure it with tools. Maybe even smarter than the chosen ones…&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/705782381199859218/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=705782381199859218' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/705782381199859218?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/705782381199859218'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2007/10/new-world-for-b2b-marketing.html' title='A New World for B2B Marketing'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RxdpV4MEXVI/AAAAAAAAADM/9aQsDv9V8wc/s72-c/logo.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-2050848650865860643</id><published>2007-04-23T09:28:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T16:31:09.140-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-09T16:31:09.140-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CMO'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ROI'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='research'/><title type='text'>Sneak Peak - CMO Report Highlights</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RizEXmYW9GI/AAAAAAAAAC8/e5TD2nARhvc/s1600-h/def_align_report_thumb.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5056632391348974690" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RizEXmYW9GI/AAAAAAAAAC8/e5TD2nARhvc/s200/def_align_report_thumb.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/resources/define_and_align_form.asp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define &amp;amp; Align&lt;/strong&gt; the CMO &lt;/a&gt;report is avaliable to today after 2 years in the making. The report actually turned out to be more interesting than we orignal thought based on our working hypothesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year-long research by the CMO Council and MarketBridge encompassed qualitative and quantitative interviews with CMOs, CEOs, board members, senior marketers and executive recruiters throughout North America. The 80-page report, priced at $295, along with a complimentary executive abstract, is available for download at &lt;a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/"&gt;http://www.cmocouncil.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a teaser of some the insights coming out of the research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=6864&amp;amp;KeyWords=cmo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Confusion over the role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;- the casualty rate of Chief Marketing Officers can be reduced if CEOs and boards better understood the role, requirements and value of a CMO and empowered the right individuals to architect all aspects of a company’s operations around the customer experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A Fixer Upper"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - the report points out that title inflation, unrealistic expectations, flawed hiring practices, talent deficiencies, and lack of requisite business and strategic leadership skills are big contributors to the limited shelf life of CMOs. The research also points to the fact that 50 percent of executive searches are to replace incumbent CMOs who are primarily hired to fix broken marketing organizations, not drive business value. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R-E-S-P-E-C-T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - the study uncovers startling contradictions in upper management: most executives consider the CMO a valued member of the executive team, yet they also believe many &lt;a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=6864&amp;amp;KeyWords=cmo"&gt;CMOs lack the background and skills needed to be a top management &lt;/a&gt;player - a challenge numerous senior marketers share with their CIO counterparts at many companies. Additionally, in a sharp commentary on the connection between strategic value and performance, most CMOs involved in top-level decision-making get high marks from their CEOs for their overall performance, while those CMOs who remain in tactical mode get significantly lower grades. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show me the Money!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - nearly three-quarters of the C-suite executives surveyed consider the marketing organization “highly influential and strategic in the enterprise.” At the same time, nearly two-thirds also say their top marketers don’t provide adequate evidence of ROI with which to gauge marketing’s true performance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Getting a Grade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - In a clear sign of the strategic role played by marketing executives, nearly 70% of the CMO respondents to this study report directly to their CEO. However, only 40% of that number get an A grade for their performance from the CEO...most likely the ones who could demonstrate their value! For the most part, CMOs get more respect from the boardroom than from the CEO. Most of the board members surveyed, over 80%, believe that within the next two years, the CMO position will gain greater credibility with the rest of the management team. But in another reality check, less than 20 percent also say that an increasing number of CMOs will rise to the CEO position&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Longer Tenure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - A majority of the recruiters surveyed believe that CMOs have a shorter shelf life than other C-level executives. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;average tenure of CMO respondents to this study was 38 months&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(In a past report, the search firm Stuart Spencer pegged the number at 23 months). We had a professor from a top business school involved in our research...he's a data/analytics guru. He was also familiar with the Stuart Spencer report, here's a dirty little secret...CMO's your tenure is longer than what SS reports. Don't believe the hype...they are an executive placement firm. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If CMOs do face an &lt;a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=6864&amp;amp;KeyWords=cmo"&gt;identity crisis&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not for lack of marketing competence or creativity – the CMO leadership capabilities and talent levels in the surveyed companies are higher than ever,” said Tim Furey, CEO of MarketBridge. “Rather, the identity crisis stems from a perceived lack of measurable results.

Furthermore nearly three-fourths said their sales forces spent 50 percent or less of its time in direct contact with customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Top three strategies for growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Introducing new products or product extensions (45 percent); reorganizing the sales organization (39 percent); changing the focus on customer or market segments (35 percent). That said, exactly one-third said they had “high confidence” in their companies reaching their growth goals in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Greatest customer demands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Companies are strained to offer “new products at reduced prices,” and to follow up on those offerings with “better service.” Further, more than a third (34.7 percent) said they were just “somewhat prepared” to deliver on those customer demands. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study will be highlighted in the May edition of &lt;em&gt;Sales &amp;amp; Marketing Management&lt;/em&gt; magazine.

Here's one man's cynical view of how the "game" works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big agency wins account using outsourced, incredibly talented "pitch team", really innovative creative, and a promise of a global platform which promise to improve the "message", create synergies, improve spend, etc. The client drinks the "kool aid" but then quickly comes to realize that it was a &lt;em&gt;sham.&lt;/em&gt; The account manager is not the person who pitched them and starts to do a very good impression of the "invisible man". The once huge and skilled account team is also disappearing, being replaced by a staff that contains mostly fresh faced kids just out of school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The account relationships sputters along with marginal performance. The client BU’s and Regions get fed up with the "Global Platform" (never getting the attention and team promised) and start going outside using smaller, smarter and more valued agencies (who happened to have the talent who have recently left a big agency…after being purchased). And the innovative "Creative" they showed to win the account turns out to be the only creative thing they've produced in the last few years (oh, and it was created by a smaller specialize agency).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big agency realizes the account is at risk and begins acquiring the small agencies that are serving the client to secure the account. If the client is willing to commit to retaining the agency after all this...they promise to win them an award and get them really good concert tickets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#660000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR's Turn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ok, now it's PR turn in the barrel. But I think the thing that is going to most threaten the PR firms is new PR software vendors/tools like &lt;a href="http://www.vocus.com/content/index.asp"&gt;Vocus&lt;/a&gt;. They threatened to disintermediate them because in the past PR firms traded on the tact that they knew who to contact, about what and when. Tools like Vocus are taking a little mystery out of the PR magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They contain a database of key media contacts, contact tracking, links into channels like PR Newswire, etc. Everything you need to "do it yourself". But Scott, what about the relationship that PR firms have at the media outlets that you're targeting? Forget about it. Here's the bottom line...relationships don't matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Media "establishment" has no loylaties...they take want they need to meet a deadline. If you make it easy for them, give them something of value (something that meets the 3 "C's" critirea) and/or help them out in a pinch...you have as good a relationship as anyone else. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the threat? I think the smart companies are going to start bringing more and more of the PR activities back in-house. Most likely, it will start in small and mid-tier sized companies and will work its way up the ranks. Combine this with the framentation of media, smaller niche players targeting specific market segments, Web 2.0 technologies and you have a situation where companies will be able to get their message to their target audience better then ever and at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not a betting man, but this one looks like a sure thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's to a successful and profitable 2007&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/704795561422746488/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=704795561422746488' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/704795561422746488?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/704795561422746488'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2007/01/pr-firms-youre-next.html' title='PR Firms - You&apos;re Next'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RZ7Za_JCRpI/AAAAAAAAABY/3qpv-7eB0aU/s72-c/bullseye.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-8169332002846879862</id><published>2006-12-21T09:07:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T16:41:25.192-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-09T16:41:25.192-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Web 2.0'/><title type='text'>Web 2.0: Please!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RYqarXRe9YI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Bk54VWFICcY/s1600-h/For+Complex+Selling+with+Multiple+Decision-Makers+and+Long.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5010987605175498114" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RYqarXRe9YI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Bk54VWFICcY/s200/For+Complex+Selling+with+Multiple+Decision-Makers+and+Long.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I am soooo over the hype on the "second coming" of the Web. So here's my Christmas present to you. Do you want to know what Web 2.0 is about? OK, so many of you may be saying what the hell is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good question, the media has been hyping it for what seems like an eternity but I still haven't seen a good simple explanation. Some like BtoB magazine are even calling it a "Revolution".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what I think 2.0 is really about ...&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;about creating an engaging and useful web experience that is designed by the user community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...and of course, all the web tools/applications to enable this (Blogs, Podcast, social networking, etc.). Yes, that's it. Creating opportunities within your site to let visitors give you feedback on their experience -- and you (Company X) actually paying attention and doing something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you don't have to wait until the hype and new technologies start rolling out to build your own Web 2.0 site right now. In fact, you probably already have pieces of "Web 2.0" in site right now. A few tips for getting started:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Track/Determine Interaction Time and/or Engagement Level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- go beyond measuring typically web metrics (traffic, clicks, etc.) to measuring Interaction Times. Determine not only if the visitor is returning to your site but also how much time are they spending on it. You also need to understand where they have come from, your sales process by product, where customers spend their time (in what channel to learn, shop and buy) and finally, how long it takes (on average). As you can see from the graphic above, in Hi-Tech customers surf among channels (both online and offline). Complex sales, as you would expect take much longer and consume more Face-to-Face resource time. Oh, by the way, the research done to produce this graphic was conducted for a client in 2003. So much for the "revolution" of Web 2.0. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Build Information "Depots"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - if you want customers to give you feedback, give them something to respond to and an opportuntity to do so by giving them vehicles/channels to communicate. HP is experimenting with giving IT professionals new media tools such as &lt;a href="http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/underhill/"&gt;Blogs&lt;/a&gt; to engage with customers. And &lt;a href="http://www.intuit.com/"&gt;Intuit&lt;/a&gt; has created a feedback button called "We Hear You" that enables Quickbook users to submit product feedback. Keep in mind, if you want something of value (information) you have to give something of value. If you don't have an even exchange you will not get the information you want...so get those offers together (white papers, research, etc.). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Go beyond Community Building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - You'll hear a lot of hype around "communities" and many of you probably have robust user communities. Get the communities more involved in building, testing and promoting your products, website, campaign,etc. Start measuring "Net Promoters" - a metric of customers who would recommend your products. Word of mouth is still THE most powerful marketing tool, but with &lt;a href="http://www.womma.org/ethics/"&gt;recent regulatory changes&lt;/a&gt;, be careful on how you motivate customers to sing your praises. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Leverage Existing Tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - years ago we started to leverage an Online Training tool called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://presentation.brainshark.com/powerpoint-presentations-index.asp"&gt;Brainshark&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It allowed us to create On Demand sales and marketing presentations using PowerPoint and a phone...very simple and convenient. But the most valuable part of the tool was the tracking. We were able to see who was viewing the presentation as soon as they opened it, how long they viewed it, how many pages and who they sent it to, etc. We able to measure the interest levels inside a company, decide on who to pursue and predict when we would acquire the account -- all by watching how people interacted with us in a "virtual" world. This functionality now resides in most Webcast tools so make sure you are taking advantage of your investments in Webex, Placeware, etc. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before, At and After the Web&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- think about what information you want to collect at each of those stages. Also, think about what you want the visitor to see and retain in each of those areas. &lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the "customer experience"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Organize and integrate your activities by segment (customer, product, etc.) against these three stages to create a seamless experience that reinforces your message. With complex products/solutions, for example, each stage should communicate a portion of the total message, and subsequent stage should reinforce the previous stage. Breaking the message up into pieces and then, hopefully, rebuilding it in the mind of the visitor piece by piece as they go throught the buying process. So a customer may see a TV ad, then visit your website and finally call you contact center to place the order. You must anticipate, plan and, hopefully, direct the customer buying behavior to drive the response, conversion, close and yield rates. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that Web 2.0 is not "revolutionary". The concept is not new, in fact, if we had to do the first round of the Web all over again we would of done it this way...let your visitors/customers design your website the way they want to use it. But what might be different this time is that I think we are ready to listen to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great holiday! Talk to you in the New Year. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/8169332002846879862/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=8169332002846879862' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/8169332002846879862?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8169332002846879862'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/12/web-20-please.html' title='Web 2.0: Please!'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RYqarXRe9YI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Bk54VWFICcY/s72-c/For+Complex+Selling+with+Multiple+Decision-Makers+and+Long.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-5801150162473563137</id><published>2006-12-14T11:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-21T14:00:27.243-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2006-12-21T14:00:27.243-05:00</app:edited><title type='text'>CRAP - The Secret to Quick Execution?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RYrZO3Re9bI/AAAAAAAAAAs/V2PJf2wQzC0/s1600-h/Picture2.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5011056384781776306" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RYrZO3Re9bI/AAAAAAAAAAs/V2PJf2wQzC0/s200/Picture2.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over the years I've marveled at the speed at which some organzations are able to go from concept to in-market execution...and those who can't seem to get out of there own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dell, for example can "turn the ship on a dime"...changing promotions, campaigns, and the sales compensation plan for telesales reps within a day or two in order drive greater revenue or profitability based on quarterly performance projections. Other companies struggle for years to get a campaign or product out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why does this happen and what are the keys to quick execution? Beyond corporate culture, which is a major contributor to the ability to execute, there seems to be four essential elements that I like to refer to as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRAP Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ffff00;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;reate&lt;/strong&gt; - one of the things that I've noticed over the years is how efforts can stall or be delayed at the starting point. Getting past the starting gate is typically the hardest and most difficult point in the process. Anxiety builds, expectations are high, everyone is looking for the "big idea"...it all adds up to a huge speed bump slowing the creative process. Lower expectations for the first draft by getting something-anything into a first draft, no matter how ugly right after the discussion or at some point on the&lt;strong&gt; first day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ffff33;"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;efine&lt;/strong&gt; - after you have the draft, send it around for comment, refining the concept as it goes from person to person. The chain is email and the document is in word; it's important to use the edit feature. It's like a game of "hot potato" - you only get so much time to hold onto the email and then you need to through it to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ffff33;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ct&lt;/strong&gt; - the most important point in the process is getting it 70% completed and then get it into the market and/or to a customer and let the market/customer complete the other 30%. Define the "70%" mark early in the process so you know how far to go. Give the team an expectation on the timing (within 3 weeks, etc.) to be in market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ffff33;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;erfect&lt;/strong&gt; - yes, perfect the product or campaign after it is in market. Sounds counter intutive, right, but companies do it all the time...Microsoft comes to mind immediately. The key is setting the expectation on peformance before you launch. Define performance at each stage of the process so that you know what to go back and refine/fix. Too many companies get caught up in trying to create something "perfect" internally without customers or market input. The age of what I like to call the "Incremental Perfectionist" is upon us. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll also need to build your teams around this concept. You need to identify the skills sets and personailities of your team and designate a couple of "starters" (the creative types), the "refiners"(usually specialists - product, industry, etc.), and the "perfectors" (anal types who love the detail). You may find that this approach trumps any typically"Org Chart" approach in creating a high performance team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other important thing to remember is if you are afraid that someone is going to scream about a mistake or poor performance then you don't have enough going on inside your organization. The key is to have lots of activities at various stages, if some are failing, no one will notice because the high performance (Perfected Stage) programs give you air cover to refine the underperformers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone at IBM once said; "if you are going to fail...fail fast". The real key is go fast at every stage, the best companies learn more from failure than success...they also know how to get CRAP done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/5801150162473563137/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=5801150162473563137' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/5801150162473563137?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5801150162473563137'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/12/crap-secret-to-quick-execution.html' title='CRAP - The Secret to Quick Execution?'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RYrZO3Re9bI/AAAAAAAAAAs/V2PJf2wQzC0/s72-c/Picture2.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-6977195358833748203</id><published>2006-11-29T16:33:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-21T14:03:34.619-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2006-12-21T14:03:34.619-05:00</app:edited><title type='text'>Performance-based Contracts:  Buyer Beware Part I</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/7567/618413727071529/1600/331624/beware.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/7567/618413727071529/200/543166/beware.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promise of a “performance-based” contract or a “risk sharing” agreement sounds so appealing on the surface but does it really live up to its lofty billing? Do customers really only “pay for performance”? And/or get what they are paying and if so, what does it take to make that contract work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc66;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Promise &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The concept has been around for many years and has been used successfully in the Public Sector and Health Care industries. Additionally, it has also been a very successful way to sell certain commodity products. More recently it has caught on with companies providing web and tele services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MarketBridge research on the prevalence of this pricing model shows that in marketing, online marketing services are dominated by “pay for performance”, especially in the area of search and advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trend is also carrying over to non-web based lead generation services like teleprospecting. With companies offering performance-based or risk sharing models, it seems like a good business decision when spending precise and sometimes hard to track marketing dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not so quick! It does sound good on the surface but read on to find out how it can go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc66;"&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Risk” Contracts &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I recently had the opportunity to assess an outsourced lead generation program for a Fortune 500 company. The CMO of the organization was frustrated with the performance of the vendor and was close to terminating what had been a relatively successful 5 year relationship. Before that occurred, she asked me to assess the operation and the performance of the vendor, including the new Performance-Based Contract with an “At Risk” clause… recently forced on the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After visiting the operation and evaluating the program I concluded that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc66;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. the vendor was actually performing exceptionally well given the situation&lt;br /&gt;2. the performance-based clause in the contract was causing counter productive business practices,&lt;br /&gt;3. the reason the vendor was not hitting their lead targets was actually the client’s fault and not the vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting part of the story that the CMO didn’t realize was that the vendor had 5 years of response data (by campaign, tactic and channel) including lead conversion rates by campaign type. The vendor also had very precise and predictable conversion rates for each stage of the pipeline. It was only a matter of flowing the right volume of responses from campaign activities into the top of the pipeline to create the number of leads needed to meet the target. All very predictable and a perfect set up for a performance-based contract, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except there was one major problem…guess who was supposed to create the responses? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;That’s right -- the client!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This tele-qualification program was an inbound group that qualified responses coming from the client’s marketing efforts. Unfortunately, the client was not producing enough response for many reasons: under performing campaigns, inconsistent campaign activity with some months being totally dark, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a vendor to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;They start running their own campaigns to fill the gap because they don’t want to see their fees get hit. Here’s the not so funny part -- their marketing campaigns start outperforming those of the client. Ha, Ha …the client is paying the vendor to follow up on their campaigns’, the only problem is that when they do the vendor loses productivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor now doesn’t want to follow up on certain campaigns that it knows will be produce less than 10% response rates (because its own programs are producing 14%). Keep in mind the vendor owns 5 years of campaign response rate data it also can predict the lead yield from the client’s campaigns and so it begin to decline to participate in certain campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor has now turned the tables on the client and is actually holding the client to its own version of a “performance-based” metric for campaigns, except it doesn’t tell the client that and it appears to the client that the vendor is now not only underperforming but also hard to work with because it doesn’t want to do certain things it knows are of low value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you starting to see the mess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc66;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making it Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, create a real partnership with your vendor. Don’t put them in a situation where the performance clause of risking fees is used as a threat. A true “At Risk” model can be very appealing to senior management but may make the day-to-day vendor managers life a living nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to create an “At Risk” clause, be willing to add the “At Reward” clause as well. I’ve seen plenty of companies go for the fees at risk but balk at paying for performance that exceed targets. If you’re not willing to pay for the upside then don’t bother with the downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, performance-based contracts can be a win for everyone just know that a vendor can’t do it all by themselves. It takes two to dance “the high performance dance” and if you’re not willing to do the “Tango” the dance can turn ugly. You start stepping on toes, tripping over each other and dancing to a different tune. I’m talking real ugly…think Jerry Springer on &lt;em&gt;Dancing with the Stars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/6977195358833748203/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=6977195358833748203' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/6977195358833748203?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/6977195358833748203'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/11/performance-based-contracts-buyer.html' title='Performance-based Contracts:  Buyer Beware Part I'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-2735185003374452565</id><published>2006-11-17T12:17:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-25T09:05:20.878-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-25T09:05:20.878-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sales effectiveness'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ecomonic downturn'/><title type='text'>After the Party: The Corporate "Hangover" Caused by High Demand</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/7567/618413727071529/1600/Hangover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/7567/618413727071529/200/Hangover.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when you had a unique product, a top-notch sales force, customers who couldn’t get enough of your product and were willing to pay anything for it. Sales reps coudn't close deals fast enough and the factory couldn’t keep pace with the orders. Little to no inventory cost, high margins, an incredibly productive sales force, big bonuses, soaring stock, etc...things couldn't be better. But what happens when demand begins to slip?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things to occur is that your best customers, who in the past had no leverage, begin to feel the advantage shift their way and sales reps (unknowingly and for the most part unwillingly) help that transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As demand cools, good sales reps who are trained negotiators and born manipulators, begin turning their finely tuned sales skills on the organization. Feeling the pressure to close business and meet quota, reps begin "selling" the organization on what they need in order to get the deal done. Instead of driving customers into existing solutions with a premium price, they take the course of least resistance, demanding that the organization bend to meet the customer’s (not the company’s) requirements. The company “customization” party goes on for as long as the sales quotas exceed market demand for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;The Hangover Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the company look like after the party? Unfortunately, like most good parties, the news of the festivities grows and involves most of the organization. At the end, it is not a pretty site and it take years to clean up. Here's a list of the mess left behind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Large contract departments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– When demand is high, customers typically agree to standard terms and conditions in order to get the product as quickly as possible. As demand slows customers begin to try to gain leverage by modifying the “T’s &amp;amp; C’s” of a contract to their advantage. Reps desperate to get the deal signed before the end of the quarter apply pressure to the legal and contract departments to accept customer terms. This results in contracts so complex to manage, that additional staff is needed to administer them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one hi-tech firm, for example, it takes a staff of four to perform administrative tasks related to just one large customer contract. Multiply that by twenty large customers and you begin to see the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;2. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Complex product and price configurations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– In the eyes of the customer, the value of the rep shifts from problem solver and solution provider to personal customer advocate. The same demand for customization of “T&amp;amp;C” is applied to product configuration and pricing arrangements. The result is highly customized solutions, hard-to-write service agreements, and complex payment terms that may end up costing the company money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The response from the product management team of an ATM manufacturer working on standardizing product configuration was: “We have been trying to do this for years, but the sales force wouldn’t let us.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Order Taking vs. Order Making&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;-- A nasty side effect of this hangover is that when demand slows it reveals flaws that would otherwise had been hidden. One of those is seen in the quality of the sales force. The difference between “order takers” and “order makers” becomes apparent in a slow marketplace. In this environment of longer sales cycles and fickle customers, sales reps must work harder than ever for the sale that doesn’t hold much appeal for reps who are used to making quota without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sales rep at a one-time highflying manufacturer of telecom and web equipment was overheard saying in the hall to a colleague; “&lt;em&gt;...I’m afraid we are back to the bad old days when customers required a business case and ROI for every purchase decision...” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;4. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;A Service Nightmare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– When product configuration becomes so highly customized, it limits the number of service reps who have the competency to work on the equipment. This results in long service times. Worse yet is when service reps turn over, new reps, which lack the knowledge of the original configuration, begin applying short term service “band-aids” that sacrifice product performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, complex product configurations bring complex service agreements. As is the case for orders, service contracts become incredibly difficult to administer and manage. For example, one customer of an equipment manufacturer demanded that each component of the product have its' own unique service agreement…all 200 parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Remarketing vs. Marketing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– Marketing gets the opportunity to host the party. Because demand for most products already exists, marketers focus their efforts on having fun catering to big customers and satisfying the whims of the sales organization (big expensive customer events, sponsorships of sporting events, etc.). Their activities are nothing more than “remarketing” to existing customers to keep the party going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the downturn comes, marketing is stuck with pre-conditioned customers and reps who are looking for "fun" and "fluff". Unfortunately in this environment, marketing never develops the types of programs and core competencies needed to effectively sell products and acquire new customers right when the company needs it the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Cure for the Hangover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It’s not the hair of the dog that bit you that’s for sure and unfortunately, this hangover does not respond to a quick fix like a couple of aspirin or a new technology. Here are a few tips for getting started:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Map out a plan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– you didn’t get into this overnight and you're not getting out quickly. Start small and stay focused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Find/Create opportunities to standardize and/or simplify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;– force events such as technology implementation or new product introduction to standardize process, price and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Understand that not everyone is going to make it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– the hiring profile for reps and managers 10 to 20 years ago when the sales force was built may not make it – order takers vs. order makers. The service and marketing departments may also need retooling. New competencies, skill sets and training are also necessary for those who make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Utilize new sales and marketing channels and retrain existing channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – introduce and pilot new sales and marketing channels that increase customer coverage, reduce overall sales cost, and improve customer acquisition. Help field sales reps find their “sweet spot” (closing large complex orders in new accounts) by providing training on multi-channel coverage models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Draw a line with customers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Analyze and determine the profitability of your customer base. Segment it into three groups: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;profitable customers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unprofitable but could be profitable given some minor changes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unprofitable with no hope &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin the process of re-conditioning the way customers in segment #2 buy. You’ve created the monster and now you have to tame it. In segment #3, begin the process of terminating the relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it is like any hangover. You feel terrible, you have a few (or a lot) of regrets, you promise to yourself and others that you'll never do it again -- but...it was fun while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/2735185003374452565/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=2735185003374452565' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/2735185003374452565?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2735185003374452565'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/11/after-party-corporate-hangover-cased-by.html' title='After the Party: The Corporate &quot;Hangover&quot; Caused by High Demand'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-1959110973318153416</id><published>2006-11-16T10:00:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T16:40:32.766-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-09-09T16:40:32.766-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='b2b marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Performance Dashboard'/><title type='text'>Dashboard Disaster: Not a Storybook Ending</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RZ68KfJCRmI/AAAAAAAAAA8/2o7PLrkvW6g/s1600-h/frog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5016653923281421922" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RZ68KfJCRmI/AAAAAAAAAA8/2o7PLrkvW6g/s200/frog.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;OK, so yesterday I went on a bit of a rant about Performance Dashboards --let me tell you a story that will, hopefully, explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time there was a Prince named CMO and he lived in the magic kingdom of Marketing. The kingdom of Marketing was under attack from the kingdoms of Sales &amp;amp; Finance. The kingdoms were fighting over the "holy grail" of performance and ROI. So the Prince decided that he would build a Marketing Dashboard that would lead him to the Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prince commissioned a band of Knights called Consultants to lead the crusade and help him search the world for information. This journey was difficult and exhausted much of the Prince's fortune but finally, the Knights built the Prince a magnificent and magical Dashboard...and the Prince was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prince showed the Kingdoms of Sales &amp;amp; Finance his Dashboard and they were impressed. He told them that he was close to discovering where the Holy Gail of performance and ROI was hidden. Every month the Prince met with his people to talk about the Dashboard, and ogle at its magnificence but then, one day, something happened. The Dashboard started to lose its magic. The Prince and his people could not make it better and it steadily got worse; the Prince and the Kingdom of Marketing were very concerned and unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prince of Sales started to question the magnificence of the Dashboard and the power of Prince CMO. Prince Finance believed that the magic Dashboard was showing him how Prince CMO was squandering the wealth of his people. The Prince was under attack and eventually, he lost his kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is that a Dashboard is not the "holy grail" of performance and ROI. CMO's are under a tremendous amount of pressure to show the organization how they are providing value and producing a positive return on what can be very sizeable investments (3-6% of revenues). CMO's believe that they need to have the data to prove their case...and they are right. The difficult part is knowing what to do with the data once they have it, and how to move the numbers in the right direction. Although the story above is written as a fairy tale, it is based on a true story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing that a CMO can do to improve the performance of marketing is teach/train country marketing managers the basics of pipeline management because it is their results that show up on the Dashboard. Effective pipeline management is built on four key principals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Volume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - the flow of incoming response, leads, opportunity coming into the pipeline &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Conversion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - the percent of opportunity that makes its way from one stage to another &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Cycle Time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;- the average time it takes for opportunity to move from one stage to the next &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Transaction Size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - the average order size of the opportunity closed &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If CMO's can effectively coach their teams on how to manage by these prinicipals then they will have achieve the "Holy Grail"...and they will get to keep their kingdoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a link to a related article on the subject - &lt;a href="http://chiefmarketer.com/crm_loop/survey-shows-121505/"&gt;dashboard article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/1959110973318153416/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=1959110973318153416' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/1959110973318153416?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1959110973318153416'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/11/dashboard-disaster-not-storybook-ending.html' title='Dashboard Disaster: Not a Storybook Ending'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_sTe-XmR7Luc/RZ68KfJCRmI/AAAAAAAAAA8/2o7PLrkvW6g/s72-c/frog.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-4783042478849603171</id><published>2006-11-15T09:24:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-25T09:01:22.714-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-25T09:01:22.714-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='best practice'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Performance Dashboard'/><title type='text'>Top Ten Truisms of Business</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/7567/618413727071529/1600/top%2010.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/7567/618413727071529/200/top%2010.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last 20 years, I've had the opportunity to work with some of the best...and worst companies in the world. One of the things that I have found most interesting in working with clients is that certain themes seem to be consistent regardless of the company, industry or geography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;The TOP 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Corporate Culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- is directly related to the CEO. He or she sets the tone that everyone else emulates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Trust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - is the difference between a dysfuncational and a high performance team. If you can not trust the people you work with and/or who work for you, you can not perform at the highest level. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;80/20 Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - the Pareto Principal always, ALWAYS applies, whether it is revenue, profit, sales, etc. The question is, as an organization how much time, effort and resources are being dedicated to the top 20% of customers? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;No New Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - if you are an established company that has been in business for 10 years or more you can achieve your revenue and profit objectives solely based on doing a better job of capturing the opportunity in existing accounts (see the 80/20 rule). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;10-15% of Revenues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- if you are in a mature marketplace and you have to use marketing to acquire new customers, sell new products, etc. know that it will not product more than 10-15% of your total revenues. The other 85-90% will come from the sales channels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rule of 70%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- given the speed of today's market, competitors, and customers, getting a product and/or marketing campaign/program 70% complete and out the door is good "enough." Let customers/prospects complete the rest of the 30% for you. Less internal debate and more customer feedback makes for successful programs and products. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;NEW does not mean BETTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - everyone loves something new but it is the last thing that any company should focus on. Building/ selling/thinking NEW takes too long, cost too much and will have the lowest ROI. Focus first on getting more out of existing...and then invest in new (see 80/20 rule..again). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Elephant in the Room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; syndrome - there are big problems impacting performance in every organization that everyone knows about but no one talks about or attempts to fix. They will treat the symptoms but not the core problem...call it career preservation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Risk Tolerance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - fast growing and "best in class" companies have a culture of tolerating risk and/or failure. It is a HIGHLY valuable and a very real competitive advantage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Performance Dashboards&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;- we recently completed a research &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge-sf.com/dls/download4.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;with the &lt;a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/index.html"&gt;CMO Council &lt;/a&gt;that &lt;a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/SUBSECTIONS/programs_renovate.html"&gt;surveyed&lt;/a&gt; over 400 CMO's in companies over $500 Million in revenue. 50% of the responders said that they have a Dashboard and 38% said that they were working on one. Here's the truth...they don't have a dashboard; they have an excel based "Report Card" of what they did, where they spent marketing dollars and what they got in return (hopefully). The reality is that a real Dashboard has real time information and can allow you to forecast at least 30 days forward. If you are part of the 38% who is actively working on building one, figure out how to move the needle on the dial before you expose your performance to the rest of the organization. Don't show everyone in the organization your "numbers" until you know how to move them in the right direction. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/4783042478849603171/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=4783042478849603171' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/4783042478849603171?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4783042478849603171'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/11/top-ten-truism.html' title='Top Ten Truisms of Business'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5066045252169973135.post-8026005749739054105</id><published>2006-11-14T15:08:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-16T11:10:14.370-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2006-11-16T11:10:14.370-05:00</app:edited><title type='text'>Can you successfully team inside sales and field reps?</title><content type='html'>Many B2B companies have created "hybrid" coverage models to help leverage the field sales organization and to improve the economics of covering certain types of customers. Those companies are now questioning the model. The problem appears to be that the "users" and the "funders" of the program have very different perspectives on how value is being delivered and demonstrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the key challenges appear to be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does this model have value if it does not own its own products and/or customers? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there certain "sweet spots" where it has been able to prove value and/or improve the perception of the value of the model. If so how? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can "users" better communicate the value to "funders" so they see the return?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/8026005749739054105/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5066045252169973135&amp;postID=8026005749739054105' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5066045252169973135/posts/default/8026005749739054105?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/8026005749739054105'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/2006/11/many-b2b-companies-have-created-hybrid.html' title='Can you successfully team inside sales and field reps?'/><author><name>Scott Gillum</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15267370982402033551</uri><email>sgillum@market-bridge.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
