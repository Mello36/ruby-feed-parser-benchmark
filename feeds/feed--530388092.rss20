      <description>&lt;p&gt;
   Today four more sites and blogs have started their contests in the the &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/blogger-magic/" target="_blank"&gt;HP
   Magic Giveaway contest&lt;/a&gt;. Are you ready for some more chances to win and spread
   some magic?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.bostonpocketpc.com/images/posts/Day14oftheHPMagicGiveaway_BD72/hpmagicgiveaway.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img title="hp magic giveaway" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="250" alt="hp magic giveaway" src="http://www.bostonpocketpc.com/images/posts/Day14oftheHPMagicGiveaway_BD72/hpmagicgiveaway_thumb.jpg" width="354" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://eliax.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Eliax&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Here is their contest translated into English:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Here it is finally, the official list of which described to compete in the contest
   of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://66.163.168.225/babelfish/translate_url_content?.intl=us&amp;amp;lp=es_en&amp;amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2feliax.com%2findex.php%3f%2farchives%2f5883-La-Magia-de-la-Navidad-por-parte-de-HP-y-eliax%21%21%21.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic
   of Christmas with HP and eliax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;They notice that the offerers whom they have but of a number in the list are because
   they completed an additional task, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://66.163.168.225/babelfish/translate_url_content?.intl=us&amp;amp;lp=es_en&amp;amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2feliax.com%2findex.php%3f%2farchives%2f5884-Tarea-1-y-notas-de-la-Magia-de-la-Navidad-de-HP-y-eliax.html" target="_blank"&gt;like
   this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. They notice that no longer shipments of the Task are accepted
   but #1, nor to enter the contest.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;If your name does not appear in the list it is because you did not send your request
   before the stipulated date, or because your request did not fill the necessary requirements,
   or because you did not follow the instructions well when to send the required information.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;They notice that it is possible that arises another task but from now until when
   we publish the winners day 17 of this month, so they are kind. Also they are kind
   to but the news on the contest in the course of these days, including but engineering
   data of the prizes, as well as details on as the winners choose themselves.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Meanwhile the important thing that they know is that the number (or numbers) next
   to your name, is your number of lottery, and if it leaves that number you gain the
   prize of that drawing. As we mentioned previously, there will be 6 drawings, reason
   why the possibilities that you win are quite good (approximately one of each 300,
   or one of each 150 for which they completed the task #1).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Now, some peculiar data:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;- 1.222 people are competing. 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   - 612 completed the first task successful. 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   - Therefore we have 1.834 numbers in game. 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   - The offerers represent 27 countries. 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   - There are offerers of until India and Indonesia! 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   - The countries with but offerers, from the major to minor are: 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Dominican republic - 39,93% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Spain - 11,95% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Mexico - 10,72% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Argentina - 7,04% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Colombia - 6,63% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Venezuela - 6,46% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Costa Rica - 4,66% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Chile - 3,27% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   Peru - 1,88% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   The USA - 1,31% 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   - Peculiarly, in daily visits to eliax.com, Dominican Republic it is third party behind
   Spain and Mexico, and nevertheless in this contest they are those that but are participating!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Luck and we followed in contact!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   For more details on their contest in its native form head &lt;a href="http://eliax.com/index.php?/archives/5932-Mas-oportunidades-de-ganar-con-la-Magia-de-HP-y-Eliax-en-navidad!.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://geeksroom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;GeeksRoom&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   This is also loosely translated&amp;#160; into&amp;#160; English:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;It is why the spirit of this contest has like final mission that the person who
   wins demonstrates her solidarity and shares with they need which it, or a friend,
   a aid organization, a hospital, in short, always we will find somebody to whom to
   help and is in you following the spirit of this promotion and contest.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;We would like that the one that gains the contest shares some PC and all must
   be conscientious of which a person is not going to use all the computers and donating
   one or several of them they can help to whom they need if it.&amp;#160; As or I said in
   the previous paragraph, a aid organization, a hospital, a friend, a club, in short,
   all we have near which needs aid and the winner will have the gift to make happy to
   one or several people.&amp;#160; I clarify to them that they do not have any obligation
   to do it, but remember that the spirit of this promotion is to help others, to have
   the power that us dá a prize of this type to be able to make happy to others.&amp;#160;
   They remember, is not obligation! but it would be a good action from the winner!&amp;#160;
   In addition, they will see that the desición to donate a PC or several, will give
   more possibilities them of gaining the prize.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Next they can read the rules to participate in the contest.&amp;#160; They must work
   just a little bit but he is not nothing of the other world:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;1) In order to participate in the contest they will have to send a digital photography
   in which you with the logo appear of GeeksRoom and the one of the Sponsors, along
   with the legend in Spanish” I want to share the Magic” or in English “I want to share
   the Magic”.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; They are Creative, but they do not use Photoshop (only for
   some adjustment of color, brightness, it contrasts, but it does not stop to add other
   elements to him).&amp;#160; According to its creativity and according to my criterion,
   they are possible to be won up to 5 entrances (numbers) extra for the drawing!&amp;#160;
   The logos and the legend must be well visible! and the 150 photographies do not have
   to exceed Kb (they keep the original ones).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;They can unload them to the logos following the connections (they follow the connection
   All Sizes and they will see the image in his original measurement there):&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://66.196.80.202/babelfish/translate_url_content?.intl=us&amp;amp;lp=es_en&amp;amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.flickr.com%2fphotos%2fel-cowboy%2f3099775780%2f" target="_blank"&gt;GeeksRoom
   logo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

   with A and it finishes with A), B) in which alive country (if they do not know it
   to this height, says Cowboy to me) and C) that marks of laptop I have bought the past
   week.&amp;#160; The first two are easiest and third it is very obvious.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;3) All that one that decides to donate one of the PCs, 2 entrances (numbers) to

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Question a):&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;They remember to enclose the photo!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;If receipt incompletos data or lacks data and/or requirements, will be disqualified
   and they will not participate in the drawing.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;6) To each one of the entrances arrival of the email will be assigned to him to
   a number by order.&amp;#160; The same will be the one of the row that occupies in the
   Excel list which I will take with the object of organizing the contest.&amp;#160; The
   extra entrances, if to correspond, they were assigned in correlative form.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Each contestant will post their stories on their own blogs or vlogs for all of
   us to go read or see. Use the Mr. Linky widget below to sign up. Fill out the fields
   as requested, using the url for your &lt;strong&gt;post&lt;/strong&gt;, not your site. (This is
   very important... do not link to your blog, but the post specifically written for
   this giveaway within your blog!!! If you don't know how, please ask in the comments...) &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;It would be great if all the contestants would visit the other blogs in this contest
   to show some community spirit. Not saying that I care, but the judges might... Feel
   free to share your favorite posts back here in the comments section. If you have a
   Twitter account, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sugarjones"&gt;&lt;em&gt;follow me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and
   the other contestants. Our hash tag will be #SugarMagic&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Tell us what you are doing to make an impact on the lives of others. It doesn’t
   have to be a Save-The-World kind of story. I just wrote about an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://livingintheory.blogspot.com/2008/12/refrigerator.html" target="_blank"&gt;ordinary
   refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; that helped me and many others. But saving the world
   is not off the table, either. Brian Carter will tell you all about &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onedayforhumanrights.com/?p=494" target="_blank"&gt;One
   Day for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; today… if you have a minute. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Tell us what you are planning to do with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/blogger-magic/products.html" target="_blank"&gt;all
   this great hardware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I mean, there’s A LOT of hardware. More than
   one person could possibly ever need. How could all of these gadgets impact the lives
   of others that you know? How could these gadgets help you in personally inspiring
   or empowering others?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Winners will be chosen by a secret panel of ineligible (but still pretty nice)
   people. This group of wise and whacky women will read through all posts and follow
   the comment trails, so be nice out there…&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;First and foremost, I need to tell you this: while our giveaway is based on a
   random chance, I want you guys to understand the reason our site decided to participate
   in such an amazing giveaway. I’ve been &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/08/life-is-good/" target="_blank"&gt;blogging
   all this week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; about the reasons we are so grateful this holiday season.
   I will continue to do so throughout the rest of this week. FireDad and I have recognized
   how truly blessed we have been in the past few years. We have two healthy, happy children.
   We have &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/09/life-is-good-in-this-house/" target="_blank"&gt;a
   house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We are having &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/10/life-is-good-when-you-can-have-any-kind-of-christmas/" target="_blank"&gt;a
   Christmas of our own&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We are in love with one another and with our
   family. We are so blessed. And as such, we want to share that feeling with your family.
   But we don’t want that feeling to stop there.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;We know that we wouldn’t be as blessed as we are if people wouldn’t have taken
   time to share things with us along the way. The table my parents gave to us when we
   got our first apartment. The meals the ladies of the church brought to us after LittleBrother
   was born and I didn’t have enough time to shower let alone cook a healthy meal. The
   leads for freelancing jobs that others have shared with me because they felt that
   I would be best suited. The friendship others have extended to us over the years.
   Without those little bits of sharing, we wouldn’t quite be the family that we are
   today. And that’s why we believe so intently in the true meaning behind this contest: &lt;strong&gt;sharing
   the magic&lt;/strong&gt;. While we can’t demand that our winner share the package with anyone,
   we’d really like to promote that idea. I won’t tell you who and how to share but I
   will delete all entries that say, “Gimme gimme.” I reserve the right to do so!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;All that said: I’ll need you to visit the whole &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/hp-magic-giveaway-info/official-rules-for-hp-magic-giveaway/" target="_blank"&gt;list
   of rules for the giveaway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, of course, but here’s the rundown on how
   to enter!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;1. Leave a comment on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/11/stop-drop-spread-that-holiday-magic/" target="_blank"&gt;this
   post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; explaining what winning this package would mean to you and your
   family in these tough economic times and how your sharing of this package would contribute
   to the true meaning of the season. This counts as one entry. You may only leave one
   entry in this fashion. IP addresses are recorded. Obvious spoof IPs will be disqualified.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;2. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; this
   contest with this tinyurl ( &lt;strong&gt;http://tinyurl.com/sdbgiveaway1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;)
   and the hashtag #SDBGiveaway. You may tweet up to twice per day. Come back to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/11/stop-drop-spread-that-holiday-magic/" target="_blank"&gt;this
   post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; and paste the URL of each individual tweet you post. (I will
   check every single one at the end of the contest so do not delete.) Each tweet, up
   to two per day, will count as one entry. (How to get the URL of each individual tweet?
   Click on the “time” that your tweet was entered. It follows your actual tweet. “3
   minutes ago” is an example.) And, not necessary, but feel free to add me on twitter.
   I’m &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/firemom" target="_blank"&gt;FireMom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;3. Digg, Stumble or otherwise promote this contest via some form of social media
   (other than the twitter entry above). Come back to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/11/stop-drop-spread-that-holiday-magic/" target="_blank"&gt;this
   post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; and paste the URL of each individual promotion along with your
   username in case things get confusing. Each promotion will count as one entry. One
   promotion per social media site.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;4. Blog about this contest on your public blog telling your readers a longer version
   of the comment you left in entry option #1. Meaning: Blog about what this contest
   means to you and your family this year and how sharing it would impact friends and
   family. Include a link back to this post. Please come back &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://stopdropandblog.com/2008/12/11/stop-drop-spread-that-holiday-magic/" target="_blank"&gt;this
   post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; to post the link to your permalinked post just in case my blog
   doesn’t pick up your track back. You are allowed to do this once and it will count
   as one entry.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      Google also increased their coverage of the US that has Street View. From the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/street-view-year-in-review-and-whats.html" target="_blank">Google
      Blog</a>:
   </p>
        <p>
          <em>Today marks our biggest launch of Street View imagery to date: we're doubling
      our coverage in the United States. Several states — Maine, West Virginia, North Dakota,
      and South Dakota — will be getting the Street View treatment for the first time. We've
      also added imagery for Memphis, Charleston (SC), and Birmingham, and we've filled
      in lots of gaps across the country.</em>

   Google also increased their coverage of the US that has Street View. From the &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/street-view-year-in-review-and-whats.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google
   Blog&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Today marks our biggest launch of Street View imagery to date: we're doubling
   our coverage in the United States. Several states — Maine, West Virginia, North Dakota,
   and South Dakota — will be getting the Street View treatment for the first time. We've
   also added imagery for Memphis, Charleston (SC), and Birmingham, and we've filled
   in lots of gaps across the country.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;em&gt;So here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to ask you to tell me what you would
   do with this prize package. And I’m going to encourage your to share at least some
   of the love by giving one or more of the computers to a friend, family member, or
   colleague who could really use it or by choosing a charity, non-profit, or other group
   that you think should receive one or more of the PCs. The contest is open to anyone

      you can skip this step). &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;em&gt;Write a post in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.liliputing.com/forums/index.php?topic=264.0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP

   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;That’s it. Becoming an active participant in the forums will make me like you
   more, but I’m not going to assign a point value to the number of posts you leave,
   because I don’t want to encourage lots of mindless posts in the forums. there’s a
   great community of netbook and mobile computing enthusiasts hanging out at the forums
   though, and I’d encourage you to participate or at least read some of the interesting

               &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;This is finals season (I bet you thought it was the holiday season) so that’s
   what you’re going to tell me about. The first requirement:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me your best finals story.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the craziest, funniest,
      most poignant, most surprising, shocking or just plain interesting thing that happened
      to you during this week that we all look forward to with equal anticipation and dread?
      I will then share some the best ones (winner or no) on the site at the end of the
      contest. This can be the time the guy next to you fainted in the middle of an exam,
      you aced a test because of a fact you heard on Jeopardy, or the time your computer

   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Second, I am not requiring that entrants be college student bloggers this time,
   but that doesn’t mean that I’m not looking after our community. The next requirement:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must make a meaningful comment on at least one blog in the directory. &lt;/strong&gt;Maybe
      there’s one from your alma mater or your school’s rival. Maybe someone just has a
      cool title. This shouldn’t be hard, but it can’t just be “I agree” or “Cool story.”
      A substantial contribution to the conversation. You might just find a blog you want
      to keep following. Send me the link to the post(s) you commented on. &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Finally, I want you to join the 50 sites doing this business in the giving spirit.
   This is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://studentbloggers.org/hp-magic-giveaway/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;$6,000
   of stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and not even the biggest nerd among you needs four new computers.
   No chance. So the last requirement:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about the college student or high school senior who is about to
      go off to college who you would like to share at least one of these computers with.&lt;/strong&gt; This
      can be someone who needs a newer computer to compete in their discipline, someone
      who can’t afford a computer at all and spends his days resuscitating puppies, someone
      with a physical addiction to World of Warcraft, whatever. Just make it thoughtful
      and meaningful. I don’t want to hear sob stories though. I sympathize with what your
      best friend is going through, but I’d rather hear about how they are a good person
      and would do good things than the string of tragedy following them. Besides, it’s
      easy to fake a sob story. No begging. Stay positive. Again, keep it relatively short. &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Email your entry to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="mailto:studentblogs@gmail.com" target="_blank"&gt;studentblogs@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with
   the subject: &lt;strong&gt;HP Magic&lt;/strong&gt;. You must get the subject right as I will be
   filtering these. Oh, and the final rule: &lt;strong&gt;no whiners&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;I will then choose 10 or 20&amp;#160; great stories and great people (depending on
   the number of entries) and let &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://random.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;random.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; do
   the final selection. &lt;strong&gt;All decisions are final&lt;/strong&gt;. I will not be listing
   the final group, only the one winner. I do realize that people could just make up
   stories and people, but I trust that you are aren’t huge turds who would do such a

   of the children&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So three things:&lt;/strong&gt; 1) Sweet finals story, 2) link to comment on
   student blogger’s post, and 3) who you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entries must be in by Sunday, December 14th&lt;/strong&gt;. As with the last
   contest, my friends and family may not enter, but they can certainly do so on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/blogger-magic/blogs.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;other
   49 sites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Good luck and I look foward to reading your great stories! Full details, including
   info on shipping and taxes, will be available on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://studentbloggers.org/hp-magic-giveaway/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP

        <div>For most influencer's, scheduling times at CES is often a difficult process because
      you end up traveling from one end to the other of CES as well as those appointments
      that are on the strip at all the hotels. The travel time alone limits us to the number
      of folks we can visit and often times an appointment is missed because of the difficulty
      of getting from one place to another. Because of that, I would try to see as many
      companies as I can at CNTRSTG. CNTRSTG came about because a group of high ranking
      influencer's had so much difficulty meeting with a large group of companies. Their
      idea has been well received and has companies like HP, AMD, Skooba and ProClip to
      name a few that are taking advantage of it.

      Imagine, rather than a company meeting 20-30 times in a day giving the same briefing,
      having the ability to meet with a group of influencer's and present once or twice.
      Novel idea, huh? It saves those giving the presentation the repetition of doing it
      20-30 times a day and for the influencer's, they have just one place to go. In the
      final analysis, the influencer's will not be run down, tired and annoyed trying to
      get to a half dozen places all over the strip. They will be fresh, relaxed and more
      apt to be more receptive to really listening to the ideas presented to them and then
      writing good solid news items.<br /></div>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
   Today there are 3 sites participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/blogger-magic/" target="_blank"&gt;HP
   Magic Giveaway contest&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; each site has their own rules so read them carefully
   and good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;For this contest, I have a few very simple rules: &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;My contest is open to all inhabitants of this planet, known severally as Earth
         or Terra or Sol-3. Please be advised that we tend to favor sapient inhabitants. However,
         if a troglodyte’s entry is the best, then we have no choice….&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Create a short animation describing the HP Magic Giveaway, and the good it will
         bring to you, and a few lucky persons/organizations you so decide to re-gift to this
         Christmas. &lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;An acknowledgement of HP and Microsoft for this giveaway immediately attaches
         mondo points to your score.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Working in a group of more than one, letting us know that there will be more than
         one enjoyer of this giveaway is a boon.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Gratuitously praising me may or may not work.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Staying on points 1 &amp;amp; 2 matter more than anything else.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Be prepared to assign certain usage rights to me, and by proxy,&amp;#160; AbsoluteVista.com
         and all our related websites, including but not limited to SmallBizVista.com, and
         this website, SmallBizWindows.com. My statement of the assigned rights can be found &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://absolutevista.com/forums/t/754.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,
         and the assignment of these rights are non-revocable. Your submission&amp;#160; of your
         original content will be taken as agreeing with that assignment of rights statement.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;If you are an immediate member of my extended family, sorry, you are immediately &lt;b&gt;DQ’d&lt;/b&gt;.
         for you can certainly afford a system.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;I am going to attempt to review as many of the giveaway items s possible. However,
         since I want the winner(s) to have their winnings by Christmas day, I will be mindful
         of the time constraints imposed on shipping, and make sure that the systems are shipped
         in time for enjoyment of that day.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;The contest starts at 12.00 am on December 8, 2008.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;I will receive submissions until 12.01 am on December 14, 2008, and I will make
         my decision on the winner before 11.59 pm on the same day.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Oh, &lt;strong&gt;my decision is final&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;I’m holding my Magic Giveaway Contest as a WIN &lt;b&gt;AND SHARE THE MAGIC CONTEST&lt;/b&gt;.
   You’ve probably heard the phrase “random act of kindness”. Well, during this holiday
   season, I’m hoping that some lucky winner will be able to perform “deliberate acts
   of kindness”. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;My contest starts today, December 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. You have until Friday, December
   12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; at 6pm Eastern Time US to submit your entry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you want to enter my contest, here’s the deal&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;First&lt;/b&gt;, think about your less fortunate friends, parents on social security,
   local Boys and Girls Clubs, group homes, senior citizen housing with rec rooms and
   imagine the joy and surprise that gifting multiple people with a new, state of the
   art computer might bring to them. I guarantee that as you watch them light up, you’ll
   light up and that THAT feeling lasts a long time. (You can’t fix the economy, but
   you can sure help somewhat forget it for a while. My hopes are that you’d keep just
   one of these great state of the art leading edge machines for yourself, but SHARE
   THE MAGIC and gift the rest.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second&lt;/b&gt;, you need to post some images on FLICKR or a Video/slide show on
   YouTube. (And only on those sites) showing the places these new computers will go
   or a shot of the computers they are replacing (and if you replace a computer, please
   give THAT to someone who needs it). &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third&lt;/b&gt;, after you post your digital entry, send an email to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:magicgiveaway@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;magicgiveaway@gmail.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with
   a link to the location where you’ve posted this (full URL, no tiny URL or shortcuts
   allowed) and the subject&lt;b&gt;: I want to share the magic&lt;/b&gt;. In addition to placing
   the link to your content as the first line of the message, please describe &lt;b&gt;in 150
   words or less who you want to gift and why&lt;/b&gt;. I don’t want to read sob stories.
   If you don’t use the correct subject or write a novel, you will be disqualified. Be
   sure to send your email from an address that you check often for incoming mail and
   add &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:magicgiveaway@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;magicgiveaway@gmail.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to
   your safe/approved senders list so that if you win, you won’t miss the notification.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fourth&lt;/b&gt;, by entering, the winner agrees to provide me, within two weeks
   of receipt of the prize, at least a 500 word postable story on what happened when
   they gifted computers. Pictures optional, but would be great to have along with permission
   to post. I won’t post names without permission or any other information. The winner
   agrees to allow me to use the content they provide in any manner I choose.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fifth&lt;/b&gt;, winners must provide a bona fide shipping address and not a post
   office box. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth&lt;/b&gt;, the winner agrees, by entering my contest, to allow me to contact
   their local newspaper/TV station, etc. and ask if they are interested in running a
   story on the winner and the magic sharing of the holiday season. You’ll get the admiration
   of your peers and some local recognition. It would be great if, after the winner is
   notified, that they provide any info they can on contacting local media in their home
   town.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seventh &lt;/b&gt;, I will pick a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; place
   entry. I will notify the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; place winner via email and they will have
   12 hours to respond. If no response is received, I will notify the next in line, who
   will have 12 hours (etc.). I won’t post info until the winner has accepted&lt;b&gt;. Here
   is a hint: if you enter my contest, you should check your email every few hours starting
   on Saturday December 13 so that you don’t miss THE BIG NOTIFICATION.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      Wow!!! All I can say is that we are really impressed by the open hearts and amount
      of giving people are willing to do especially in these tough economic times. Many
      entries were to give away the entire prize if they won. We at <a href="http://www.bostonpocketpc.com" target="_blank">Boston
      Pocket PC</a> feel really honored and privileged to be part of the <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/blogger-magic/blogs.html" target="_blank">50
      participating sites</a> with the help from <a href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank">HP</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzcorps.com" target="_blank">Buzz

      have been too hard) and chose to go with a random drawing from all the eligible winners.

      This is how the drawing was done. All eligible entrants were entered into a spreadsheet,
      then sorted alphabetically to eliminate time of entry, then placed in a <a href="http://www.random.org/lists/" target="_blank">list
      randomizer</a> , which assigned a random number, then a random number was chosen at <a href="http://www.random.org/integers" target="_blank">random</a> selecting
      our winner.  And the moment you are waiting for...

        <p>
      Our winner is <b>Evan Brammer</b>.

          <i>I have the privilege of working for a fantastic education organization in Indonesia
      that builds high-quality international schools for the wealthier Indonesians and then
      uses that money to benefit the less fortunate. These are referred as "pelita"
      schools.  I teach at Sekolah Pelita Harapan in Lippo Cikarang.  My wife
      and two kids moved with me here half a year ago from the States to be a part of this
      great work.  </i>

          <i>What is great about what the Foundation does is that they take the money they "make"
      from the higher level "pelita" schools to then build two other types of
      schools: "dian" schools for the middle class (these schools break even as
      far as funding goes) and then "lentara" schools (where all of there funding
      comes from outside sources because the students families are unable to pay for an

          <i>The mission of the Foundation is to build ten pelita schools, one hundred dian
      schools, and one thousand lentara village schools.  What is great about the lentara
      schools are they are completely free to the students, most of which would have no
      opportunity for an education.  They are in Indonesian villages and while they
      are staffed with high quality Indonesian teachers, they still have very limited access
      to quality resources.  That is where the magic begins.</i>

      leaders of this burgeoning nation) a jumpstart into 21st century learning; helping
      them to not only be content consumers, but more importantly content producers. 
      We would use it to create dynamic kml tours for Google Earth for geography and blogging
      for English.  We could then use those and many more resources that the students
      and teachers create to pass down to both the dian and lentara village schools.</i>

        <p>
          <i>We (my class) would donate one of the laptops to a nearby (or faraway) lentara
      village school so that the teachers and students from both my school and the lentara
      school can exchange ideas, lessons, and friendships.  This would greatly benefit
      both parties as the lentara schools would have better access to content and the pelita
      students would be able to have a greater knowledge of a constituency here in Indonesia
      that all too often is forgotten: the village poor.</i>

          <i>For the remaining computers (and Kung-Fu Panda), they would most likely be used
      as tools in one of the three levels of schools.  I can see the Mini 1000 being
      used as a field computer to gather data from the eco-garden that we are trying to
      build.  The other laptop could be used as a mobile training computer, used to
      train both dian and lentara staff in new methodology.  Truly, the opportunities
      in education would be endless.</i>
