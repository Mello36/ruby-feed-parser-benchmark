It allowed me to reflect on my own experiences in context to better understand why certain companies successfully made the transition while others stalled or atrophied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the book is the culmination of research conducted by McFarland and his associates of more than 7,000 of America's fastest growing private and public companies. It succinctly describes the characteristics of mid-sized entrepreneurial companies that break through to become, "significant, lasting, and difference-making organizations." It also rightfully cautions, "that there are no permanent breakthrough companies - only companies that engage in practices leading to long-term success. And just as it's possible for an everyday company to achieve breakthrough performance, it's equally possible for a breakthrough company to, without realizing it, fall back into life as an everyday firm." To that, from my own experiences, I agree with McFarland's summarizing premise that, "breakthrough is a journey, not a destination."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is filled with valuable tidbits that will have you rethinking everything from how to craft and manage your corporate strategy to how to recruit and motivate employees. However, one takeaway that really resonated with me came from the responses to McFarland's question at the end of each interview:&amp;nbsp; "As you look to the future, what worries you?"&amp;nbsp; According to McFarland, nine times out of ten the response went something like this: "The greatest challenge will be to maintain and nurture those organizational qualities that have allowed our company to succeed in the first place." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're an entrepreneur struggling to understand why the light at the end of the tunnel never seems glow any brighter, then read this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those that have read, "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996/?tag=satisfactiong160-20&amp;amp;gclid=CKP00byXjpYCFQZlswodBh4mFw"&gt;Good to Great&lt;/a&gt;," by &lt;a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/"&gt;Jim Collins&lt;/a&gt;, think of, "The Breakthrough Company," as "Good to Great" for small to mid-sized businesses. If you haven't read "Good to Great" then read "The Breakthrough Company" first. It delivers an excellent foundation to better appreciate how companies break through and ultimately become great.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:5e68d6fd-3709-4364-9bc9-4e7d3c265951" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/The%20Breakthrough%20Company" rel="tag"&gt;The Breakthrough Company&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Keith%20McFarland" rel="tag"&gt;Keith McFarland&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Good%20to%20Great" rel="tag"&gt;Good to Great&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Jim%20Collins" rel="tag"&gt;Jim Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/10/book-review-breakthrough-company-how.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-7964201576976066494</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2008 12:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-10-02T14:33:24.364-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>differentiation</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><title>Strategy - Why Companies of Every Size Should Blog</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm amazed at how often I come across companies, both large and small, that don't have a corporate blog. You would think that, by now, every company would be on the blog bandwagon, but that's not the case. For those on the fence about starting a blog think of it like this: If the playing field between you and your competitors is level, having a corporate blog will more than likely give you the edge to win more business. It's that simple. This is especially true during tough economic times as blogs carry next to no cost other than the time it takes to keep them current.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are countless reasons why blogs are a necessary component of any business, but here are some of the more popular reasons:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. They keep your customer's engaged and humanize your company&lt;/strong&gt;. This can't be stressed strongly enough. Having regular blog posts puts a face on your company that people appreciate in a socio-economic environment seemingly devoid of direct interaction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. They make you appear contemporary and relevant&lt;/strong&gt;. This is especially true when the topics of your blog discuss current issues of the industry or market that you serve.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. They enable instant feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. The comment function of blogs allow customers to give you immediate feedback on business and industry topics. The feedback allows you to refine your message, goods and services. It also enables you to get your hands around a potential issue early.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. They help give you visibility and enable potential customers to more readily find you&lt;/strong&gt;. Search engine crawlers are always looking for new content. Having regular blog posts results in your material getting indexed more often, taking you higher in organic search results, making it easier for potential customers to find you.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. They are a great networking tool&lt;/strong&gt;. Virtually every business has or needs a network that need to be kept aware of what's going on in your industry and your company. Blogs allow you to regularly reach hundreds -- if not thousands -- of existing and potential customers without regard for time and geographical differences. Used as a networking tool blogs are a great time saver when reaching out to your network.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. They offer a virtually free way of getting your message out and creating buzz about your company&lt;/strong&gt;. I realize I mentioned this earlier, but it's worth repeating. We all know that times are tough right now. Marketing budgets are getting slashed left and right. Blogging can create demand for your goods or services, keep your pipeline of prospective customers warm, and position you as a thought leader in your industry. That's an extraordinary amount of value for something that's all but free to get up and running.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that you're committed to getting a corporate blog up and running, what follows are some blogging mistakes to avoid from Christopher Barger, manager of &lt;a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/"&gt;GM's FastLane&lt;/a&gt;, considered one of the more successful corporate blogs. He recently provided &lt;a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/#"&gt;MarketingSherpa&lt;/a&gt; with ten common blogging mistakes and how to avoid them. They are as follows:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #1. Treating the blog like a channel for corporate messaging&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barger says that the greatest value of a blog is in the dialogue with readers. Successful blog posts generate reader comments. And readers generally don't respond well to corporate messaging.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If all you're doing is restating a press release in first person or giving them news they can already get somewhere else, you've given them nothing," Barger says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FastLane has fought becoming a channel for routine corporate messaging throughout its three-year existence. The blog became a victim of its own success, says Barger. It's popularity had people thinking of it as another place for corporate communication instead of for meaningful dialogue with readers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Encourage posts that don't resemble press releases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Pay attention to the comments readers post. If you see a recurring topic, find an expert within the company to address it in a blog post.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-If you want to blog about a new product, have the engineer or someone who has used the product write about it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #2. Rushing to respond to negative feedback&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When responding to reader comments, sooner is not always better. No matter how direct or honest your intentions are for a corporate blog, there will always be readers who don't want to hear what you have to say. Some people will read a blog just to poke holes through everything you say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be patient. Be prudent. Hold off responding to a negative comment for a few hours – other readers might correct the original post for you. The audience tends to police itself, says Barger. "They will see people who are reflexively critical or dismissive and they'll dismiss them right back," he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #3. Fearing the critics&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't fear constructive criticism. Your audience will respect that, and you should, too. "For anyone afraid of starting a blog for fear they're giving their critics a place to go after them, I would argue that does happen, but you have to give your audience credit for being smarter than that," says Barger.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respond to them if need be by keeping in mind that negative comments bring a positive aspect along with them – they allow you to become aware of your audience's opinions. Those same comments could be happening at happy hour or at dinner tables instead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #4. Ghostwriting blog posts&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barger's team does not ghostwrite posts for employees or executives at GM. The blog could lose its transparency – one of those trust-building, relationship-building elements.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a byline on each post. Each FastLane post has a byline and the title of the person who wrote it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're trying to personify or humanize the organization, having a byline helps contribute to that," Barger says. It helps readers understand that each writer has a different perspective and personality. It enables them to address the writer on a more personal level.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #5. Giving blog writers the impression that once a post is written, it's done&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding blog writers is a challenge in itself, Barger says. So, it's important to tell them up front what the task requires. The best bloggers read and respond to comments. They start to adapt readers' perspectives for future posts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it clear to blog writers that filing a post is not the end of the road. They may have to respond to comments.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #6. Relying on writers who are too corporate&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, the higher up the chain of command, the more corporate people tend to sound. They can't help it, Barger says. Their writing voice sounds like it would on television. It's formal. "That's not what this medium is for," he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FastLane engages mostly mid-level salaried employees or execs at the vice president or director level to write blog posts. (Note: GM's Vice Chairman Bob Lutz is an exception. Lutz is known for his "straight talk" and personal tone, which is perfect for the blog.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #7. Not establishing blog rules&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every corporate blog should have some basic rules of conduct: Acceptable topics, taboos, etc. Tell the bloggers beforehand what the rules so everyone can follow them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blog rules can be summed up in three words: "Don't be stupid," says Barger. To clarify, don't write anything you wouldn't write in an email to someone outside the company.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, you have to decide whether you trust your employees, and I would argue if you don't, you have much bigger problems than just the existence of a blog," he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #8. Posting infrequently&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting frequently is a basic rule of blogging. How often to post is determined by the company. But rule of thumb: Not less than twice per week. This is particularly challenging for corporate blogs because it's often difficult to get people to commit to blog posting on a regular basis, Barger says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequence of not posting regularly is loss of readership; people will stop checking the blog if they don't see new posts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to get at least eight people within your company to commit to blogging. If each person posts once per month, that equals two posts per week if you give them deadlines on specific days.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #9. Going against your comment policy&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a blog policy for writers, every corporate blog needs a comment policy for readers. This policy protects the company's credibility should it choose not to approve a comment for a reason stated in the guideline. The important thing is not to violate your own policy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be consistent with the comment policy. For example, GM tells readers that posts relating to car ownership issues are forwarded to customer service rather than posted on the blog. Inconsistency can ruin a blog's credibility.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #10. Editing, hiding, or taking a post down when you make a mistake&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone will screw up at some point. A writer will post something inaccurate. Links will go unchecked. A reader will take offense. Don't try to hide it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this mistake:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you mess up, say so rather than trying to hide it or edit something out or take it down," says Barger. "People are forgiving of mistakes if you say, 'Well, we screwed up here. Sorry. We'll try to do better next time.'"  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested, &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article in 2005 titled, "&lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/feb2008/db20080219_908252.htm"&gt;Blogs Will Change Your Business&lt;/a&gt;," that is a very worthwhile read. The article was revised and updated in June 2008. The revised article transcends blogs to discuss the growing number of social media tools such as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why wait any longer. Start blogging today. You'll be glad you did. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:659e9a25-a511-49e6-b4e9-09efe438c1f1" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/blogging" rel="tag"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/social%20media" rel="tag"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/fastlane" rel="tag"&gt;fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/10/strategy-why-companies-of-every-size.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-5946034333427811242</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2008 10:43:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-09-10T07:12:33.043-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing myths</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>media relations</category><title>Marketing Myths that can Kill a Business; Myth # 4 - We need a huge media relations event to launch our Company</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myth&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Startups often feel the need to spend big dollars for a magnanimous splash event to rally the industry behind their incarnation of the "next big thing."  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While having a meaningful impact at launch is important, what will impress editors, analysts and pundits even more is demonstrating success over time. Often referred to as "rolling thunder," you are much better off and will have a much higher ROI on your PR spend by regularly pulsing the market with worthwhile announcements than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a launch event.  &lt;p&gt;When you're ready to launch, have a plan in place that stages announcements for the next three, six and twelve months. Make sure that you focus those announcements on those issues that your audience will find relevant such as key customer wins, new strategic partnerships, surpassing meaningful company milestones, etc.  &lt;p&gt;Just so you know, several of today's most talked about companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft did not have a formal launch per se. The media traction for those companies came from staying dogged with PR pursuits over time.  &lt;p&gt;So, before you commit to spending a huge portion of your newly minted investor dollars on a launch event, spend the time to think through how to get the most bang for the buck over the long haul. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:fa005229-8543-4881-b37e-26d86a4a3551" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/media%20relations" rel="tag"&gt;media relations&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20myths" rel="tag"&gt;marketing myths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/09/marketing-myths-that-can-kill-business.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-2193221034726101684</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2008 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-07-20T07:56:44.282-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><title>Strategy - Niche Social Networks</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While perusing the blogosphere a couple of days ago, I came across a specialized social network targeted at book lovers titled, &lt;a href="http://www.shelfari.com/"&gt;Shelfari&lt;/a&gt;. According to Shelfari's website, the company introduces readers to a global community of book lovers and encourage them to share their literary inclinations and passions with peers, friends, and total strangers (for now). As an avid reader, I joined and started adding my literary interests. Although I'm just getting started, I like that I can share my tastes with others and I hope I can glean new books to read based on like-minded individuals.  &lt;p&gt;With general interest social network providers such as &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bebo.com/"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt; addressing the needs of the masses, I believe that niche social networks such as Shelfari and the venture I am currently working at &lt;a href="http://www.teamzonesports.com/"&gt;TeamZoneSports&lt;/a&gt;, a private social network for sports teams, represent the next big wave in social networking.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/"&gt;Business Week&lt;/a&gt; article, "&lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070314_884996.htm?chan=search"&gt;Social Networks Go Niche&lt;/a&gt;," published in March 2007, "...some users and potential users have grown wary about exposing themselves to so many people [using open social networks such as MySpace and Facebooks]. Some users would rather connect with people with whom they share common interests, such as hobbies or professional associations, other than knowing somebody who knows somebody who is listed as a MySpace friend." I place myself firmly in this category. I would much rather connect with those who I have a real association or relationship with as opposed to the randomness inherent with open social networks.  &lt;p&gt;From a monetization perspective, the same article suggests that advertisers are willing to pay a hefty premium to have their ads display on niche social networks over those that target the masses. It reflects that advertisers pay double digit CPMs to display on niched social networks compared to the sub-$1 CPM range of broad-based social networks.  &lt;p&gt;In January 2008, the social networking news source, &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/01/06/advertisers-increasingly-eying-niche-social-networks/"&gt;Mashable&lt;/a&gt;, reflected, "According to eMarketer, last year advertisers spent $920 million on advertising within social networks - and of that amount, 8.2 percent went to niche networks. This year it is estimated that spending will increase to $2.1 billion, and the take for smaller networks will rise to 10%. This is due to what is perceived as an improved return on investment for an advertiser's marketing dollar through secondary social channels." So, both the size of the advertising pie increases as well as the share of the pie for niche social network providers.  &lt;p&gt;All that said, I've added my Shelfari Bookshelf to this blog. You can check it out by scrolling down the page until you see the bookshelf in the sidebar on the left side of the page.

Google Trends gives media planners and buyers historical data for terms used in search. For me, this has already become an invaluable tool as I can better time my sports-centric campaigns and community development efforts around a particular sport based on when consumers are likely to be searching for that sport. Most recently at TeamZoneSports, I noticed the number of people searching for baseball and softball taper off. Google Trends reflected that characteristic as well as enlightened me to the fact that golf traffic peaks over the summer months and that football and soccer traffic start to increase July and sustain heavy search traffic through the fall months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;table style="width: auto"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/GoogleTrends/photo?authkey=ocqsqMVt4Ak#5221327044146912114"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/garyjdavis07/SHXhSGqEW3I/AAAAAAAAAUQ/XpoaTgq6YYU/s400/google_trends.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; text-align: right"&gt;From &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/GoogleTrends?authkey=ocqsqMVt4Ak"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago Google announced Google Ad Planner. According to Google, Google Ad Planner, "is a free media planning tool that can help you identify websites your audience is likely to visit so you can make better-informed advertising decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Google Ad Planner, you can:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Define audiences by demographics and interests.  &lt;li&gt;Search for websites relevant to your audience.  &lt;li&gt;Access aggregated statistics on the number of unique visitors, page views, and other data for millions of websites from over 40 countries.  &lt;li&gt;Create lists of websites where you'd like to advertise and store them in a media plan.&amp;nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Generate aggregated website statistics for your media plan." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've only just started to use Google Ad Planner as access is permitted only via invitation from Google. What I've seen so far shows great potential. Using the sports example reflected earlier, starting with baseball at &lt;a href="http://www.mlb.com/"&gt;mlb.com&lt;/a&gt; you are able to quickly drill down to see associated sites along with site traffic, demographics, sample search terms that would land you there, etc. then create a media plan that targets those sites that your prospects are most likely to visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For budget conscience marketing organizations, Google has assembled a suite of services that should be seriously considered. When you consolidate the functionality of Google Trends and Google Ad Planner with &lt;a href="https://adwords.google.com"&gt;Google Adwords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, you are able to enjoy a comprehensive, rich media planning, implementation and analysis portfolio unrivaled in the market today. Granted there are point products/services available from other providers that offer deeper functionality, but when you consider the cost to use Google's media tools (i.e., free), that they tend to be easy to use, and are available from a single provider, you will be hard-pressed to find something elsewhere with the same value-added capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm anxious to see what new products or services Google delivers as they fuse recently-acquired Double-Click capabilities and other innovations into their total media offering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since timing and location of ads are critical dimensions to a successful marketing campaign, these two new services from Google add great value for taking on-line decisions. With them, Google continues to cement my confidence as my on-line end-to-end media partner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:8440f4c3-f95b-4181-9230-bfd781a0db0d" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/google%20ad%20planner" rel="tag"&gt;google ad planner&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/google%20trends" rel="tag"&gt;google trends&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/google%20analytics" rel="tag"&gt;google analytics&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/google%20adwords" rel="tag"&gt;google adwords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/07/advertising-two-great-new-tools-for.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://lh6.ggpht.com/garyjdavis07/SHXhSGqEW3I/AAAAAAAAAUQ/XpoaTgq6YYU/s72-c/google_trends.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-4012435253721691443</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2008 20:54:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-07-22T15:58:14.629-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>go to market</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Go To Market - The GA Checklist</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I read an interesting article in &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; by Made to Stick co-authors Dan and Chip Heath titled, "&lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/123/heroic-checklist.html"&gt;The Heroic Checklist&lt;/a&gt;." The gist of the article is that, although considered mundane, having a checklist can ensure essential tasks are properly completed in repeatable processes. The anchor anecdote from the article reflects how hospitals in Michigan use a checklist to make certain that intensive-care units adhere to a five-step checklist when inserting intravenous lines into patients. Implementing the checklist has saved Michigan hospitals an estimated $175 Million in complications associated with infections from improperly inserted lines and is credited with saving over 1,500 lives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've always been a big believer in using checklists to facilitate the completion of repetitive tasks as well as make certain that task participants and key stakeholders understand what's required of them and when. One checklist in particular that comes to mind that I used extensively while CMO of CommerceQuest is the GA Checklist. For those unfamiliar with the acronym "GA," it stands for Generally Available and describes a software product that is ready for market.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My multi-page GA Checklist covered every go-to-market requirement from pricing/packaging/promotion to media/analyst relations and sales training. It was a great tool as we regularly released new products as well as major revisions to existing products. At any given time, I estimate we were preparing 2-3 products for market, making the GA Checklist an invaluable tool. You can check out the GA Checklist by clicking on the following: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;table style="width: auto"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/GAChecklist/photo?authkey=cs7eXo-VaK8#5214407541969571074"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/garyjdavis07/SF1MCEU2zQI/AAAAAAAAASw/NF0O8Sf_fm4/s400/GA%20Checklist_0001.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; text-align: right"&gt;From &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/GAChecklist?authkey=cs7eXo-VaK8"&gt;GA Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that checklists need to evolve. Although my GA Checklist worked well during my tenure at CommerceQuest, it would have to be updated to meet contemporary go-to-market requirements such as digital distribution, social media outreach, and several other current marketing facets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granted, my GA checklist was not going to save lives, but it did ensure that all our bases were covered as products were readied for market. It also allowed me to get in front of potential issues before they could derail an otherwise effective go-to-market campaign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an environment where we are called on to do more with less in constantly compressed time frames, creating checklists will ensure the highest likelihood of the desired outcome. So, although you may hear some grumbling from employees when you task them with following a well thought-out checklist, stand your ground. Doing so will ensure you avoid blind spots and increase the likelihood of a successful outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:9cfb305c-b527-4e03-b7c7-2548d98198be" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/go%20to%20market" rel="tag"&gt;go to market&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/checklist" rel="tag"&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing" rel="tag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/06/go-to-market-ga-checklist.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://lh4.ggpht.com/garyjdavis07/SF1MCEU2zQI/AAAAAAAAASw/NF0O8Sf_fm4/s72-c/GA%20Checklist_0001.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-2908827486807909537</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-04-21T20:00:53.707-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>differentiation</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>book review</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Book Review - The Riddle: Where Ideas Come From and How to Have Better Ones</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BookReviewTheRiddle02/photo?authkey=U0zzbgCFVck#5191840658753052546"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/garyjdavis07/SA0fklNn34I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/F24PEArOVoc/s144/book_riddle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I think of innovation, companies from the information age such as &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ideo.com/"&gt;IDEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.alibaba.com/"&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt; come to mind. These companies regularly push the innovation envelope with great success. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How these companies innovate seems to be quite different. For example, as an outsider looking in, it appears that Apple is very structured and methodical in how it approaches innovation; always adhering to its core vision of delivering products that are useful, affordable and easy-to-use. It's almost as if you can envision Steve Jobs pontificating and driving innovation throughout the hallowed halls of Apple. Contrast that with Google where they appear to approach innovation as a random, ad hoc activity hoping that, among other activities, the 20% "personal time" all Google employees enjoy will result in innovations that the company will benefit from. Needless to say, both approaches have resulted in countless WOW products that left potential competitors dumbfounded and contemplating, "Why didn't we think of that?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As successful as these companies have been in getting new ideas to market, there have been instances where each company has come up short on the innovation front. For example, when Google struck its mega-deal to advertise on MySpace, the company would have been wise to embrace the "five whys" from Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota and considered the father of the Japanese industrial revolution. The first "why" should have been: "Why do people spend time on a social network?" Going through this process, the company would have quickly realized that people active in an online community are very different from those doing search. Armed with this knowledge, I believe Google would have implemented an ad strategy with a delivery and presentation method that aligned better to how users engage social networks. For Apple, you only have to conjure up thoughts of the failed PDA, Newton, when considering innovations gone awry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the other end of the innovation spectrum, companies such as AOL, CA and BMC Software come to mind in that they have seemingly lost the ability to innovate organically. Innovations from these companies tend to come in the form of an acquisition or some other external activity. I'm not sure what causes this. My guess is that they simply don't foster an innovation-centric culture, or it could be that the leaders of these companies are unable to look past the next fiscal quarter as part of their decision making process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of where your company sits along the innovation continuum, &lt;a href="http://www.andrewrazeghi.com./riddle.html"&gt;The Riddle: Where Ideas Come From and How to Have Better Ones&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.andrewrazeghi.com./index.asp"&gt;Andrew Razeghi&lt;/a&gt; is a worthwhile read. The book uses real-world examples to demystify how innovation takes place and serves up a blueprint for creating and processing ideas. It also identifies five precursors -- curiosity, constraints, connections, conventions, and codes -- needed to create an environment that fosters and supports innovation as essential underpinning for success. Throughout the book, Razeghi enumerates actionable steps that can be implemented to increase any organizations' odds of being more innovative. It's the type of book that you will find yourself going back to regularly to keep your innovation skills honed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For marketers tasked with thinking outside-the-box for the next marketing strategy, campaign, or promotion, Razeghi's book will give you a game plan with practical insights into how ideas are created as well as steps that can be employed to enable you and your team with ideas that are both controllable and repeatable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those interested, another worthwhile read to help stimulate creative thought is &lt;a href="http://www.debonogroup.com/debono.htm"&gt;Edward de Bono's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.debonogroup.com/lateralthinking.htm"&gt;Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:8b3a820b-63b6-4338-acff-881e05fbdd49" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/innovation" rel="tag"&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/creativity" rel="tag"&gt;creativity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/apple" rel="tag"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/google" rel="tag"&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ideo" rel="tag"&gt;ideo&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/alibaba" rel="tag"&gt;alibaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/04/book-review-riddle-where-ideas-come.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://lh3.ggpht.com/garyjdavis07/SA0fklNn34I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/F24PEArOVoc/s72-c/book_riddle.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-4979282569442686133</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2008 21:53:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-04-05T17:53:15.402-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>customer experience</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Management - Don't Wait Nine Months to Get Back to a Customer</title><description>&lt;p&gt;For those who regularly read my blog, you'll love this. Last July I posted an &lt;a href="http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/07/marketing-management-make-your-company.html"&gt;entry about the importance of making your company accessible&lt;/a&gt;. In the posting, I mentioned that the only means of contacting Motorola about a piece of software I was interested in buying and downloading from its website was via an online form.  &lt;p&gt;I reflected that a month after submitting the form I had yet to receive a reply. Well, you'll be happy to know that on March 31 -- &lt;strong&gt;nine months&lt;/strong&gt; after submitting the online form -- I finally received a one line response from Motorola. I kid you not. What's worse was there was no acknowledgement of any delay.  &lt;p&gt;Contrast that experience with one I had recently with another well-known consumer electronics provider, &lt;a href="http://www.bose.com"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt;. I've had a Bose &lt;a href="http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_STATIC_PAGE_EVENT&amp;amp;url=/home_entertainment/sounddock_family/index.jsp&amp;amp;ck=0"&gt;SoundDock&lt;/a&gt; for about three years. I'm thinking about trading in my fourth generation Apple iPod for an iPod Touch. On a Saturday morning I dialed the toll free number that was easy to locate on the company's website. Ryan in Bose's technical support group picked up on the first ring. He explained to me that because Apple now has so many varieties of iPod, Bose has created a universal adapter for its SoundDock so it will work with any type of iPod. He was more than happy to send me the adapter at no charge. Bose has a customer for life. The next time I'm in the need of a quality sound product, you can bet that I will not stray from the Bose brand.  &lt;p&gt;With the cost of acquiring a new customer ranging from &lt;strong&gt;5 to 10&lt;/strong&gt; times what it costs to keep or upsell new products to an existing customer, it's no wonder that &lt;a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=2714"&gt;Motorola is on the ropes and trying, without success, to sell its handset business&lt;/a&gt;. They simply don't get it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; being the importance of getting back to those pesky customer people about an online software product that has zero distribution cost and -- I would guess -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% profit margin. I can't imagine a more dysfunctional organization. Frankly, at this point they would have been better off not getting back to me at all. At least then I would have attributed it to some type of internal glitch.  &lt;p&gt;A relevant footnote worth sharing is that I got rid of the Motorola phone mentioned in my original blog posting almost six months ago. I decided then to go an entirely different direction for my calendar and contact synching needs. Hey Moto, can you here me now?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b1a663eb-9e26-436f-b81f-783446ef2543" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/motorola" rel="tag"&gt;motorola&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/bose" rel="tag"&gt;bose&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/customer%20service" rel="tag"&gt;customer service&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/04/marketing-management-don-wait-nine.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-4113998100692352275</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2008 15:17:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-03-03T10:17:34.508-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><title>Strategy - The Big Winner if Microsoft is Successful at Acquiring Yahoo is Google</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I understand that Google's public face should voice opposition to Microsoft's bid to acquire Yahoo. But I wouldn't be surprised if Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page are high-fiving one another behind closed doors and hoping that the deal happens. I can think of countless reasons why, but two that are blindingly apparent are the resulting culture clash and leveraged innovation quotient, both of which would enable Google to capitalize on the MS/Yahoo marriage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, if Microsoft is successful at acquiring Yahoo they will have a culture clash of biblical proportion. These companies are at opposite ends of the spectrum on virtually everything from how they innovate to how they make money. It will take years for the two behemoths to effectively integrate -- if full integration is even possible. The clash of cultures would allow Google to cherry-pick top talent from both companies as frustration will rule the day. According to &lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9881216-7.html"&gt;CNET News&lt;/a&gt;, Yahoo has been, "bogged down by ineffective group decision-making and a damaging aversion to taking risks" and is now saying that the acquisition bid is disrupting the company even more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best things that Google has going is its extraordinary ability to innovate. So, while Microsoft and Yahoo are trying to sort out how to play well together in the sandbox, Google can flex and focus its innovation muscle to further distance themselves from the rest of the pack. To that, they should determine what attributes make Yahoo, and for that matter Microsoft, compelling and innovate beyond what both companies offer. For example, I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo Sports&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/122/yahoos-rally-cry.html"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, Yahoo Sports has usurped ESPN.com as the go to destination for sports enthusiasts by cultivating 24.1 million unique visitors compared to ESPN.com's 22.2 million in November of 2007. With online ad revenue for sports growing from $548 million to $1.1 billion by 2011 (according to eMarketer), Google could direct innovation and business resources to become a major player in this burgeoning space. They could also develop Google-based approaches toward other business domains such as finance, travel and music to quickly accelerate past the newly merged entity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's not to say that Google is not without its own challenges. With eMarketer reporting that paid search is starting to slow as a component of total online advertising in the US, Google needs to think outside-the-box to sustain double-digit growth by embracing a variety of online formats. Recently striking a deal with &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/agency/e3i4231af81ca730dd7528a98a585176a6d"&gt;YuMe&lt;/a&gt; is a good beginning, albeit a baby step; since rich media/video is the highest growth sector for online advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a marketing perspective, Google has been enormously successful using word-of-mouth as its primary means of marketing. However, to fend off a merged MS/Yahoo entity will require that the company rethink how to effectively promote themselves via integrated strategies that cross multiple medias with a consistent and compelling message. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All things considered, if Google stays the innovation course while thinking beyond-the-box for new ways to market and monetize itself in ways other than its dependence on paid search advertising, it could create an insurmountable gap that a merged MS/Yahoo might never close.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b694b397-3a91-440e-bff0-7f00f3fbddb7" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Google" rel="tag"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Microsoft" rel="tag"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Yahoo" rel="tag"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/03/strategy-big-winner-if-microsoft-is.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-5451109224599133087</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2008 13:56:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-02-08T08:56:30.715-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing - Targeting Influentials vs. The Masses</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I read an interesting article in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Clive Thompson titled, "&lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/122/is-the-tipping-point-toast.html?page=0%2C0"&gt;Is The Tipping Point Toast?&lt;/a&gt;" The article discusses studies conducted by Duncan Watts that basically dispel the premise of Malcolm Gladwell's best-seller, &lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/"&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/a&gt;, to the point where he suggests that marketers spending north of one billion dollars per year to target Influentials are all but wasting their money. In essence, Watts's research showed little to no correlation between Influentials and burgeoning trends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those who have not read, The Tipping Point, at a high level it runs along the lines of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect"&gt;butterfly effect&lt;/a&gt; in that a butterfly's flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. In Gladwell's case, small numbers of people --Influentials -- who start behaving differently can ultimately ripple outward until critical mass or the "tipping point" is reached. For example, Gladwell reflects how some hip Influentials brought Hush Puppies from the brink of bankruptcy by wearing Hush Puppy shoes in the fashion sensitive Village district in SoHo, New York City. They made Hush Puppies cool and relevant which caught on like wildfire through word-of-mouth to spawn a rebirth of the languishing brand. Within two years, Hush Puppies went from being all but dead to growing a remarkable 5000% without spending anything on advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gladwell's thesis is that ideas, products, messages, behaviors, etc. gain momentum and ultimately "tip" largely by the actions of three pivotal types of Influentials: &lt;br&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Connectors&lt;/em&gt; - people who know lots of people and can link those people together &lt;br&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Mavens&lt;/em&gt; - people who accumulate and pass along knowledge&lt;br&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Salesmen&lt;/em&gt; - people proficient at the art of persuasion  &lt;p&gt;Watts contends that it takes more then just highly social individuals to "tip" a product or service. His "tipping point" counter is that unless society is ready for change, no amount of encouragement from Influentials will cause something to tip. In fact, he suggests that the greatest way to effect a trend is through good, old-fashioned mass marketing. The article states, "He [Watts] has analyzed email patterns and found that highly connected people are not, in fact, crucial social hubs. He has written computer models of rumor spreading and found that your average slob is just as likely as a well-connected person to start a huge new trend. And last year, Watts demonstrated that even the breakout success of a hot new pop band might be nearly random. Any attempt to engineer success through Influentials, he argues, is almost certainly doomed to failure."  &lt;p&gt;Watts's perspective is encapsulated in the following illustration from the magazine article.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;table style="width: auto"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/TargetingInfluentialsVsTheMasses/photo?authkey=5P-aehKp51s#5164585028734486658"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.google.com/garyjdavis07/R6xKuHIFCII/AAAAAAAAAOI/jh2xLAQirS4/s400/Gary%27s%20article0002.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; text-align: right"&gt;From &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/TargetingInfluentialsVsTheMasses?authkey=5P-aehKp51s"&gt;Targeting Inf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way I see it is I don't believe Gladwell said that you should abandon your marketing strategies and campaigns by putting all of your eggs in the Influential's basket. What he does do is enlighten marketers to explore and leverage Influentials as a facet of any integrated marketing strategy. Targeting Influentials is particularly relevant as Web 2.0 continues to gain momentum. Those who used to be able to influence only a few are now able to quickly impact thousands, if not millions, of prospective consumers via blogs, customer reviews, social networks, etc.  &lt;p&gt;Any good marketing program needs to strike a balance across the spectrum of available options. The use of Influentials is just one of many options that should be considered. What's key is understanding the ebbs and tides of your prospective customers and market dynamics then applying those techniques that will drive adoption to the point of "tipping." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:a4573dc6-cfa5-4ead-96de-2fa28d7c1493" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Tipping%20Point" rel="tag"&gt;Tipping Point&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Fast%20Company" rel="tag"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Marketing%20Strategy" rel="tag"&gt;Marketing Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/02/marketing-targeting-influentials-vs.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-3049466284663083627</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2008 18:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-19T15:04:04.254-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>advertising</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><title>Advertising - The Next Big Thing in Online Advertising</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I read a post in the &lt;a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/"&gt;Long Tail&lt;/a&gt; blog titled, &lt;a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/01/what-does-the-m.html"&gt;"What does the 'Media Business Model' mean?"&lt;/a&gt; that outlines the different ways online media companies generate revenue. Although it appears to be a work in progress post, one omission is "Time on Site" as an emerging media business model. Because everyone in the media biz loves acronyms, let's refer to "Time on Site" as TOS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TOS advertising got a big boost this past summer when Nielsen//NetRatings announced they are replacing page views with time on site as the primary Web traffic metric. With the widespread adoption of AJAX-based sites and online video, page views as a metric are becoming increasingly less relevant.  In &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/surprise_msn_video.php"&gt;Surprise: MSN Has Built the Video Site of the Future&lt;/a&gt;, the author, Marshall Kirkpatrick, suggests, "While other sites (like YouTube and MySpace) keep pumping out the page views and trying to figure out how to best run ads - this new &lt;a href="http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-us"&gt;MSN Video&lt;/a&gt; site has hit on a formula that will likely represent the video portal of the future: AJAX powered video play lists, including recommended videos, that do not require new page loads and are monetized by time-based advertising. You could spend hours watching a play list of videos from a variety of sources on MSN Video without ever loading a new page." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://www.myteamzone.com/Index.aspx"&gt;MyTeamZone&lt;/a&gt;, we consider TOS as a key metric to our revenue model. We anticipate using several techniques to leverage TOS as a source of revenue. For example, we plan to use product placement in video training content. We believe that advertisers will find it valuable because their products will be prominently yet discreetly placed in front of a captive audience for extended periods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can see this for yourself in the video below. It not only serves up great baseball training, but you are viewing the &lt;a href="http://www.underarmour.com/"&gt;Under Armour&lt;/a&gt; brand for the entire segment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/f5aAbzGs8SM&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine the video above framed by a discreet border from retailers like The Sports Authority or Dick's Sporting Goods that links the user directly to a landing page with baseball gear from Under Armour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For MyTeamZone, we chose &lt;a href="http://silverlight.net/"&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft to render photos and videos. Not only does it offer the highest possible quality viewing experience, but is also gives us several ways to selectively place and manage ads in our video and photo content.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A great case study that demonstrates how product placement was used in online video and tied directly to revenue can be found in the Business 2.0 article titled, "&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/03/01/8401044/index.htm"&gt;Make Way for Must Stream TV&lt;/a&gt;." The article discusses how one of the co-hosts of Revision3's Diggnation was suffering from a bad cold so he drank a cup of Adagio tea instead of a bottle of beer - his normal refreshment for the show. After the show Revision3 struck a deal with the tea manufacturer for a quid pro quo arrangement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The article states, "The terms: Adagio would put together a special $20 Diggnation 'sampler set' (a teapot, four teas, and a tea guide) to plug during the next show; Revision3 would get a 20 percent cut of any resulting sales. Rose (one of the co-hosts) chose his favorites and mentioned a special URL where viewers could purchase the tea online. A month after the show posted to iTunes, Adagio had rung up &lt;strong&gt;$100,000 in Diggnation-linked sales - a 25 percent boost&lt;/strong&gt; to its average monthly tally."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies that have made a living off page views are upbraiding Neilsen's decision, but I believe they made the right move in light of where the space is moving. Like most shifts, the  mechanics for TOS advertising still need to be vetted. It's simply a matter of time before publishers and advertisers sort out the basis for charging for time on site.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:36bf58b6-94c3-4d0a-b72d-931b5356055c" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline; float: none;"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/time%20on%20site" rel="tag"&gt;time on site&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/msn%20video" rel="tag"&gt;msn video&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/online%20adversiting" rel="tag"&gt;online adversiting&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/silverlight" rel="tag"&gt;silverlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/01/advertising-next-big-thing-in-online.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-1250305164953082921</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2008 20:12:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-12T15:12:29.457-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>measurement</category><title>My How Things Have Changed</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I read a Google blog post by Bo Cowgill titled, &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/flow-of-information-at-googleplex.html"&gt;The Flow of Information at Googleplex&lt;/a&gt;. It discusses Google's use of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market"&gt;predictive markets&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how organizations process information and respond to external events. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took me back to what feels like eons ago when I was pursuing my Masters degree in Public Administration from the University of Oklahoma. My concentration was quantitative methods and analysis. Along my concentration, I decided on a thesis that consisted of conducting a non-equivalent, control group comparison study. The study examined the impact of implementing a multi-threaded, integrated voter registration awareness campaign at Naval Air Station, Barbers Point, Hawaii compared to another nearby military installation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time of my thesis, I used first-generation software from &lt;a href="http://www.spss.com/"&gt;SPSS&lt;/a&gt; to correlate and analyze the data I collected. It's amazing to me how much more difficult and rudimentary it was then when I consider what's available today to conduct similar types of studies.&amp;nbsp; Seeing the findings from the Google study demonstrate significant advances as evidenced with something as simple as overlaying a &lt;a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Ap14FtNN91w/R4LNLk1LpGI/AAAAAAAAAtY/tqybRVMRHbw/s1600-h/Prophit_heatmap.JPG"&gt;heat map distribution&lt;/a&gt; over a Googleplex office to see areas where employees made profitable decisions (green) and areas where employees made unprofitable decisions (red) when trading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when I was doing my thesis, I knew that technology would have a massive impact on how we conduct and analyze &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"&gt;socioeconomic&lt;/a&gt; studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing how far things have progressed, I'm anxious to see what lies ahead as technology evolves in areas like &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535836,00.html"&gt;neuromarketing&lt;/a&gt; and mobility-centric &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics"&gt;predictive analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:562b25d6-cac0-4c3e-ac0e-4069f130c5cf" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/market%20analysis" rel="tag"&gt;market analysis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/socioeconomics" rel="tag"&gt;socioeconomics&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Google" rel="tag"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/predictive%20markets" rel="tag"&gt;predictive markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/01/my-how-things-have-changed.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-1218672778446788328</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 20:44:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-01T15:44:49.255-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Management - Startups 2.0</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I read a great article in &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Tynan titled, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/12/monetize"&gt;VCs Tell Startups: Don't Show Me the Money (Yet)&lt;/a&gt;. The article resonated with me as I've experienced first-hand how dramatically different the startup environment is now compared to during the bubble from both a cost to deploy and time to revenue perspective.  &lt;p&gt;For example, while CMO at CommerceQuest, which was acquired by &lt;a href="http://www.metastorm.com/"&gt;Metastorm&lt;/a&gt;, we built an innovative managed service called &lt;a href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2206782/CommerceQuest-Rated-One-of-the.html"&gt;enableNet&lt;/a&gt;. Built during the bubble apex, enableNet provided any-to-any integration over the Internet. It realized significant market traction with the then in vogue Net Market Makers as they all needed some level of integration and connectivity to realize their business objectives.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p&gt;We built enableNet to run on IBM mainframes in order to get 99.99999 percent uptime. We housed our mainframes in the newest Internet data centers with the fattest possible pipes. It literally took an army of technicians, developers, system operators, etc. to build, monitor and maintain the system. To top it all off, we were headquartered on the top floor of the newest building in Tampa.  &lt;p&gt;Like a lot of companies during the bubble, we took on significant venture capital to fuel adoption and growth both of which came at breakneck speed. It needed to because the cost to build, deploy and support enableNet required that we monetize it soonest.  &lt;p&gt;Contrast enableNet with &lt;a href="http://www.myteamzone.com/Index.aspx"&gt;MyTeamZone&lt;/a&gt; -- a new Web 2.0 venture I'm currently working on. MyTeamZone is a private community where sports teams can easily share information, communicate and coordinate activities.  &lt;p&gt;For hardware, we use off-the-shelf, rack mounted, 1U Dell servers running Windows server operating system. Using the .NET framework, a good portion of our application logic comes from third party controls and libraries that are either open source or are very inexpensive to license. We've even outsourced some of our development to an offshore team.&amp;nbsp; For deployment, we currently co-lease a rack in an Internet data center. We use &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; to monitor traffic and usage patterns. Finally, we are operating out of a very modest office with a hodgepodge of furnishings.  &lt;p&gt;I'm not at liberty to disclose how much was spent on enableNet or MyTeamZone. However, I can say that from a development and infrastructure perspective enableNet was over 20 times more expensive to build, deploy, maintain and market than what we are experiencing with MyTeamZone.  &lt;p&gt;Now, looking at the differences of the bubble period versus today from a marketing perspective, I managed multi-million dollar budgets while at CommerceQuest. A large portion of those budgets was directed towards SEO and SEM, which, for the most part, were provided by outside agencies. It often took months at a significant cost to promote our products to the first page of the various search engines.  &lt;p&gt;At MyTeamZone, in less than two weeks and using a couple of hours of an internal resource, we are currently on the first page of Google's organic results in position six out of 22+ million results for our key search term -- free team websites.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/MarketingManagementStartups20/photo?authkey=ZGz7yqOpb_w#5150557256733498162"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.google.com/garyjdavis07/R3p0iULpGzI/AAAAAAAAANM/yHFvE40gCVY/s400/free_team_websites.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Granted at CommerceQuest we had more products that needed to be optimized across the search engines using a variety of terms, it still demonstrates just how dramatically things have changed as Web 2.0 and the new way of getting started gain momentum.  &lt;p&gt;Because we've been able to get MyTeamZone to market at a fraction of the cost of enableNet, we can stay laser focused on creating a great user experience. We know we will be able to monetize the business if we create user experience that is sticky and allows for viral growth.&amp;nbsp; To that end, we spend a considerable amount of time understanding existing and emerging ways to monetize the business so that once we realize critical mass, we'll be able to capitalize on it. We've looked at traditional Web methods like CPC and CPM advertising as well as more obscure methods such as product placement in our professional online training videos as potential sources of revenue.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it was during the bubble, certain attributes like agility and perseverance makes working at a startup exciting. To be successful still requires passion, commitment, courage, sacrifice and, quite frankly, a whole lot of luck.&amp;nbsp; However, the means of getting your product or service to market has been dramatically compressed on both a cost and time basis. Be mindful of this as you consider your next venture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:943f07bc-d35d-42ea-993d-941b41fa28b8" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/startups" rel="tag"&gt;startups&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/web%202.0" rel="tag"&gt;web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2008/01/marketing-management-startups-20.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-1137812654469925396</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2007 16:38:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-12-29T13:49:46.314-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>book review</category><title>Book Review - Founders At Work: Stories of Startup's Early Days</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/NewAlbum1229071040AM/photo?authkey=VvsolUIb4Us#5149423565755980562"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.google.com/garyjdavis07/R3Ztc0LpGxI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/cglsDjB6UlU/s144/founders_at_work.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent a considerable portion of my career in startup and early stage companies, I'm often told, "You should write a book about what you've experienced and learned." I may do that at some point, but until then I encourage you to read, &lt;a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/index.html"&gt;Founders at Work&lt;/a&gt; by Jessica Livingston. It's a series of interviews with founders from several well-known companies, some of which include Adobe, Apple, Flickr, PayPal and Yahoo!.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book provides candid, eye-opening accounts from those who were in the trenches when these industry heavyweights were just cutting their teeth -- trying to figure out how to make an impact and change the world. It's a great read for those with a startup bug or those with an entrepreneurial spirit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One epiphany that becomes apparent when you read the book is that almost always an initial vision or product idea is recast to fit an evolving market paradigm. To that, I think it goes without saying that agility and perseverance are two key -- if not critical -- attributes of any successful startup.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only narrative I would add to the book is that startups are not for the faint of heart.  In a startup environment you will be called upon to push the very limits of what your mind and body can endure. In addition, although you join a startup because of a particular skill or trait, you quickly find out that to succeed means performing a myriad of roles. One minute you're crafting a go-to-market strategy, the next you're hand soldering a 40 lead, quad flat-pack under a stereo-zoom microscope.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recall the first startup I worked at in northern Virginia.  We were on the hook to deliver six prototype, next generation pen-based computers to secure a $4.5M contract with GE Turbine Systems. Everything needed to be done, from debugging the system BIOS and using machine files to hand-mold the plastic housings to creating a User's Guide.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normal day in a startup typically eclipses those of more established companies. However, during the 45 days leading up to this particular deliverable, the core team of eight was working, on average, 18 hours each day including weekends. In fact, I recall working 38 hours non-stop as we honed in on the finish line.  Most nights we slept on our office floors while breakfast, lunch, and dinner were brought in. Every couple of days we would go home long enough to catch a quick nap, shower and shave. It was physically and mentally grueling.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Words can't describe the sensation we all felt when I dispatched one of our system engineers to deliver the six prototypes -- a full day before they were due. Our minds and bodies were literally numb from the relentless days and hours committed to completing this task. However, the exhilaration from having accomplished so much against very heavy odds elevated us to cloud nine. We opened a bottle of champagne at about 4:00 AM. By the time the rest of the employees started to make their way into the office we were well on our way to a drunken bliss. Mission accomplished.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important attribute of startups is that there is no formula or script you can follow that will guarantee success. To be successful requires passion, commitment, courage, sacrifice and, quite frankly, a whole lot of luck. It's a take no prisoners, get it done at any cost environment where you tend to be cash poor and vision rich. The normal rules of business rarely apply. You learn and adapt as you go.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first week we embarked on the Herculean task above fell during the middle of summer. At about 2:00 AM one morning, I looked up from what I was doing to see one of our engineers standing there in his underwear. It was probably north of 90 degrees in our offices. We knew then there was no way we could be successful in those conditions. Since our landlord was unwilling to have the air conditioning remain on after 7:00 PM, we took matters into our own hands. We located the building control room, picked the lock and figured out how to turn the AC on while we worked through the night.  We were careful to go back to the control room every morning at about 5:00 to turn it off.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, what makes startups truly exciting is that words like "can't" and "process" are all but banned from the corporate vernacular. Fueled largely by adrenalin and passion, it's a purpose driven environment where the odds are stacked against you. To survive, you must do everything humanly possible as both an individual contributor as well as part of a team. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:0797da9b-bc7c-407b-91e8-1565b324cfb0" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/founders%20at%20work" rel="tag"&gt;founders at work&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/startups" rel="tag"&gt;startups&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/early%20stage%20companies" rel="tag"&gt;early stage companies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/12/book-review-founders-at-work-stories-of.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-7573834570434432426</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2007 14:18:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-12-28T18:58:23.475-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>customer experience</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>User Experience - Heed The Ten Demandments</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While perusing the Blogosphere to research a recent &lt;a href="http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/12/marketing-management-servicing-markets.html"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt;, I came across &lt;a href="http://www.thetendemandments.com/"&gt;The Ten Demandments&lt;/a&gt; by Kelly Mooney and Laura Bergheim. In essence, the Ten Demandments are common sense dictums to adhere to when engaging existing or potential customers. The irony of the Ten Demandments is that I can't imagine any company saying that they don't subscribe to them. However, I'm amazed at how often we encounter situations where companies don't practice what they preach.  &lt;p&gt;The one thing I would add from a cursory review of the Ten Demandments (reflected below) is I believe they are weighted. For example, if you don't strongly commit to "Earn my trust" (Demandment #1) as an essential operational tenet then the others become mute.&amp;nbsp; As such, certain Demandments carry a heavier weight then others.  &lt;p&gt;From a personal perspective, it's been over eight years since I've set foot in a Kinko's (now FedEx Kinko's).&amp;nbsp; Historically, the reason I embraced their services was because they were open long hours (Demandment #6) and allowed me to engage their services using their equipment (Demandment #4). However, the three to four times I used them they treated me with indifference and demonstrated what can only be described as gross ineptitude.&amp;nbsp; Because they violated Demandments #1 and #3, I will likely never use them again.  &lt;p&gt;A classic skit from &lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/"&gt;Comedy Central's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/chappelles_show/index.jhtml"&gt;Chappelle's Show&lt;/a&gt; succinctly reflects how I believe Kinko's treated me the few times I used their services.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src="http://xml.searchvideo.com/eb/i/1537368786/a/58ef677afb89fc040e3dec6de7dd6c26/p/1" width="425" height="341" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="m=2024239745&amp;amp;type=video"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drum roll please... Mooney and Bergheim's Ten Demandments are:  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earn my trust&lt;/strong&gt;... This is about respect, integrity, advocacy, and quality. Forget all the others if you can't master this one.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspire me&lt;/strong&gt;... Craft meaningful emotional connections with your consumers through immersive experiences, motivating messages and relevant philanthropy. Inspirational brands transcend their own products and services become greater than the sum of their parts.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy&lt;/strong&gt;... Simplicity, speed and usefulness are the keys to consumer ease. Don't confuse complexity with progress. The best things in life are often the easiest.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put me in charge&lt;/strong&gt;... Consumers expect choices and control, particularly from service organizations that can enable self-paced self-service. Put consumers in the driver's seat or they'll peel out of your parking lot without a second thought.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guide me&lt;/strong&gt;... Too much white noise, too little context - that's the problem. So filter the chaos with expert advice, education and information. And stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your consumers as they move through the decision-making process and beyond.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24/7&lt;/strong&gt;... anytime, anywhere access... that's the ticket in this 'round the clock world. 9-5 hours won't cut it for consumers who expect companies to be there for them all the time, no matter the channel.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get to know me&lt;/strong&gt;... You can't win consumer loyalty without understanding what consumers want. Listen, learn and study up on their real lives, don't just dive into the data pool, to get to know your consumers in a whole new light.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceed my expectations&lt;/strong&gt;... Even demanding consumers can be wowed, so woo them by over-delivering through uncommon courtesies, surprising services and go-the-extra-mile efforts that show you really care.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward me&lt;/strong&gt;... Treat your consumers like the VIPs they are to you - acknowledge and build their loyalty by rewarding them with points programs, privileged access or other winning ways.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay with me&lt;/strong&gt;... Relationships are built not in a day, but in a lifetime, so stay with your consumers if you want them to stay with you. Deliver on post-purchase promises, stay in touch in meaningful ways, and evolve your brand to meet your consumers' evolving needs over time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you own all or part of the marketing function, you need to infuse the Ten Demandments into your ongoing marketing efforts. Something as simple as regularly reaching out to your customers with personalized messages using their preferred media and frequency will stand to delight them for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:328083f3-768e-491f-953a-d24ad288c7cb" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ten%20demandments" rel="tag"&gt;ten demandments&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/comedy%20central" rel="tag"&gt;comedy central&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/chappelle's%20show" rel="tag"&gt;chappelle's show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/12/user-experience-heed-ten-demandments_27.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-5490773012964557478</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2007 19:02:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-12-19T11:06:32.535-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Management - Servicing Markets of One</title><description>&lt;div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stand out in an economy where it seems like everything is being commoditized, marketers need to build and deploy strategies  that embrace markets of one. Sometimes referred to as  &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_customization'&gt;mass customization&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_marketing'&gt;one-to-one marketing&lt;/a&gt;, markets of one is the systematic tailoring of messaging as well as products and services to meet the unique needs of individual customers. In the book &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Markets-One-Creating-Customer-Unique-Customization/dp/1578512387'&gt;Markets of One&lt;/a&gt;, editors Jim Gilmore and Joe Pine reflect in the introduction, "It's a paradigm shift away from the one-size-fits-all way managers have thought about markets over the past century -- today, every individual customer is a market of one."  The convergence of several drivers such as mobility, digital distribution, content consolidation and data mining have primed the pump to fully exploit this concept. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;p&gt;I've seen the effects of this play out in a new venture that I am working on called &lt;a href='http://www.myteamzone.com/'&gt;MyTeamZone&lt;/a&gt; -- a private community where teams share all types of information, coordinate activities and easily communicate with one another. Something as simple as sending personalized e-mail invitations to join MyTeamZone that takes invitees to a personalized landing page has resulted in virtually every invitee joining. A sample of a personalized landing page is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosServiceMarketsOfOne/photo#5145333721803070194'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.google.com/garyjdavis07/R2flwkLpGvI/AAAAAAAAAME/w9I15oRpVK0/s400/mtz_invite_landing.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;In addition, every day we consider mechanisms that we can employ to understand the unique needs of  MyTeamZone members  and what we can do to align their user experience with those needs. For example, we are working on technology that steers specific video training content to members based on profile settings, personal interests, past views, etc. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Contrast MyTeamZone   with a  Holiday wishes email I  received from a vendor trying to get my business. Keeping in mind that I've had discussions and exchanged several e-mails with this vendor, without any salutation the e-mail starts, "Thanks for another great year and hopefully this e-mail finds you safe and happy during this holiday season..."   I receive countless solicitations for my business. The odds of me using this vendor are pretty slim if he can't even manage to spend a couple of minutes to personalize a Holiday greeting e-mail.  The way I look at it is if he won't take a couple of minutes now, how can I expect him to give me the proper time and attention when I might need it most? &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Granted the MyTeamZone and vendor Holiday greeting comparison is simplistic. However, I think it speaks volumes to the merits of reaching constituents with personalized information.  &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;A great example of delivering a sophisticated personalized content model is &lt;a href='http://www.pandora.com/'&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; - a website based on the &lt;a href='http://www.pandora.com/corporate/mgp'&gt;Music Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;. From a song title or artist, Pandora  considers some 400 attributes like melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals and lyrics  to build a personalized online radio station   resulting in a unique  music experience. Users provide direct feedback via a thumbs up or down on individual songs, which Pandora takes into account for future selections. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt; Pandora's roughly seven million subscribers are testimony to the value inherent in serving up personalized content as musical tastes represent an intimate expression of who you are. However, one significant challenge that Pandora faces is that they rely largely on musicologists to analyze and categorize the music  used to shape custom radio stations. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;In the not so distant future, I envision Pandora-like functionality aggregated across the spectrum of personal interests and tastes to serve up a plethora of highly personalized content to the device of your choosing.  &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;For those interested, there are several good books that can help you understand, frame and launch strategies that target markets of one, some of which include:&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href='http://longtail.typepad.com/'&gt;The Long Tail  by Chris Anderson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href='http://www.strategichorizons.com/market.html'&gt;Markets of One by  Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href='http://www.strategichorizons.com/expEconomy.html'&gt;The Experience Economy by Joseph Pine II and James H.

In the article, author Rob Walker suggests that, like brand loyalty, brand managers need to   contemplate and understand brand bigotry. He states, "Marketers pay a lot of attention to brand loyalty and cultdom and devotion. But what about its opposite number -- the brands you simply refuse to consider consuming?" &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;I contend that brand bigotry is, in most cases, tied to good, old-fashioned Pavlovian &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov'&gt;Behavior Modification&lt;/a&gt; or  -- by today's vernacular -- user experience.  Although I don't have any empirical data at my fingertips to support my premise, I do have several life experiences that suggest conditioning as the key to my brand bigotry. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;The couple of times that I have purchased Nike sneakers  the heel did not fit right. Each time I ended up abandoning the shoe long before it wore out because of the ill-fitting heel. Contrast that with my experience with athletic footwear from Converse and Adidas. In both cases the footwear fit fine and was a quality product resulting in  favorable brand association. So, when I go out to buy my next pair of sneakers, it's not worth the $100 or so to try Nike again. Yes, I'm a Nike brand bigot. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Contrast that with hockey skates. In the past ten years I have purchased three pairs of CCM hockey skates (one roller and two ice). I am getting ready to buy a new pair for ice hockey. I have no doubt that I will purchase CCM again, because, at $300 a pair, it's too risky to try Bauer/Nike, Mission, or any other skate manufacturer. Yes, I'm a brand bigot of any brand other than CCM. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;For automobiles, I have owned GM cars and rented countless others. With those that I owned and rented, I was amazed at how poor the quality was and how it appeared to me that making the driver comfortable was an afterthought. To that end, I recall a &lt;a href='http://online.wsj.com/public/us'&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt; article back in the late '80s that described in detail how Ford was making great strides on the quality front and Chrysler was taking the lead in innovative design. At the very end of this lengthy article, the author stated something like: "You all must be wondering about GM. Well, GM's motto is no more ugly cars." That about sums up my experience and impression of GM's brand. I've even gotten to the point where I will look for rental agencies that feature non-GM cars. Yes, I'm a GM brand bigot. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. My brand bigotry stems from direct experience (i.e., conditioning) with specific brands. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;p&gt;Like brand loyalty, brand managers need to understand what tools are available to help them measure and grapple with brand bigotry. This is where the community and interactive nature of Web 2.0 can have a huge impact. By employing contemporary mechanisms that reach out to consumers, bigots and loyalists alike, brand managers can formulate strategies that are able to sustain loyalty while converting bigots. For example, if I were to see compelling evidence in blogs from people I trust and have a lot in common with, I'm fairly certain that my bigotry could be swayed.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;p class='tags'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/brand management' rel='tag'&gt;brand management&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/brand bigotry' rel='tag'&gt;brand bigotry&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/fast company' rel='tag'&gt;fast company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/11/brand-management-did-pavlov-break-brand.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-9173913975443726008</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2007 17:46:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-11-21T11:40:21.183-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>promotion</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>advertising</category><title>Promotion - Pioneer Scores an F for Their Latest TV Spot</title><description>&lt;div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'm watching my Cowboy's nail-biting win against the Buffalo Bills with my daughter on &lt;a href='http://sports.espn.go.com/mnf/'&gt;Monday Night  Football&lt;/a&gt; when a commercial starts with what can only be described as a series of mouth/teeth transitions that culminate in a mouth encompassing the iris of an eye. In the final 1-2 seconds of the ad you see the &lt;a href='http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/'&gt;Pioneer&lt;/a&gt; name with a flat-panel television.  I thought to myself, "What an odd ad." My daughter even commented how strange it was. She went as far as asking, without my prompting, if I was going to blog about it. To give you an idea of how removed the brand was from the ad, until I had a chance to research the spot I thought it was a Panasonic ad because all I caught was that it was from a company whose first letter was a P.&lt;/p&gt;                       &lt;p&gt;Here is the ad to give you an idea of what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;         &lt;object width='425' height='355'&gt;           &lt;param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/degojuC_z-w&amp;amp;rel=1'/&gt;           &lt;param name='wmode' value='transparent'/&gt;           &lt;embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/degojuC_z-w&amp;amp;rel=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' wmode='transparent' width='425' height='355'/&gt;         &lt;/object&gt; &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;What is Pioneer thinking? First of all, you would think that ever since the Infinity automobile launch debacle where you never saw the car in the TV ad that agencies/companies would be sure to build a strong link between their product and the audience. Second, I'm sure they spent a mint producing the ad. In addition, the last time I checked on what it cost to run a 30 second national spot on ESPN MNF it was in the $200K neighborhood. With that kind of money at risk, you would think they would have fully vetted the piece before taking it national.  &lt;/p&gt;                       &lt;p&gt;I find it equally ironic that Pioneer, and Panasonic for that matter, compete in a highly commoditized market when it comes to consumer products like televisions and stereos. However, when poking around both websites to see if I could locate the TV ad, I was amazed at how removed both sites were from anything Web 2.0-centric. It's almost like they don't understand the value of directly engaging consumers in a meaningful way or the social aspects inherent in  today's web user. &lt;/p&gt;                       &lt;p&gt;I love great creative as much as anyone, but if Pioneer is striving for brand loyalty  with  consumers they need to ensure that their ads build a strong correlation between the two. They must also fully embrace Web 2.0 as part of their strategic marketing efforts.          &lt;/p&gt;                       &lt;p class='tags'&gt;&lt;a rel='tag' href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Panasonic'&gt;Pioneer, Panasonic&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a rel='tag' href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Monday Night Football'&gt;Monday Night Football&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a rel='tag' href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/ESPN'&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a rel='tag' href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Web 2.0'&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/10/promotion-panasonic-gets-f-for-their.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-1165705025708588505</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2007 11:53:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-10-02T13:13:10.711-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>go to market</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>differentiation</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>customer experience</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>positioning</category><title>User Experience - IBM Misses The Mark With The Launch of Symphony</title><description>&lt;div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a great day. I read in &lt;a href='http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/sep2007/id20070926_263070.htm?chan=rss_topStories_ssi_5'&gt;Business Week&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href='http://www.ibm.com/us/'&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; recently launched &lt;a href='http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.jspa'&gt;Symphony&lt;/a&gt; -- a free, full-featured suite of business software that competes directly with &lt;a href='http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx'&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;To me, this represented an opportunity for IBM to demonstrate that they could deliver a feature-rich product for the desktop that was compelling and leading edge. When I went to the Symphony website, the first words that came to mind were tired and old. It was like being a kid on Christmas morning. You see a huge box with your name on it that could easily house a shiny, new bicycle only to find out after tearing through the wrapping paper that it's full of socks and underwear. A major bummer. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Everything about the Symphony website is absolutely uninspired.  It's boring and devoid of any exciting language or imagery. &lt;/p&gt;                  &lt;p&gt;The screen shots look like something you would expect from the mid-1990s era of software, which is probably where they dug this up.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;table style='width:auto;'&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony/photo?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk#5116143649686398706'&gt;&lt;img height='210' width='288' src='http://lh4.google.com/garyjdavis07/RwAxivttpvI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/7ha-7-Aufdc/s288/ibm_2.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr/&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td style='font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right'&gt;From &lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk'&gt;Blog Photos: ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;           &lt;/table&gt;           &lt;p/&gt;           &lt;p&gt;What's worse, when I tried to launch the tour this is what I got:&lt;/p&gt;           &lt;table style='width:auto;'&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony/photo?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk#5116143653981366018'&gt;&lt;img height='143' width='288' src='http://lh5.google.com/garyjdavis07/RwAxi_ttpwI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/Fnxyol_dAuY/s288/ibm_1.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr/&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td style='font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right'&gt;From &lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk'&gt;Blog Photos: ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;           &lt;/table&gt;           &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;           &lt;p&gt;Contrast that with &lt;a href='http://www.apple.com/iwork/'&gt;Apple's iWorks&lt;/a&gt; website. iWorks is also a direct competitor of Microsoft Office. It delivers an end-to-end WOW experience  that both excites and inspires.  Every facet of the site begs you to learn more. It's rich visuals and dramatic presentation compel and drive the visitor to at  least try the product. The two images that follow are a representative screen shot and sample from the iWorks Keynote tour. I choose Keynote because the Symphony images above came from their Presentations package. Notice the contemporary look and feel as well as the polished finish across the spectrum of the site. &lt;/p&gt;           &lt;table style='width:auto;'&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony/photo?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk#5116143636801496786'&gt;&lt;img height='180' width='288' src='http://lh5.google.com/garyjdavis07/RwAxh_ttptI/AAAAAAAAAJk/1YWjRpWR9yI/s288/iworks_one.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr/&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td style='font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right'&gt;From &lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk'&gt;Blog Photos: ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;           &lt;/table&gt;           &lt;p/&gt;           &lt;table style='width:auto;'&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony/photo?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk#5116143641096464098'&gt;&lt;img height='150' width='288' src='http://lh6.google.com/garyjdavis07/RwAxiPttpuI/AAAAAAAAAJs/f0eT4b1ZfFE/s288/iworks_two.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr/&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;               &lt;td style='font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right'&gt;From &lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/garyjdavis07/BlogPhotosIBMMissesTheMarkWithTheLaunchOfSymphony?authkey=wVZY98kqRNk'&gt;Blog Photos: ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;           &lt;/table&gt;           &lt;p&gt;        &lt;/p&gt;           &lt;p&gt;In addition to great visuals, Apple  uses exciting descriptors like, "Cinema-quality presentations for everyone," to help position it in a user's mind. I'm not sure what "cinema-quality" means, but I want some. &lt;/p&gt;           &lt;p&gt;Here's my point: if IBM wants to put a serious dent or possibly usurp  Office's leadership position, then they need to take a page from the book of Mac. First, make the website visually engaging, cool and functional.  It's essential that, at a minimum, they fully exploit the visual experience. Second, polish the product to fit today's usage paradigm.  To be adopted it needs to be compelling based on current usage expectations. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if IBM's plan is to simply flood the market with a dated software asset that has been collecting dust on the shelf then they should keep doing what they are doing. However, they should not kid themselves  into believing that just because it's free it will realize widespread adoption. It takes more than that. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;For those interested, &lt;a href='http://www.tompeters.com/'&gt;Tom Peters &lt;/a&gt;published a great book in 1994 titled, &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Wow-Tom-Peters/dp/0679755551'&gt;The Pursuit of WOW!&lt;/a&gt; It does  a great job at profiling companies who understand what it takes to deliver the ultimate customer experience. &lt;br/&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p class='tags'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/IBM Symphony' rel='tag'&gt;IBM Symphony&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple iWorks' rel='tag'&gt;Apple iWorks&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Tom Peters' rel='tag'&gt;Tom Peters&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Microsoft Office' rel='tag'&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href='http://www.technorati.com/tag/Go To Market' rel='tag'&gt;Go To Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/09/user-experience-ibm-misses-mark-with.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-9197614740849091867</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2007 23:49:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-08-23T08:56:27.896-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marcom</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Strategy - Fuse online video into your marketing strategy</title><description>&lt;p&gt;With the number of online video viewers in the U.S. growing from around 55M in 2003 to roughly 140M in 2007, it should be painfully apparent that online video has gone mainstream. This should scream at you&amp;nbsp;of the overwhelming need to embrace video as a critical component of your integrated online marketing strategy. Contrary to popular belief, those that watch videos online are not just pubescent males looking for how many ways someone can get hit in the groin. In fact, news is the most-watched video format online. To that end, video viewers are primarily between 25 and 44 years of age -- the proverbial marketing sweet spot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of a company that does an excellent job at leveraging video as part of its holistic marketing effort is &lt;a href="http://payperpost.com/"&gt;PayPerPost&lt;/a&gt;, a startup that remunerates bloggers who create posts of product reviews that advertisers pay for. PayPerPost uses video in virtually every facet of their integrated marcom. They have even gone as far as to create a quasi-reality TV show, &lt;a href="http://rockstartup.com/index.html"&gt;RockStartup&lt;/a&gt;, that provides a day-in-the-life perspective of the company. At the time of this post, their most recent episode is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;embed name="flashObj" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" src="http://services.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f8/1079012494" width="486" height="412" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" swliveconnect="true" seamlesstabbing="false" base="http://admin.brightcove.com" flashvars="videoId=1125950122&amp;amp;playerId=1079012494&amp;amp;viewerSecureGatewayURL=https://services.brightcove.com/services/amfgateway&amp;amp;servicesURL=http://services.brightcove.com/services&amp;amp;cdnURL=http://admin.brightcove.com&amp;amp;domain=embed&amp;amp;autoStart=false&amp;amp;" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/14596.asp"&gt;Five Essential Video Marketing Tips&lt;/a&gt; posted to iMedia Connections, Aimee Irwin does a great job of reflecting what marketing pros need to consider when leveraging online videos. Although primarily focused on online video advertising, her tips provide a good rule of thumb for any company contemplating an online video presence. At a high level, she suggests that you consider the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Keep it short  &lt;li&gt;Measure results  &lt;li&gt;Content is king  &lt;li&gt;Focus on consistency  &lt;li&gt;Leverage a good network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Done properly, online video is an area where you can quickly stand to differentiate your company from a crowded field of competitors. It will personalize your company and message while providing a reason for visitors to come back. Everything from video testimonials of customers to funny clips of the last company golf outing provide great material. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those thinking, "How can I afford to do this?" Don't fret. Developing an online video presence can be very cost effective. All you need is a digital video camera, video editing software like &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/"&gt;Adobe Premiere&lt;/a&gt;, and access to a video hosting provider like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/"&gt;Google Videos&lt;/a&gt;. Every hosting provider offers you the ability to embed your video pretty much wherever you want. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that to make online videos work requires that you regularly add new content. It is naive to think that you can produce and distribute one video clip that will cause your phones to ring off the hook for eternity. Like your website, you need to regularly update and refresh your video content to remain relevant and keep visitors excited about coming back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if you're a brand new start-up or a Fortune 500 company, you need to figure out how to integrate online video into your marketing strategy today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b9b7b054-ed12-4492-911e-9a4a11d2f173" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marcom" rel="tag"&gt;marcom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing" rel="tag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/strategy" rel="tag"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/08/marketing-strategy-fuse-online-video.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-3632350691320629623</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Aug 2007 20:42:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-12-07T11:25:33.548-05:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>branding</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing myths</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Myths That Can Kill a Business; Myth #3 - Any old website will do</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myth #3 - Any old website will do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm amazed at how often companies spend so little effort, thought and energy on what is probably their most important marketing asset - their website. Practically every day I encounter websites that scream, "It doesn't matter what it looks like or says, just get it done."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing I do when I venture across a company is check out their website. Having a mediocre website can instantly wipe out any goodwill created in getting me to take a look at their site in the first place. Companies that make this often insurmountable mistake are destined to suffer high abandon rates and substandard acceptance of their business, product or service. Your website makes a first and lasting impression. When you use poor aesthetics, flow and content your visitors become indifferent and make a quick exit, never to return. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good example of this is &lt;a href="http://www.vertimax.com/"&gt;Vertimax&lt;/a&gt;. When I first met them I thought to myself, "How could this not be a runaway success?" Their product was being used by several well-known professional teams from the NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB as well as countless college teams. In addition, they had amazing testimonials in magazines like &lt;a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/players/08/15/core.davis0821/index.html"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.menshealth.com/cda/article.do?site=MensHealth&amp;amp;channel=fitness&amp;amp;category=workout.plans&amp;amp;conitem=e28eb0c7c8455010VgnVCM200000cee793cd____&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Men's Health&lt;/a&gt; from athletes at the pinnacle of their sport. More important is that they actually have a great, high-quality product with scientific proof that it helps build core strength. However, one look at their website makes you cast a cautious eye as to the merits of their lofty credentials. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rr3D2QbSIgI/AAAAAAAAAEs/-C8eRjJ80jk/s1600-h/vertimax.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_" alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rr3D2QbSIgI/AAAAAAAAAEs/-C8eRjJ80jk/s400/vertimax.JPG" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"&gt;&lt;img style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; background: 0% 50%; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial" alt="Posted by Picasa" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" align="middle" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond being a hodgepodge of colors, fonts, imagery and alignment, you don't know where to start with their copy or how to progress once your curiosity has been satisfied. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contrast that with a company like &lt;a href="http://www.bowflex.com/global/content_basic.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302038583&amp;amp;bmUID=1186860247197"&gt;Bowflex&lt;/a&gt; who uses concise and consistent aesthetics and flow to succinctly transition a prospect down the path of being a customer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rr4CAgbSIhI/AAAAAAAAAE0/3QOD0AFfq6M/s1600-h/bowflex.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rr4CAgbSIhI/AAAAAAAAAE0/3QOD0AFfq6M/s400/bowflex.JPG" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"&gt;&lt;img style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; background: 0% 50%; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial" alt="Posted by Picasa" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" align="middle" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of all the weapons in your marketing arsenal, be sure to invest in a website that will cast the best possible impression when stumbled upon by potential customers, partners, employees, investors and everyone else who matters. Spend the time and money to make sure that your website presents your business, product or service in such a way that makes it compelling, engaging and competent. Also, once your website is completed, don't rest on your laurels. Be ever vigilant in evolving your website to keep it current and well aligned to accepted design and usage principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those interested, &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_26/b4040416.htm?link_position=link1"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt; did a great job recently articulating some of the challenges companies face when trying to wrestle control of URLs that they thought they owned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:4ccecafe-b531-46c8-b32a-6527576ad53c" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/branding" rel="tag"&gt;branding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing" rel="tag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20myths" rel="tag"&gt;marketing myths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:61f0d1a9-1243-4b69-aae9-559d3cfa53e5" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;del.icio.us Tags: &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/branding" rel="tag"&gt;branding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing%20myths" rel="tag"&gt;marketing myths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing" rel="tag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/08/marketing-myths-that-can-kill-business_11.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rr3D2QbSIgI/AAAAAAAAAEs/-C8eRjJ80jk/s72-c/vertimax.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-7111619084620669657</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2007 10:10:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-08-08T07:52:45.519-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing myths</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>media relations</category><title>Marketing Myths That Can Kill a Business; Myth #2 - Media relations cannot be leveraged as an integrated marketing tool</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myth #2 - Media relations cannot be leveraged as an integrated marketing tool.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a very old school way of thinking about media relations. Gone are the days when media relations&amp;nbsp;functions as&amp;nbsp;a silo operation with the&amp;nbsp;narrowly defined&amp;nbsp;mission of putting press releases on the wire, performing outreach, pitching stories and coordinating events. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To effectively market a product or service, you must be prepared to use every available marketing tool. Today, more than any time in history, media relations plays a pivotal role in your integrated marketing toolset. With the universe of possible outlets --&amp;nbsp;such as consumer generated media and social media communities --&amp;nbsp;growing daily, you need to be ever vigilant in ensuring that your communications are shepherded to the best possible audience and tightly coupled to your marketing strategies and plans. To maximize coverage, your media strategy should target traditional media outlets as well as those inherent in Web 2.0.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good example of how media relations&amp;nbsp;plays a significant role in integrated marketing&amp;nbsp;can be seen&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;issuing&amp;nbsp;a press release announcing a new product, Pure Hitter Pro. Through outreach and impeccable timing, a producer&amp;nbsp;from ESPN Cold Pizza saw a great fit for the product in a Gizmo Girl segment they were preparing to do on new baseball technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;embed id="VideoPlayback" style="width: 400px; height: 326px" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1056958767979173485&amp;amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars=""&gt; &lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being profiled on ESPN Cold Pizza resulted in a massive spike in both site traffic and unit sales (greater then 400% increase over the previous week). Beyond driving Web traffic and sales, the piece was also used to establish credibility of the product for new visitors that were brought to the site via other marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Media relations is a critical component of any integrated marketing operation and should be leveraged to add value throughout the marketing continuum. Equally important, you must be dogged in your pursuit of media outlets as every day the opportunity to garner coverage for your product or service evolves and grows. Sure, everyone wants to be covered in a major trade or business periodical like &lt;a href="http://www.cio.com/"&gt;CIO Magazine&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/us"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. However, having a highly respected blogger, whose readers characterize your ideal prospect, write about your product or service can have an even more&amp;nbsp;dramatic impact on acceptance then coverage in a mainstream business or trade magazine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b5c00aa5-59dc-46bc-915b-b872d45d9981" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20myths" rel="tag"&gt;marketing myths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/media%20relations" rel="tag"&gt;media relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:e3275324-021e-4963-b186-0c17b4d45e78" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;del.icio.us Tags: &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing%20myths" rel="tag"&gt;marketing myths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/media%20relations" rel="tag"&gt;media relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/08/marketing-myths-that-can-kill-business.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-5828321335540277786</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2007 19:34:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-08-05T15:34:20.822-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>book review</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Management - Service Your Knowledge Leak</title><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;div style="margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/RrYWvwbSIfI/AAAAAAAAAEk/TMKEjfr9S0Q/s1600-h/books.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/RrYWvwbSIfI/AAAAAAAAAEk/TMKEjfr9S0Q/s400/books.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"&gt;&lt;img style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; background: 0% 50%; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial" alt="Posted by Picasa" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" align="middle" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I recall some time ago reading an adage to the effect that knowledge is a bucket with a slow leak in the bottom. To stay current and deliver value, you need to constantly refill your knowledge bucket. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know we live in an information-laden society. It often feels like we have precious little time to do everything that needs to be done in a given day. However, taking time each day to read will go a long way towards making you a&amp;nbsp;diverse contributor and invaluable member of the marketing leadership team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you own all or a piece of a contemporary marketing operation, some books that I recently read that&amp;nbsp;will add value to how you think about,&amp;nbsp;impact and run&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;marketing mission include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/blink/"&gt;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/thebook.php"&gt;Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven Levitt &amp;amp; Stephen Dubner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/"&gt;The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More by Chris Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.madetostick.com/"&gt;Made To Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Survive by Chip and Dan Heath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html"&gt;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of these timely books offer valuable business and marketing insights that would otherwise be&amp;nbsp;impossible to piece together or fully understand through other means.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a knowledge-based worker, it's important that you nurture and grow your marketing intellect through reading. Doing this will elicit curiosity and stretch your thinking when contemplating marketing strategies and plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My personal goal is to read for at least two hours each day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:d80cd1ac-1228-45ec-893c-803d5eec6af4" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/made%20to%20stick" rel="tag"&gt;made to stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/blink" rel="tag"&gt;blink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/freakonomics" rel="tag"&gt;freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/the%20long%20tail" rel="tag"&gt;the long tail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/the%20tipping%20point" rel="tag"&gt;the tipping point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:8462f996-07c4-4671-a93a-a7f5f6b6b822" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;del.icio.us Tags: &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/made%20to%20stick" rel="tag"&gt;made to stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/blink" rel="tag"&gt;blink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/freakonomics" rel="tag"&gt;freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/the%20long%20tail" rel="tag"&gt;the long tail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/the%20tipping%20point" rel="tag"&gt;the tipping point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/08/marketing-management-service-your.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/RrYWvwbSIfI/AAAAAAAAAEk/TMKEjfr9S0Q/s72-c/books.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-1934988588138598760</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2007 10:11:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-08-01T06:11:57.014-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Marketing Management - I Tip My Hat To RedBoots Digital Rodeo</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I posted an entry about the importance of &lt;a href="http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/07/marketing-management-make-your-company.html"&gt;making your company accessible&lt;/a&gt;. In the article, I mentioned my struggle to locate contact information for &lt;a href="http://rbdrodeo.com/"&gt;RedBoots Digital Rodeo&lt;/a&gt; after landing on their blog/website. Yesterday, I received an e-mail from Simon Heseltine,&amp;nbsp;RedBoots&amp;nbsp;Director of Search, acknowledging the anomaly and what they've done to &amp;nbsp;remedy it (see below). In this case they added a "Contact Us" menu pick that opens up a page with a phone number and e-mail address. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;div style="margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rq-YCQbSIeI/AAAAAAAAAEc/okmLRgKSwCM/s1600-h/RD_digital_rodeo.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rq-YCQbSIeI/AAAAAAAAAEc/okmLRgKSwCM/s400/RD_digital_rodeo.JPG" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"&gt;&lt;img style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; background: 0% 50%; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial" alt="Posted by Picasa" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" align="middle" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kudos to the team at RedBoots Digital Rodeo.&amp;nbsp; The fact that they took my post in the spirit for which it was intended and quickly addressed it is testimony to a class organization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:f401121f-e737-4e8d-a56f-7bcf1f8a782d" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tags/marketing" rel="tag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:34b3c5ec-a1d3-4920-a606-293ac0d01091" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"&gt;del.icio.us Tags: &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing%20management" rel="tag"&gt;marketing management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/marketing" rel="tag"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.marketingfishbowl.com/2007/08/marketing-management-i-tip-my-hat-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Gary Davis)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rq-YCQbSIeI/AAAAAAAAAEc/okmLRgKSwCM/s72-c/RD_digital_rodeo.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1683800859660911689.post-4926959371381540602</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2007 18:11:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-07-30T18:47:52.899-04:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>strategy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>branding</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>marketing management</category><title>Brand Management - AT&amp;T Does Not Equal Cingular</title><description>&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/RqoPFAbSIcI/AAAAAAAAAEM/Fw_7QoYIunc/s1600-h/att_does_not_equal_cingular.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_" style="clear: both; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px" alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/RqoPFAbSIcI/AAAAAAAAAEM/Fw_7QoYIunc/s160/att_does_not_equal_cingular.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"&gt;&lt;img style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; background: 0% 50%; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial" alt="Posted by Picasa" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" align="middle" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;From day one I felt AT&amp;amp;T's decision to rebrand Cingular as the "&lt;a href="http://www.att.com/gen/landing-pages?pid=3308"&gt;New AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;" was a bad idea from a brand perspective. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since Cingular arrived on the scene, it was perceived as a cool, hip wireless brand that did a phenomenal job at cultivating a great brand aura. Who can forget those "raising the bar" ads with the simple, yet easily distinguishable orange logo (a.k.a Jack)? Contrast that with AT&amp;amp;T where words like stoic, unresponsive, lethargic, monolithic and old come to mind. These are the types of words that are just waiting for a bad experience to take place to justify their gratuitous use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To me, this brand faux pas became very apparent during the launch of &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/"&gt;Apple's iPhone&lt;/a&gt; where the Apple stores had people waiting days to get a new iPhone, yet you could walk right into an AT&amp;amp;T store to purchase one from them without a wait. The brand blooper was exasperated when new users had difficulty activating their phones. According to an unscientific poll conducted by &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/01/poll-got-iphone-activation-problems/"&gt;engadget&lt;/a&gt;, roughly &lt;strong&gt;52&lt;/strong&gt; percent of voters are either having or have had issues activating their iPhone (see illustration below). My guess is a healthy portion of those users thought: "same old AT&amp;amp;T." It would not surprise me that some if not all of the adjectives reflected above as well as several others of the four letter variety were used extensively during their iPhone activation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;div style="margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rq5mcQbSIdI/AAAAAAAAAEU/cHPYfUygvoc/s1600-h/att_iphone_activation.JPG"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JAYZarcL6VM/Rq5mcQbSIdI/AAAAAAAAAEU/cHPYfUygvoc/s400/att_iphone_activation.JPG" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"&gt;&lt;img style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; background: 0% 50%; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial" alt="Posted by Picasa" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" align="middle" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recent launch of Apple's iPhone is a good example of why keeping the Cingular brand is relevant and necessary. Had it been Cingular who was at the blunt end of the activation criticism, I believe, consumers would have been more forgiving. As it is, they now have yet another reason to dislike all of AT&amp;amp;T as opposed to just taking issue with their wireless group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of this comes from a recent blog post by &lt;a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/"&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; aptly titled, &lt;a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/06/my-iphone-revie.html"&gt;My iPhone Review&lt;/a&gt;, where he discusses the arrival of a DSL line from AT&amp;amp;T that he did not order, and what he had to endure to get rid of DSL. The unwanted DSL line arrived about the same time as&amp;nbsp;the iPhone launched. His post goes a long way towards expressing the&amp;nbsp;frustration a user experiences when working through any type of issue with a company like AT&amp;amp;T.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that AT&amp;amp;T would be further ahead approaching brand management of their telecommunications subsidiaries using a&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.pg.com/en_US/index.jhtml"&gt;Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble&lt;/a&gt; style, where each respective product/offering defines the brand as opposed to a master, overarching brand strategy. In the new digital economy, consumers look for brands that they can identify with as opposed to a one size fits all brand, which is what AT&amp;amp;T serves up for its telecommunications customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you are a mega-brand like AT&amp;amp;T it is very difficult to keep the proper perspective when contemplating sweeping brand changes. The first, and rarely challenged, thought is let's bring everything under the overarching master brand. Be sure to contemplate all the subtleties at play using this method especially when branding occurs at the threshold of the digital economy.
