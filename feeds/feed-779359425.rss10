<title>An Appeal To Moderate Islam</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/28/135736/57</link>
<description>It is not the responsibility of non-Muslims to look past barbaric evil attack after barbaric evil attack and recognize that moderate Islam still exists. It is the responsibility of moderate Islam to rein in and destroy the madmen emanating from your societies. Are you too toothless or unwilling to do that?</description>

<title>The Making of a Mash/Lauter Tun</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/24/20244/381</link>
<description>This is a rewrite of this diary. People were encouraging towards making it a story. Citations will be provided for images since that jew bastard who runs the place hasn't enabled image tags yet.  Making beer is pretty easy, and if you've been following The Spoils of Wort, you probably have the basics down. Making beer, up to this point, has been:      Buy a can of extract (or four)  Steep the specialty grains to make "grain tea"  Bring it to a boil  Toss in hops at some intervals  Cool it, put it in a fermenter and toss in the yeast.       In our bag of tools, we're going to expand number two to eliminate step one. In terms of flavor, we're going to change how many fermentables are present in the wort (body) and the sweetness (enzyme profile).</description>

<title>QNX 6.4 &gt; 6.3</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/20/12414/596</link>
<description>I had been running QNX 6.3 on my trusty old 1.4 GHz Pentium III system with two gigs of memory for the last couple years and it was alright. Never quite fast enough despite decent hardware (P3 chips were 2x as fast as P4s clock per clock, don't whine otherwise) and limited hardware support, I was looking forward to the upgrade because, finally, after four years I might get a better-optimized system.</description>

<description>The fridge in the kitchen nearest to me at my place of work has a bunch of those dictionary fridge magnets on it. Over the last few months the face of the fridge has been the subject of a fascinating battle between the forces of good and evil. </description>

<title>Two Essays on Objectivist Ethics</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/18/194559/27</link>
<description>Two essays from Ayn Rand's The Virtue of Selfishness are reprinted in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal as the ethical basis for her moral defense of capitalism.    "Man's Rights" and "The Nature of Government" are pedestrian defenses of a natural law conception of man's natural rights and of a concept of government that mixes enumerated powers and individual rights with the Weberian concept of the state.    In positing individual rights and enumerated powers as defenses against arbitrary exercise of power, Rand employs arbitrary qualifiers in her concept-building, rendering her definitions of crucial terms meaningless for both practical and political purposes.</description>

<title>Beefeater's holocaust</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/18/154445/99</link>
<description>A recent episode of Boston Legal featured a courtroom drama where a farmer filed suit in order to be able to test all of her herd for BSE1/vCJD, the agent which causes "mad cow" disease (otherwise known a bovine spongioform encephalopathy) in cows and variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease in unfortunate beefeaters. In TV land, the farmer won and was allowed to test her herd and advertise the results. In reality, the USDA prohibits testing of cattle for BSE (except by the USDA) and the FDA has refused to even allow applications by biotech/pharma companies for newer generation quick blood and tissue tests for BSE.</description>

<title>Why the Big 3 Bailout is Bullshit: Cadillacs Made in China</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/18/93514/227</link>
<description>First, they say that between 160,000 and 3 million manufacturing jobs are on the line, but then turn around and blame the unions (the organization that represents those workers). In fact, foreign (mainly Japanese) automakers employ almost as many Americans as the "Big 3" do (113,000). Helping GM, Ford, and Chrysler could actually hurt those American auto-workers at non-Big 3 factories. Moreover, even according to optimistic estimates, the crappy clunkers Detroit has been making for years will be far less feasible in the coming worldwide depression than the smaller, cheaper more sensible Japanese brand cars which are (by % of parts/labor) MORE AMERICAN than the "American" cars. (GM parts are often made in China, whereas cars like the Honda Accord are 70% American-made).</description>

<title>FreeBSD Owes Apple Big</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/17/16268/141</link>
<description>The other day, while booting my eight-core 3.2 GHz Mac Pro with 32 GB RAM, I watched my system startup messages (nvram boot-args="-v") and thought of Darwin's origins at NeXT as a pastiche of academic research and hacker hobby. Darwin has come so far and exhibits the best of long-term software engineering. But while thinking of how far Darwin has come, I also thought of all it has given back to FreeBSD. By the time my Mac had loaded my desktop, I was at work researching just how much FreeBSD owes Apple.</description>

<title>Let The Games Begin</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/8/132750/758</link>
<description>First off, I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG. So much for predictions of a year and a half ago.  Looking back it's easy to see what happened. There is a collective sigh of relief throughout the U.S. and most of the world as Obama became President-elect Obama. Even so there is still 40+% of America that voted for McCain. President-elect Obama's calls for national unity will likely not last more than 30 days past his inauguration. I hope I am wrong.</description>

<title>The Silver Lining for California's Gay Marriage Ban</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/11/6/45342/9914</link>
<description>On election day, Californians narrowly approved Proposition 8, an initiative to amend the state constitution to include "only marriage between a man and a woman is valid."  Undoubtedly this vote was a setback for gay rights throughout the country, but upon closer inspection there is a lot of silver lining in the results.</description>
