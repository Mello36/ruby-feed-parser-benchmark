<p>As all writers know, <strong>words are immensely powerful</strong>. You can make readers laugh or cry with fewer than a hundred of them. You can part people from their money. You can make someone&#8217;s day. You can change the course of lives.</p>
<p>And you don’t have to be <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">Spider-Man</a> to know that “with great power comes great responsibility.” But why not let ol’ Spidey give us some tips for responsible word power?</p>
<p><span id="more-1779"></span></p>
<h3>Spidey Says: Your Writing Should Be Honest</h3>
<p>Of course you should check facts and, where possible, cite sources in your articles. That’s just the basics. Being honest in your writing goes further than that. </p>
<p>It means you’re responsible for including information that you might prefer to omit. If you’re reviewing a product on your blog, for instance, you need to give the bad as well as the good.</p>
<p>It actually builds your credibility and often increases sales to admit the downside. Any good copywriter will tell you that.</p>
<p>Being honest also means sharing something of yourself with the reader. It means being willing to put <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/the-secret-of-life/">your own experiences on the page</a>. It means using your heart, and not just your brain, to produce what you write. It may even mean turning down a copywriting job if you feel that you cannot honestly advocate the service or product that you’re asked to write about.</p>
<h3>Spidey Says: Your Writing Should Be Good</h3>
<p>Along with every other writer, you’re responsible for the future of language. That means doing the best you can to produce a polished piece of writing, without getting lazy or sloppy in your rush to finish the job. “Good writing” means different things to different people – but at least hold yourself to your own standards. </p>
<p>That might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use words that make you cringe when you read them.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aliventures.com/using-powerful-words-sparingly.html">Use powerful words sparingly</a>. </li>
<li>Don’t go for the easy cliché or stock phrase.</li>
<li>Avoid woolly language and euphemisms – be confident enough to say what you mean, and where appropriate, don’t pull your punches.</li>
<li>Don’t make <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/5-common-mistakes-that-make-you-look-dumb/">simple grammatical mistakes</a> or <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/punctuation-mistakes/">punctuation errors</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spidey Says: Your Writing Should Be Clear</h3>
<p>A piece of writing might be perfectly “good” but incomprehensible. Take care to express your words in a way your audience understands. Unless you’re writing an academic paper, or a very technical software manual, express yourself in “layman’s terms”.</p>
<p>No reader will struggle through advertising copy that makes them feel stupid. Avoid jargon. Spell out acronyms – even if you think everyone knows them. What will better engage your readers: using long words to show off your vocabulary, or using short, direct words to demonstrate your ability to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/write-with-clarity/">write clearly and vividly</a>?</p>
<h3>Spidey Says: Your Writing is a Reflection of You</h3>
<p>When you’ve finished a piece – article, blog post, direct marketing letter – consider whether you’d be glad to have your name associated with it. Even if it’s ghost-written, is it something you’d want people to know was yours?</p>
<p>If you have reservations, take a good hard look at what you’ve written. Are there places where you’ve misled readers? Have you exaggerated the benefits of a product in a way that’s only going to lead to an unhappy customer? Have you left clumsy phrases or poorly-expressed sentences in the piece?</p>
<p>Don’t send off a project to the client, or publish the article on your site or in your newsletter, until you feel it’s something you can proudly put your name on.</p>
<p>What about you? Do you have other criteria that guide the use of your word power?</p>

<p>When I started blogging on my own several months ago after leaving the magazine world, there were two platforms I knew I needed to get started: A blog and a forum. I learned from my previous blog for the magazine that the two platforms complement one another perfectly.</p>
<p>I think all bloggers should consider the benefits of having a forum linked to their blog. Here are three of the advantages I’ve found:</p>
<p><span id="more-1727"></span><strong>1. A forum is a breeding ground for ideas</strong>. To be an effective blogger, you need to know what people are chatting about to give them great content, answer their questions, and be of service. Tuning in to the chatter on a forum sparks ideas for blog posts.</p>
<p>For example, I knew from reading my forum threads that finding an agent was a huge concern, so I decided to start interviewing agents for my blog. The blog provides a desirable connection for my forum members, and the forum, in turn, gives the blog a built-in audience.</p>
<p><strong>2. A forum fosters group dialogue</strong>. Sure, most blogs allow comments. But comments aren’t really a dialogue, they’re a response to a monologue. The blogger controls the flow of information on a blog. A forum is a far better platform for conversations and relationships to develop—and this is where community building really takes off.</p>
<p><strong>3. A forum is a great place to find guest posters</strong>. This is the perfect venue to find people with compelling ideas and an engaging writing style to guest post on your blog.</p>
<p>I’ve had guest posts from my forum members almost since the start of my blog. One forum member posted a thread about getting duped by a shady self-publishing company. I knew that was perfect blog fodder and I asked this writer for a guest post, which he seemed happy to write for me. </p>
<p>Also recently, I asked several forum members to do guest posts on participating in NanoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month), an event that’s important to my community, but that I wasn’t participating in. These guest posts were especially well received and commented on. I think first-hand accounts always make for better blog posts than third-person pieces.</p>
<p>If you are interested in starting up your own forum, there are many platforms available including open source software like phpBB. I decided to go with VBulletin, which costs $180 to own outright, because I like the interface and it offers a subscription-based forum service that I’m going to use for classes and workshops.  </p>
<p>Now, I’m not going to tell you that a forum is an easy thing to build and manage. In fact, if it seems like too much of a commitment, you may be better off frequenting a well-run forum that caters to your subject matter. A good forum requires almost-daily TLC.</p>
<p>But if you’re a blogger who wants to grow your community—once you do have your own forum, you’ll never want to be without one again.</p>

<p><em>You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.</em> ~Inigo Montoya, <em>The Princess Bride</em></p>
<p>It may be inconceivable for <em>you</em> to misuse a word, but a quick look around the web reveals plenty of people doing it. And it’s all too easy when we hear or see others use words incorrectly and parrot them without knowing it’s wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-1695"></span>We know by now that great copy and content often purposefully break the rules of grammar. It’s only when you break the rules by <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/grammar-writing-mistakes/">mistake</a> that you <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/5-common-mistakes-that-make-you-look-dumb/">look dumb</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at 27 commonly misused words. Some are common mistakes that can cost you when trying to keep a reader’s attention. Others are more obscure and just interesting to know.</p>
<h3>Adverse / Averse</h3>
<p><em>Adverse</em> means unfavorable. <em>Averse</em> means reluctant.</p>
<h3>Afterwards</h3>
<p><em>Afterwards</em> is wrong in American English. It’s <em>afterward</em>.</p>
<h3>Complement / Compliment </h3>
<p>I see this one all the time. <em>Complement</em> is something that adds to or supplements something else. <em>Compliment</em> is something nice someone says about you.</p>
<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p><em>Criteria</em> is plural, and the singular form is <em>criterion</em>. If someone tells you they have only one criteria, you can quickly interject and offer that it be they get a clue.</p>
<h3>Farther / Further</h3>
<p><em>Farther</em> is talking about a physical distance. </p>
<p>“How much farther is Disney World, Daddy?”</p>
<p><em>Further</em> is talking about an extension of time or degree.</p>
<p>“Take your business further by reading Copyblogger.”</p>
<h3>Fewer / Less </h3>
<p>If you can count it, use <em>fewer</em>. If you can’t, use <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>“James has less incentive to do what I say.”</p>
<p>“Tony has fewer subscribers since he stopped blogging.”</p>
<h3>Historic / Historical </h3>
<p><em>Historic</em> means an important event. <em>Historical</em> means something that happened in the past.</p>
<h3>Hopefully </h3>
<p>This word is used incorrectly so much (including by me) it may be too late. But let’s make you smarter anyway. The old school rule is you only use <em>hopefully</em> if you&#8217;re describing the way someone spoke, appeared, or acted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart</strong>: 	I hope she says yes.</li>
<li><strong>Wrong</strong>: 	Hopefully, she says yes.</li>
<li><strong>Wrong</strong>: 	Hopefully, the weather will be good.</l
<li><strong>Smart</strong>: 	It is hoped that the weather cooperates.</li>
<li><strong>Smart</strong>: 	She eyed the engagement ring hopefully.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Imply / Infer</h3>
<p><em>Imply</em> means to suggest indirectly (you’re sending a subtle message). To <em>infer</em> is to come to a conclusion based on information (you’re interpreting a message).</p>
<h3>Insure / Ensure </h3>
<p><em>Insure</em> is only correct when you call up Geico or State Farm for coverage. <em>Ensure</em> means to guarantee, and that’s most often what you’re trying to say, right?</p>
<h3>Irregardless</h3>
<p><em>Irregardless</em> is not a word. Use <em>regardless</em> or <em>irrespective</em>.</p>
<h3>Literally</h3>
<p>“I’m literally starving to death.”</p>
<p>No, odds are, you’re not.</p>
<p><em>Literally</em> means <em>exactly</em> what you say is accurate, no metaphors or analogies. Everything else is <em>figurative</em> (relative, a figure of speech).</p>
<h3>Premier / Premiere </h3>
<p><em>Premier</em> is the first and best in status or importance, or a prime minister. <em>Premiere</em> is the opening night of <em>Star Wars 8: George Wants More Money</em>.</p>
<h3>Principal / Principle</h3>
<p><em>Principal</em> when used as a noun means the top dog; as an adjective, it means the most important of any set. <em>Principle</em> is a noun meaning a fundamental truth, a law, a rule that always applies, or a code of conduct.</p>
<h3>Towards</h3>
<p><em>Towards</em> is wrong in American English. It’s <em>toward</em>. I went 41 years not being sure about this one.</p>
<h3>Unique</h3>
<p>Unique means (literally) one of a kind. Saying something is <em>very</em> or <em>truly</em> unique is wacked. It’s either a purple cow or it isn’t.</p>
<h3>Who / Whom</h3>
<p>This one is a lost cause, but let’s go down swinging. The way to deal with the <em>who</em> versus <em>whom</em> quandary is a simple substitution method.</p>
<p>First, a refresher on subjects and objects.</p>
<p>Subjects do the action:</p>
<p>“He/she/we like(s) to rock the house.”</p>
<p>Objects receive the action:</p>
<p>“The rock star sneered at him/her/us.”</p>
<p>Use <em>who</em> for subjects and <em>whom</em> for objects.</p>
<p><em>Subjects</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who wrote this blog post?</li>
<li>Who is speaking at the conference?</li>
<li>Who is going to clean up this mess?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Objects</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whom are you going to write about?</li>
<li>Whom did he blame for the Google Slap?</li>
<li>Whom did he bait for the links?</li>
</ul>
<p>Truth is, <em>whom</em> just doesn’t sound right in many situations where it&#8217;s correct, especially in the US. You now know the rule… feel free to break it.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you haven’t seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Princess-Bride-20th-Anniversary/dp/B000TJBNHG/">The Princess Bride</a> because you think it must suck based on the title, get over it.

<p>The role of web writers has changed. Just a few short years ago, the content on most websites was boring and factual, just a profile of monotonous company information. </p>
<p>Today, the content on websites that work looks very different indeed.</p>
<p>Effective web writers are moving away from bland, factual information. Readers won’t settle for that anymore.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t interesting. It isn&#8217;t compelling.</p>
<p><span id="more-1679"></span>Facts don&#8217;t stir emotions and encourage people to take action. Facts don&#8217;t sell until people look to rationalize the buying decision they’ve made at an emotional level.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to transform your website into a story.</p>
<p>In fact, web writers themselves must undergo a transformation. They must <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/the-savvy-copywriter%E2%80%99s-advantage-creative-storytelling/">become storytellers.</a></p>
<p>It makes sense. Stories are captivating. They draw people in with a good hook. They engage the mind, invoking mental imagery as people read the words. <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/4-cs-of-quality-content/">Good stories are jewels</a> we cherish and share.</p>
<p>We all relate to stories and their concepts on very personal levels – and we remember them. When we face similar situations, we bring back the messages, the lessons, and the outcomes of the stories we bring to mind. </p>
<p>And we act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Stimulate All the Senses or Lose the Sale</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-a-story/">Stories work</a>. Our brains retain more information when all our senses are stimulated. We can recall facts if we&#8217;ve memorized them, but we have a much easier time bringing stories to mind. </p>
<p>Think of your favorite memory. Can you see it in your mind? Do you remember what you noticed that day, the colors around you, the sounds that you heard? Can you recall the feelings you had in that very moment? </p>
<p>Think about how long you&#8217;ve retained that memory. Probably a long time, and you could most likely tell someone else the story easily. </p>
<p>Now think about how long you&#8217;ve retained the words of the last website you&#8217;ve read.</p>
<h3>Business Stories Beat Bland Brochure Sites</h3>
<p>Storytelling has become <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/story-blog-post/">integral to content</a> in the virtual world. From website content to sales copy to press releases, stories are increasing in number every day. Web writers have realized the value of stories for business – and there is value indeed.</p>
<p>Stories deliver messages in an intriguing, memorable way. Business owners want and need their audience to remember, to take the desired action. A writer&#8217;s content must paint pictures and tell stories to encourage that action. </p>
<p>When used for marketing, content must draw analogies between concepts to help readers understand. It must tap pain, desire and anticipation, helping readers feel something deep within themselves. Great content creates a mood so that people experience the moment on a level beyond logic and fact.</p>
<p>The words are just the medium; the story lingers on.</p>
<h3>Changing Your Sites into Stories</h3>
<p>Businesses need to tap into the potential of stories and benefit from this <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/content-success/">new age of content marketing</a>. Websites need to move away from listing data and facts or monotone features that just don&#8217;t engage readers. </p>
<p>Take a moment to look at the content on your site or the words you&#8217;re writing for a client. Read them. Can you see the images in your mind? Are your emotions stirred? Are those emotions naturally tied to your solution?</p>
<p>In other words… is your website telling a story? </p>
<p>More importantly, is it a story that sells?</p>

<p><em>I have made this letter longer than usual, only because I have not had time to make it shorter.</em> ~Blaise Pascal (1623-1662).</p>
<p>We are inundated with information.  People are starved for time and as such they greatly respect and value short correspondence, articles and blog posts.</p>
<p>If you want people to read something, make it short and concise.  A paragraph that runs five sentences long is daunting and there is a good chance that the reader will not read it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1667"></span>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use short words</strong>: They are easier to understand &#8212; so use simple English even if it offends your sense of literacy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use dashes to shorten up a sentence</strong>: Most readers are not grammatical experts and value sentences that are more in line with the way they speak &#8212; so use dashes to make the message clear.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use bullet points and numbered paragraphs</strong>: They <em>keep</em> the message clear and organized in our minds.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use plenty of space</strong>: The more white background space on the page, the easier it is to read the black text.  Double spacing text is easier to read than single spacing.</p>
<p>If you’re reading a magazine and an article is six pages of text, you might decide to read it later.  And later never comes.  If the article is a well-organized one or two pages with bullet points and short paragraphs, there’s a better chance it will be read right away.</p>
<p>The strain on our 21st century attention would be unimaginable to those who lived in the 19th century. And yet&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p> I notice that you use plain, simple language, short words and brief sentences. That is the way to write English - it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; don&#8217;t let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in.</p>
<p>~Mark Twain, March 20, 1880</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of people saying they are new to blogging in the comments lately, so I definitely thought this was worth a mention. Yaro Starak has developed quite a reputation as a blogging mentor, but now he&#8217;s reaching out to those who are much newer to the blog life.</p>
<p>First of all, Yaro and his new partner (ahh&#8230; partners!) have released the free <a href="http://www.becomeablogger.com/go.php?offer=copyblogge&#038;pid=3&#038;u=http://www.becomeablogger.com/roadmap/">Roadmap Report</a> - a guide to becoming a blogger. I like the emphasis they place on multimedia, which is the way things are headed without doubt (they even have an audio version of the report).</p>
<p>Continuing to walk the multimedia talk, the pair have also released a series of <a href="http://www.becomeablogger.com/go.php?offer=copyblogge&#038;pid=3&#038;u=http://www.becomeablogger.com">10 free Become a Blogger videos</a>. Nice production and solid information for the newbie blogger.</p>
<p>Check this stuff out&#8230; Yaro knows what he&#8217;s talking about. And he&#8217;s nice, too. <img src='http://www.copyblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />

<p>A little over one month from now, you could be sitting in Seth Godin&#8217;s office, working as his apprentice. <em>The</em> Seth Godin. The best-selling author, maybe the most respected marketing mind in the online world, and the web&#8217;s most beloved bald guy. Yeah, him.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re selected, you&#8217;ll spend the next six months with Seth and his team. It&#8217;ll be like an MBA, except better. You&#8217;ll be learning how to change the world&#8230; and he&#8217;s going to teach you for free.</p>
<p>The catch?</p>
<p><span id="more-1624"></span>You have to convince Seth that you&#8217;re worthy of this opportunity and be willing to drop everything to seize it. Admittedly, he has some pretty high standards, but Copyblogger readers are some pretty amazing people, right? So I figured I&#8217;d better spread the word.</p>
<p>By the way, the deadline for applications is December 14. So, if you think this might apply to you, then you&#8217;d better hurry. You&#8217;re automatically disqualified if you&#8217;re late.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/Alternative-MBA">Check out the details here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: You know how we&#8217;ve been talking about the <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-i-hijacked-copyblogger/">power of apprenticeships</a>? Well, this is it. If you&#8217;re selected, this apprenticeship will change your life. I have no doubt.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/johnny_bunko.jpg" alt="Johnny Bunko" width="150" height="233" /></p>
<p>I’ve been a fan of Daniel Pink since the article “Free Agent Nation” appeared in the 12th issue of <em>Fast Company</em> in December of 1997. Somehow, we ended up chatting over email, which led to a meeting over steaming plates of migas at the Magnolia Café in Austin. Next thing you know, my story (at the time) is featured in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Agent-Nation-Working-Yourself/dp/0446678791">Free Agent Nation</a>, the book.</p>
<p>Next, Pink released the New York Times Bestseller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717">A Whole New Mind</a>, a book that heavily influenced me and my <a href="http://lateralaction.com/about/">Lateral Action</a> co-conspirators. Dan rightly identified creativity and innovation as the key to economic survival in the “Conceptual Age,” and set the stage for the shift in the types of people and thinking that lead to continued business success in mature economies.</p>
<p>But then he did something really interesting.</p>
<p><span id="more-1607"></span>Dan released a career guide that reveals the six essential lessons for thriving in the world of work. Oddly enough, this celebrated bestselling author titled his new book <a href="http://www.johnnybunko.com/">The Adventures of Johnny Bunko</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, the title isn’t that odd when you consider that Johnny Bunko is America’s first business book in the Japanese comic format known as manga. The odd thing is… it totally works.</p>
<p>Here are the six questions I asked Dan Pink about the persuasive storytelling possibilities of manga and the graphic novel format in general:</p>
<h3>1. Tell us a bit about Johnny Bunko and what inspired you to do this project.</h3>
<p>Johnny Bunko is the first American business book in manga &#8212; a 160-page graphic novel career guide that outlines the six key principles of satisfying, productive careers through the story of bumbling Everyman named Johnny Bunko. </p>
<p>There were two inspirations for it. </p>
<p>First, over the last several years, I became extremely interested in manga &#8212; so much so that I went to Japan for a couple of months in 2007 to study the manga industry. There I discovered that manga played a very different role than comics played in the U.S. In Japan, comics are truly a mass medium &#8212; a bit like television. You can tell any kind of story, convey any kind of idea, advance any kind of argument using this powerful form. It seemed odd &#8212; to me, at least &#8212; that America&#8217;s view of what comics could do was so limited.</p>
<p>Second, I began to think about the role of books themselves in a world of Google. Take something like career information.  *Tactical*career  information &#8212; what keywords to put in a resume, what a company does, etc &#8212; is available online instantly and for free. It seemed ludicrous to memorialize that sort of information on the pages of a book and try to sell it. Books simply are no longer valuable ways to convey that sort of material. But that got me wondering what books can do that Google cannot. And I still think books are better at providing strategic, big picture information &#8212; especially in narrative form.  </p>
<p>So combining these two ideas, in a fit of irrational exuberance, I decided to do America&#8217;s first business book in manga. </p>
<h3>2. That’s the fascinating part… manga as a teaching and persuasion format. Will it catch on in the US beyond the Bunko?</h3>
<p>I think it&#8217;s inevitable. It&#8217;s just a matter of when. What&#8217;s interesting, though, is how much this is taking off overseas, where there are legions of young people entering white-collar work for the first time. We did nearly as many foreign deals for BUNKO in the first two months as we did for A WHOLE NEW MIND in the first two years. </p>
<h3>3. You’re a self-confessed “prose guy.” How hard was it for you to write Johnny Bunko?</h3>
<p>It was challenging.  Telling stories with pictures wasn&#8217;t at my fingertips. That&#8217;s why I was so lucky to have a collaborator like Rob Ten Pas, the insanely talented guy who did the art for the book. My tendency was to explain everything. But Rob showed me just how much narrative freight the pictures carry. As I moved along in the process, I found myself somewhat maniacally trying to cut as many words as I could to make the story move even faster. </p>
<h3>4. When we first chatted about this project before Bunko came out, you touted the format as effective for persuasion. After reading it for myself, I agree. Why do you think that is?</h3>
<p>Speed.  Ezra Pound once said that great poetry achieved &#8220;maximum efficiency of expression.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s true of manga. It&#8217;s more than simply words adorned with pictures or pictures adorned with words. It&#8217;s an entirely different medium in which the words and images achieve something of a multiplier effect. And because it&#8217;s also a narrative, it has an incredible power both to absorb the reader and to make its message stick.  </p>
<h3>5. I just picked up the award-winning <em>Watchmen</em> graphic novel to become better acquainted with this form of storytelling. Any recommendations that helped you?</h3>
<p>UNDERSTANDING COMICS by Scott McCloud is one of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read. For me, it demystified comics and &#8212; odd as it sounds &#8212; made them even more fascinating. From Japan, I love the KOSAKU SHIMA series as well as the amazing (and sometimes, amazingly weird) work of Osamu Tezuka. Among American and other non-Japanese graphic works I like are: FUN HOME, PYONGYANG, PERSEPOLIS, and, of course, MAUS.</p>
<h3>6. What’s next from Dan Pink?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m hard at work on a book about the science and economics of human motivation. I&#8217;m looking at why what we think motivates people is just plain wrong. And I&#8217;ll show, based on 30 years of amazing psychological research, how readers can unlock their own true inner motivation as a pathway to better performance.<br />

Thanks to Dan for becoming Copyblogger’s first ever interview subject. I’ll hopefully be doing more of these, perhaps in a variety of media formats.</p>
<p>In the meantime… <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594482918">pick up Johnny Bunko</a>. It may spark some great ideas for projects. Or, just buy it for your favorite confused, aimless soul stuck in a dead-end job as a holiday gift. It really is the last career guide anyone ever needs.</p>
