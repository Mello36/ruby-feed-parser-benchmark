			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Sarah Lacy, tech journalist for Business Week, <a href="http://www.sarahlacy.com/sarahlacy/2008/07/really-is-it-cu.html">has a post that demonstrates well</a> why I am really trying to get off of the PR bandwagon.</p>
<p>See, on Sunday night a ton of blog posts all went up. Most of which were pretty congratulatory and hopeful that there was a &#8220;Google competitor.&#8221; Tech journalists desperately want there to be a competitor to Google. Why? Monopolies are boring to cover. The best tool a story teller has is when there&#8217;s conflict. I like to tell people this world is just like high school. Think back to high school.</p>
<p>In your high school, did anyone talk about the geeky kid who stayed after school to build a science fair project? In my school, which had lots of geeky kids, no, not usually. But if there was a fight in the quad would everyone talk about the fight for days afterward? Yes.</p>
<p>Journalists thrive off of conflict. That&#8217;s why we want a competitor to Google so badly and why we play up every startup that comes along that even attempts to compete with Google.</p>
<p>The problem is that competiting head on with Google is not something that a startup can do.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say someone really comes out with a breakthrough idea in search (which would be a feat all on its own, since Microsoft and Yahoo are spending tons of engineering time trying to find something breakthrough too). If they got all the hype that Cuil did (NPR and CNN played it up, not just tech bloggers) and people really liked it, they would spread it around like wild fire.</p>
<p>Do you have any clue about the infrastructure that Google has in place to handle the kind of scale that it sees? Try half a million servers. Half a million!!!</p>
<p>Think about that. How much money does that take to build out? Hint: a lot more than $30 million that was invested in Cuil.</p>
<p>So, Cuil set itself up for a bad PR result in the end. Either it wouldn&#8217;t meet the expections (which is what happened after people started testing it) or it would fall over and fail whale like Twitter has been for the past few months (because it wasn&#8217;t built to handle the scale).</p>
<p>Notice that other search companies don&#8217;t build up their PR like that. Mahalo never says it&#8217;s going to be a Google Killer, just that it&#8217;s going to do some number of searches better. In fact, Mahalo uses Google on its own pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why PR works and why I want off</strong></p>
<p>Note that Lacy said she wasn&#8217;t pre-briefed on Cuil (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/29/how-to-lose-your-cuil-20-seconds-after-launch/">Techcrunch says</a> that the company briefed every tech blogger and kept them from trying the service before release). That&#8217;s not true: I wasn&#8217;t briefed, either. But now, go back and look at <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080728/p94#a080728p94">the TechMeme rankings</a>. Were either my post (which was harsh, but fair, but published several hours after the original wave of PR-briefed bloggers and journalists) or Lacy&#8217;s on there? No.</p>
<p>See, if you want to earn links and attention in this world you&#8217;ve got to be first, or at least among the first articles to go out. I&#8217;ve seen this time and time again. I call it the Techmeme game.</p>
<p>But it affects Digg and Reddit and FriendFeed, too. The stories that got discussed the most on those were usually among the first crowd.</p>
<p>I guess what I&#8217;m really saying is that I&#8217;m going back to what makes me passionate. I don&#8217;t get passionate when reading a press release, or listening ot some executive on a conference call (I was dragged onto one of those the other day and I stopped it mid-stream, saying, &#8220;can I come and see you face-to-face?&#8221;)</p>
<p>I also find that I&#8217;m getting back to reading <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14480565058256660224">my Google Reader feeds</a>, looking for other people who are truly passionate about technology or business and who are looking for innovative approaches to either.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a TON of interesting blogs there that never will get to Digg or Techmeme. Same thing over on FriendFeed. Lots of interesting stuff being discussed on the Internet that never will get the &#8220;Cuil&#8221; treatment, but is worth your checking out.</p>
<p>For instance, I&#8217;m just over the top about <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>. How did I miss that for so long? Funny that a PR team brought me that, too. So, sometimes this game DOES work out, but note that I didn&#8217;t try to be first to get Evernote, I just kept seeing it getting praise from the bloggers I read.</p>
<p>Anyway, help us all get off the PR bandwagon. What are you passionate about? If you could go anywhere in the world and meet with any geek, executive, or company, who would it be?</p>
<p>What are you finding is bringing real value to your life? Hey, even go outside the tech industry. Is there something we should all be checking out and giving as much attention to as we&#8217;re giving to Cuil?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>&#8230;you believe Microsoft is actually going to have a completely rewritten Operating System before Bill Gates dies (which might be 20 to 40 more years).</p>
<p>Unfortunately journalists, <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/MICROSOFT_S_PLANS_FOR_POST_WINDOWS_OS_REVEALED/About_CLOUDCOMPUTING_and_MOBILEDEVELOPMENT_and_NET_and_SOASAAS_and_SOFTWAREDEVELOPMENT_and_WINDOWS_and_MICROSOFT/32627">like this one in Software Development Times</a>, love to make it seem that Microsoft is working hard on a new, completely rewritten, operating system that will solve all the world&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>Let me assure you they are not. At least not one that&#8217;ll be productized before my 10-month-old son sees his 10th birthday.</p>
<p>So, what is the Midori team doing?</p>
<p>Well, THAT is an interesting question that I&#8217;d love to ask Eric Rudder.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my theory: it&#8217;s a forcing function on the .NET team.</p>
<p>See, Bill Gates wants to make it possible to use a LOT more .NET in operating systems. That&#8217;s really what went wrong with Longhorn, er, Vista. Gates tried to make too much of the operating system dependent on .NET and .NET just wasn&#8217;t ready for an operating-system-level deployment/use case yet.</p>
<p>It was like trying to build a 100-story building, getting to level 50, and noticing that the thing is starting to lean. They had to tear it all the way down, put a new foundation in, and rebuild. That&#8217;s what happened to the Longhorn team. The fact that Vista got done at all is a pretty amazing engineering feat that software engineering schools should be studying for years.</p>
<p>Anyway, how would it be a forcing function? Well, by building an OS completely in .NET they can discover where .NET is deficient. They can use it to bug the .NET team to improve that system until they get it good enough to use it underneath a new operating system.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it takes them 10 years to iterate through all the things that .NET needs to do to become a real operating-system-level platform/language. Imagine then that Microsoft could roll that stuff into a version of Windows. Wow, wouldn&#8217;t that be useful to have rafts of the OS all built on .NET and hosting a new kind of .NET app?</p>
<p>Imagine writing drivers in .NET code. Or networking infrastructure. Or other things deep down inside the OS.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re getting someplace.</p>
<p>One other reason a total rewrite wouldn&#8217;t be done? Bill Gates believes strongly that you shouldn&#8217;t break old apps. Lotus 123 still runs on Vista. As long as Bill is around they won&#8217;t break those old apps. A total rewrite would break all sorts of apps.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think Microsoft is up to?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>People have been talking about Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com">Mojave Experiment</a>&#8221; all day. What did they do? They demoed a &#8220;future operating system&#8221; to end users, got their feedback, usually positive, and <a href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com">then told them it was actually Windows Vista</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first marketing in some time that made me think Microsoft&#8217;s marketing department had a clue about how to deal with its perception problem. Amazing to me that it took so long.</p>
<p>But when I see other Microsoft advertising, why isn&#8217;t it aspirational? Why doesn&#8217;t it just SHOW something cool you can do with Vista? Or with any of its other products?</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I&#8217;m using Windows Vista to type this to you. My wife and I have been having this argument about Windows. I&#8217;ve been having her use a Lenovo X300 laptop that&#8217;s really sexy. But she keeps asking for her Mac back. Why? She says it feels better and is nicer to use (when we left Podtech she had to return her Mac). My son isn&#8217;t helping, either. He makes fun of us for using non-Mac machines. He even was arguing with HP&#8217;s head of marketing last week about how much better Apple&#8217;s machines are.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d love to see is a head-to-head competition. Take both home for a week. Which one do you return?</p>
<p>Anyway, all this reminds me of is the power of a good demo. Actually, this is what I have loved about Apple&#8217;s stores whenever I go in: they are usually demoing what their machines can do. Walk in and they show you how to do all sorts of stuff from podcasting to digital photography. At the San Francisco store you can sit there and take tons of classes for free and they are usually pretty good and aimed at non-passionate users who are trying to do something specific with their machines.</p>
<p>Question: have you seen a Microsoft advertisment lately where Microsoft talks about what their machines can do? Have you seen an advertisment that shows you their <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/">WorldWide Telescope</a>, for instance (that is still my favorite demo of 2008)? Or <a href="http://labs.live.com/Silverlight+2+Deep+Zoom.aspx">Microsoft&#8217;s Deep Zoom</a>? Or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/index.html">Microsoft&#8217;s Surface</a>? Or <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">Microsoft Photosynth</a> (my favorite demo of 2006)?</p>
<p>These are all wonderful technologies that demo very well, but if Microsoft is able to find so many people who&#8217;ve just heard that Vista is crappy, but who haven&#8217;t actually seen it for themselves (that&#8217;s what the Mojave Project was really all about), imagine how many people who think that Microsoft isn&#8217;t an innovative company who haven&#8217;t seen any of Microsoft&#8217;s very real innovations?</p>
<p>Personally, whoever buys and makes Microsoft&#8217;s advertising should be, well, let&#8217;s just say &#8220;Starbucked&#8221; since they laid off about 900 people today. It&#8217;s amazingly bad and it doesn&#8217;t have to be.</p>
<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s what they are really learning by doing these little &#8220;gotcha&#8221; experiments.</p>

<p>David Allen, best-selling author of Getting Things Done, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/david-allen-on-getting-things-done">tells us how to get more done</a>.<br />
Buzz Bruggeman, CEO of ActiveWords, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/managing-your-mind-with-ceo-activewords">shows me how to use Mind Mapping software and tons of other tools to become more productive</a>.<br />
Philip J. Kuekes, computer architect on the quantum science research team at HP Labs <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/finding-new-memory-structures-hp-labs">shows me how they are finding new ways to make processors and memory a lot smaller and power efficient</a>. Does he make you feel like you are a few brain cells down on him? I always get inspired and wish I studied more math and science in school when I meet guys like Philip.<br />
<a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/senator-tom-coburn-tells-me-why-he-likes-bloggers">Senator Tom Coburn tells me why he likes bloggers</a>, among other things. This was part of our whirl-wind tour of Washington DC.<br />
Microsoft Senior Vice President, Chris Capossela, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/taking-microsoft-office-online">tells me how they are going to keep all office workers from going to Zoho or Google Docs and Spreadsheets</a>. Seriously, he laid out what Microsoft Office team is trying to do to bring collaborative features into the most-used of Office suites.<br />
<a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/talking-child-protection-issues-with-fcc-commissioner">FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein talks to me about a variety of issues</a>, including child protection, which is what he&#8217;s most passionate about.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Every morning now I start out by reading FriendFeed. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/e65f7ef2-ca70-5408-5fa3-5fdac947a43e/The-Web-s-Dirty-Little-Secret/">This morning there was a post by Steve Spalding called &#8220;the Web&#8217;s dirty little secret&#8221;</a> which is about how small the audiences are here in the tech blogging world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/05/21/NoteToWeb20CompaniesEarlyAdoptersAreNotTheMassMarket.aspx">Back in May Dare Obasanjo wrote a post</a> about early adopters and how software developers should discount them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of thinking about both of these things. How can entrepreneurs reach both passionate and non-passionate audiences? Do both matter? When? (Clearly crossing the chasm requires going from the passionates to the non-passionates, or the early adopters to the late ones, if you would rather use that lingo).</p>
<p><strong>So, what&#8217;s this talk about passionates vs. non-passionates?</strong></p>
<p>Well, one thing I&#8217;ve learned over and over is that you can build an interesting business if you have 100,000 people passionate about something. Anything. I used to be an associate editor at a magazine about Visual Basic back in the 1990s. We had millions of dollars in revenue and our distribution was 110,000 copies. That launched conferences and all sorts of things that made money and brought in revenue. Life was good for a while.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you pick a business model that requires huge numbers of people, like Facebook advertising that might only pay $.25 per 1,000 views, then you gotta go big or go home. How do you do that, though? I wish I knew, cause most companies who try doing that go under before they can acquire enough customers. Passionate users are easier to get than non-passionate ones. It&#8217;s why Amazon and Google don&#8217;t do much advertising. Reaching the non-passionates is very hard and they&#8217;ve decided to just invest in making a better product, reaching through the passionates to the larger audience. Other companies, though, feel they can convince the non-passionates and advertise heavily. Lifelock is a good example of that. Lifelock isn&#8217;t something I ever see bloggers or Twitterers talking about, but the company is constantly advertising that product and, from what I hear, raking in big revenues.</p>
<p>Same happens on the Web. People who can build audiences of the 100,000 size can build decent businesses on the Web. Just talk to Gary Vaynerchuk, who does <a href="http://www.winelibrary.tv">WineLibrary.tv</a>. He has audiences of 60,000 to 100,000 watching each show.</p>
<p>Getting to 100,000 engaged users is reasonably easy to do pretty quickly. But the VCs are needing companies that have 10s of millions. iLike, in Seattle, for instance, is touted by Facebook as one of their favorite applications, which got to 30 million users in a very short time. I remember meeting founder Hadi Partovi shortly after they started right around the time I left Microsoft and they didn&#8217;t have a single user. How did they get so big so fast? They had a great app that was out on the first day of Facebook&#8217;s new app platform launch (took many sleepless nights to develop that app and then keep it up as it got to six million users in the first few weeks after launch).</p>
<p>Even with iLike, though, I bet that most of its users are passionate about music. 30 million users is a drop in the bucket compared to people who listen to music around the world. Convincing non-passionate users to try something is really difficult.</p>
<p>Some things that I&#8217;ve noticed about late adopters (er, non-passionates) and how they use computers they really are much different than the passionates who I usually hang out with. They really don&#8217;t care about 99% of the things I care about. FriendFeed? Yeah, right, they haven&#8217;t even heard of it, and if I try telling them about it, they say &#8220;why would I do that?&#8221; See, most people just want to work their 9 to 5 jobs, go home, pop open a beer, sit on the couch, watch some movies, play with their kids, etc.</p>
<p>Stay up all night talking to strangers? No way, no how. Most of the non-passionates I know are just barely trying out Facebook (90 million users). Twitter? Yeah, right. (Two million).</p>
<p>Heck, these people don&#8217;t even know how to use an address bar in a browser. Think I&#8217;m kidding? I&#8217;ve watched how normal people (er, non-passionates) use computers. You go to a search box, and type &#8220;Yahoo&#8221; even if you are already on Yahoo. Think I&#8217;m kidding? Ask the engineers over at Yahoo how many times a day people search for Yahoo on Yahoo&#8217;s own search engine. Same over at Google.</p>
<p>When I travel, I look at what people use &#8212; thanks to being on planes a lot in the past few months I get to see what people use. Most are using technology I used back in 2000. That&#8217;s eight years ago, or 100 in Internet years. I look at them the same way you&#8217;d look at them if they told you they just started using a telephone.</p>
<p>The exception? Blackberry. But show me a Blackberry user that knows how to look up Google Maps or uses the Web more than once a week? I&#8217;ll show you a passionate. I&#8217;ve talked to hundreds of people in airports and I haven&#8217;t found a Web-using Blackberry user yet that&#8217;s not a passionate (meaning, someone who is really passionate about technology).</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the fact that of the six to seven billion people in the world only about a billion even have a computer in the first place. So, that means that five to six billion people really don&#8217;t care about Windows or OSX or all that.</p>
<p>We can be so arrogant sometimes to forget that there are more people who are NOT like us, than who are like us in the technology world.</p>
<p>That said, is Dare Obasanjo correct? Should new companies ignore early adopters?</p>
<p>No, and no.</p>
<p>If Bill Gates had done that Dare would not be working at Microsoft today. Microsoft TOTALLY served the passionates for the first decade of life. Heck, its first product was a compiler!</p>
<p>Early adopters are the ones who will adopt your product or service without you spending hundreds of dollars to get them to try it.</p>
<p>A Kraft food executive once told me they spend about $40 just to get a new customer. Think about that. For FOOD!!! Something that we all need to survive!!!</p>
<p>So, if you want to build a profitable business with very few resources you MUST forget about the non-passionates. They won&#8217;t adopt your product unless you are lucky enough to be something like iLike. And even then your chances are pretty slim. I remember when Buzz Bruggeman, CEO of ActiveWords, had a great review in USA Today and only got 40 downloads of his product. You think their ads are going to work any better? No, and no and no. Give it up, the non-passionates will probably never adopt your product and if you get them, it&#8217;s probably through some very good luck (iLike couldn&#8217;t happen if it were launched today, they needed the Facebook paradigm shift to happen for them to be successful).</p>
<p>So, where do we go from here? I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m doing a lot of work to find out how the tech industry can reach more of the non-passionates. There aren&#8217;t a lot of easy answers.</p>
<p>Some tips for getting seen by more people, passionate OR non-passionate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Believe it or not, Valleywag has a great one. <a href="http://valleywag.com/5030221/want-more-traffic--throw-your-widgets-overboard">Make your page load faster</a>! It&#8217;s amazing to me when I find a blog that doesn&#8217;t load fast.</li>
<li>Make it work great on mobile phones. So many blogs load slow on even my new 3G iPhone. Mashable, I&#8217;m looking at you.</li>
<li>Get more celebrities that the non-passionates care about to use our technology. I remember when one of MySpace&#8217;s founders told me that&#8217;s how they got to be the biggest social network in the world. They got musicians and others in Los Angeles to use their service. That led to the non-passionates joining up (my brother&#8217;s bar is on MySpace and he&#8217;s definitely a non-passionate). Kyte.tv&#8217;s CEO tells me that getting <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/channels/browse.html#mode=WATCHED,uri=channels/18531">50 Cent to use his product</a> was a sizeable breakthrough.</li>
<li>Make your blog easier to find by Google. Normal, non-passionate users use search engines (mostly Google, according to my friends who study such things). <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS279US280&amp;q=Blog+commenting+systems&amp;btnG=Search">Here, do a search for &#8220;blog commenting systems.&#8221;</a> Why does Disqus come up first? Why isn&#8217;t JS-Kit or Intense Debate even on the home page? (Other than in a TechCrunch article?) If we want to grow our audiences we&#8217;ve got to be better about appearing in Google.</li>
<li>Write more well-thought-out posts. My traffic has been going up in the past few weeks because I started writing longer posts, again, and getting off of the PR treadmill of trying to just cover every PR story out there. Louis Gray is seeing the same trends, because he&#8217;s been doing longer &#8220;thought pieces&#8221; instead of just writing about the latest shiny object.</li>
<li>Get the advice of other people who have large audiences. This was Tim Ferriss&#8217; advice after our cameras were off when he was on WorkFast.TV recently &#8212; he wrote the <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/">Four Hour Workweek</a>. He said to look at last year&#8217;s hit book author and call them up (if they are hot right now they probably won&#8217;t have time to talk with you in depth, he said).</li>
<li>Carry a video camera everywhere to get those cool little stories. Why? <a href="http://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/roll/2008/07/its-not-the-camera-its-the-jou.html">Check out this story from the Knoxville News Sentinel</a>.</li>
<li>Register your blog on FriendFeed. Many bloggers are noticing they are getting pretty sizeable traffic from FriendFeed. Why? Because that&#8217;s where a lot of passionates are now spending their time and they are the ones who are likely toclick on links, try things out, talk about them with other people, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>What am I doing? Well, I&#8217;m trying to point my camera at people outside of the tech world, but who are influencers in their own circles. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/the-twittering-congressman">Like today&#8217;s video of Tim Ryan, congressman, who also Twitters</a>. As everyday people hear more stories about how the new technology is being used by innovators, they are much more likely to try it out themselves.</p>
<p>So, how are you getting non-passionates to try your stuff out? What is working out there? Do you even care? Or do you care more about reaching passionates? And, if so, what&#8217;s working for you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Tonight a new search engine showed up. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/27/cuill-launches-a-massive-search-engine/">Techcrunch has the details</a>. So do tons of other blogs. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/080728-000100.php">Search engine guru Danny Sullivan has a great post</a> about the new engine, <a href="http://www.cuil.com/">Cuil</a>, (pronounced &#8220;cool&#8221;). I wasn&#8217;t pre-briefed or anything. Like I said last week I&#8217;m trying to get out of the PR game and try to get back to what made me like blogging: sharing information with other users.</p>
<p>So, has anyone figured out a good way to quickly test search engines? I haven&#8217;t. Everyone has their own search terms that they use to judge whether or not an engine is interesting.</p>
<p>I remember when I was trying to convince my dad to move from Alta Vista to Google he had a bunch of very specific scientific searches he&#8217;d do. He used to love showing me that Alta Vista had more and better results. I kept at it. After about two years he switched to Google too.</p>
<p>Today isn&#8217;t like back in the Alta Vista days. Back then there was porn and spam that was showing up in my result sets. Google doesn&#8217;t have those problems and usually works for almost anything I search for. When it doesn&#8217;t work, I try some of the other engines, or just refactor my search and it almost always works. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I was totally stymied by Google.</p>
<p>But, what&#8217;s great about the blogosphere is that everyone gets to participate. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/27/google-beats-cuil-hands-down-in-size-and-relevance-but-that-isnt-the-whole-story/">Look at TechCrunch&#8217;s early searches</a> and the comments that are coming in. I, too, think that Cuil is going to face an uphill battle based on my early searches.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let&#8217;s give Cuil the benefit of the doubt. Let&#8217;s say it actually was a better search engine. I still doubt many people would switch. Why?</p>
<p>Distribution.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Well, my Firefox browser has Google built into it. Most people have no idea how to switch it. Most people, on our tests, really don&#8217;t understand much of anything except that that little box probably now goes to Google. The Google.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so pervasive of an expectation at this point that many people type URLs into that box. Or, type the word &#8220;Yahoo&#8221; into that box so they can get to their email and other Yahoo services.</p>
<p>Is Cuil going to be able to get into this game?</p>
<p>No way, no how.</p>
<p>On mobile phones it&#8217;s worse. My iPhone has Google built in. No way that Cuil is going to be able to rip out Google and replace that with its own engine.</p>
<p>So, why is Cuil here?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a play for Microsoft money. Microsoft needs to get back into the search game, so will continue buying companies to try to get back into the search game. Yahoo, if run by management that&#8217;s rational, will probably start doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Look at Powerset. They cashed out early to Microsoft. Cuil probably will do the same thing if it brings enough to the table.</p>
<p>Just for fun, though, and to get back to being a user, let&#8217;s try one search:</p>
<p>Barack Obama&#8217;s technology policy</p>
<p>I put that into all the search engines without any quotes, just to see which one does the best job. Here&#8217;s the result set:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cuil.com/search?q=Barack%20Obama%27s%20technology%20policy&amp;sl=long">Cuil </a>(gave an error, couldn&#8217;t find any results)<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Barack+Obama%27s+technology+policy&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google</a>. (best of the three)<br />
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Barack+Obama%27s+technology+policy&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8">Yahoo</a>. (close to Google, but not quite there)<br />
<a href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=Barack+Obama%27s+technology+policy&amp;go=&amp;form=QBLH">Microsoft</a>. (by far the worst of the big three, didn&#8217;t bring the technology policy up as the first result).</p>
<p>Anyway, I did a bunch of other searches on Cuil and they are trying to be different, that&#8217;s for sure, but I didn&#8217;t see enough of a need to try it out further.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>At last week&#8217;s Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference I was on a blogger panel where some members of the audience brought up ye olde &#8220;bloggers aren&#8217;t as good as &#8216;real journalists&#8217; because bloggers don&#8217;t get it right&#8221; argument. The audience cheered when the host made the point that magazine journalists go slower to &#8220;get it right.&#8221; I played the part of the blogger and took the point on the chin, despite also now writing for a magazine and having to work with the old-school editing system of fact-checkers and pre-publication editing.</p>
<p>I tried to make the point that blogs self correct very quickly (usually within hours) because if I get it wrong the people who actually know the truth will jump on me fast and furiously and that blogs arrive at the truth faster BECAUSE of the participation of everyone involved.</p>
<p>This is something that RARELY happens in the paper press. Or, if it does, thanks to letters to the editors, it happens very slowly, so readers never really see that feedback until weeks or months later. And even when it does happen you only see a sample of the feedback, never the whole feedback. In every case gatekeepers are in charge of what the reader sees (try to get something published in a newspaper sometime, even if you have a legitimate case it&#8217;s pretty difficult).</p>
<p>Dave Winer told me often that he loves blogging because it lets him tell his story. His complete, unedited, unchanged, unfiltered story. He&#8217;d tell me example after example of getting interviewed by journalists who didn&#8217;t understand the technology he was building, so they&#8217;d misrepresent it due to either misunderstanding what he was saying, or, even worse, some sort of bias toward him or his technology. Many other people have told me the same thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, at the Fortune thing I tried to get across that I liked having my readers as fact checkers a lot more than the magazine style of working to get it right before publishing. Every column I publish in Fast Company magazine gets edited and fact checked by someone else. That&#8217;s cool and usually keeps me from looking like an idiot in print. But I much prefer the blog because I think the comments are actually part of the article.</p>
<p>No better way to demonstrate that as with yesterday&#8217;s post about Silicon Valley&#8217;s VC Disease.</p>
<p>David Hornik, the VC I was talking about, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/07/26/the-silicon-valley-vc-disease/#comment-1992142">gave a very long reply to my post yesterday</a>. He refuted some things, clarified other things, and had fun with other things. Among the points that Hornik made is that August Capital was one of the few original investors in Seagate. I should have looked that up before publishing. A fact-checker at the magazine probably would have caught it and kept me from looking stupid. But, this let David get a great point across: that he was positioned unfairly by me and let him clarify his remarks on Friday. In the old world a journalist would have been able to throw David under the bus and David wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do much about it except write a letter to the editor.</p>
<p>In the old world of publishing you never would have seen his reply and if, for some reason, it would have run, it would have been a month later separate from the article, not combined with the article within a few hours of its publishing, like Hornik&#8217;s comment was here.</p>
<p>Journalists who fight this system (and readers who don&#8217;t check out the comments) are missing the point. This is a participatory media, not a one-way one, and, while it has a different editing system (the editing is done post publishing, not pre publishing) it&#8217;s pretty clear to me that this system arrives at the truth a lot faster than anything on paper does.</p>
<p>But, you gotta read and participate in those comments! Lots of old-schoolers don&#8217;t like that dirty work.</p>
<p>Oh, and David also <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/7ebe4a62-d238-508d-bb02-8929b21583b4/The-Silicon-Valley-VC-Disease/">joined in over on the FriendFeed thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you David for providing evidence that blogs can make everyone, including the author, smarter.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/mobile-web-wars-live-stream/">Yesterday at the Mobile Web Wars event (here&#8217;s video of that)</a>, held right before the TechCrunch party, David Hornik, partner at August Capital (he&#8217;s the host of the TechCrunch party) told the audience that he would not invest in pure iPhone apps because the iPhone had too small a market share and that anyone who wanted to get big in the mobile space should go after all phones, not just the iPhone, which, while it&#8217;s hot with early-adopter types and is seeing people waiting in lines to buy around the world, hasn&#8217;t yet made a dent in, say, Nokia&#8217;s market share of cell phones overall.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call this the Silicon Valley VC Disease. This disease has been going on for a long time. Seagate&#8217;s CEO Bill Watkins told me a few months ago that Seagate almost didn&#8217;t get started because they couldn&#8217;t get funding from VCs who didn&#8217;t see a potential market for hard drives. UPDATE: See the comments below where I learned that August Capital is one of those who funded Seagate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a corrosive disease, too, and is why we get tons of stupid Facebook apps and tons of easy-to-make and likely-to-go-viral iPhone apps. Quick: explain why we don&#8217;t yet have a really brilliant travel app or even a single political app for the iPhone, despite lots of interest in those topics (especially in this political year). Not to mention many brilliant apps like Evernote (my favorite app so far)?</p>
<p>What is the disease? That you must make bucketloads of money (or at least have a shot at doing that) in the first two years of business.</p>
<p>If you have a plan to make just a reasonable amount of money, or if it will take decades to make a big amount of money, don&#8217;t come to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Walmart would NEVER have gotten funded by Sand Hill Road. It took decades to make bucketloads of money. That kind of business plan would never fit in here.</p>
<p>Why? We have the Silicon Valley VC disease.</p>
<p>I imagine that if we went back in time to 1977. Imagine a small group of geeks wanted to get funding to build apps for the Apple II. It didn&#8217;t have much market share yet. But imagine those developers wanted to build just Apple II apps. Would they have gotten funded? Probably not. And types like David Hornick would have told them &#8220;you gotta build apps for mainframes and DEC&#8217;s, because that&#8217;s where the market is, not in that Apple II toy.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, is Hornik wrong? No, he&#8217;s exactly right. The much bigger market is with regular-old-single-chip-cell phones. You know the type. They are the kinds of phones that make phone calls and maybe do SMS texting. If they have a Web browser it&#8217;s a small tiny black and white one that can only look at WAP-style text-centric sites, not the full-blown Web that the iPhone has.</p>
<p>But while Hornik is right, he also has the Silicon Valley Disease. He forgets that the small, seemingly unimportant platform today that gets early adopters excited will become the large, dominant platform of tomorrow. It might take 10 years, though, which is too long for VCs to care about. How long did it take Visicalc to happen on the Apple II? Or Aldus Pagemaker to happen on the Mac? A few years at minimum. iPhone is only one year old.</p>
<p>But already we&#8217;re seeing the writing on the wall. If you can get past your Silicon Valley VC Disease.</p>
<p>First, our society&#8217;s most valuable audiences are getting iPhones. Last week when I was in Los Angeles, both of the famous architects I interviewed already had 3G iPhones.</p>
<p>Those two guys are HUGELY valuable for advertisers. They are representative. They aren&#8217;t the only ones.</p>
<p>But even better than the demographics that the iPhone is getting is the usage patterns.</p>
<p>See, I have two Nokia phones and a Microsoft Windows Mobile phone too. They all suck for using the Web. Fine for email and for texting, but really suck for using the Web.</p>
<p>Go see Google&#8217;s Vic Gundotra (he&#8217;s Vice President and runs a bunch of the teams that build things for mobile phones). He told me that usage on the iPhone is &#8220;off the scale&#8221; when compared to other phones.</p>
<p>Simply translated: people who have non-iPhone phones simply aren&#8217;t using them for anything other than email. This is easily verified. Sit next to a Blackberry user and watch what they do. I do that all the time. All you see them doing is email and light Web use. Now sit next to an iPhone user and watch what they do. Much more heavily used on photos, maps, Web, and video.</p>
<p>An iPhone user is easier to reach and is easier to get to try new things. Plus, the iPhone app store makes it very easy for an app to be tried out and loaded.</p>
<p>But back to the Silicon Valley VC disease. It&#8217;s the same disease that Microsoft execs have. Or, really, most big company execs, or worse yet, our government workers, have truth be told.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t adopt anything until &#8220;it&#8217;s safe&#8221; and until there&#8217;s a HUGE business reason to do it. It&#8217;s why huge parts of our government are still run on paper. Why there isn&#8217;t a database anywhere of all of our elected officials in the United States. Why Microsoft didn&#8217;t compete with Google until too late. Why General Motors won&#8217;t build great all-electric cars until after Tesla or Toyota beats them to the punch. Etc. Etc.</p>
<p>Luckily the Silicon Valley VC Disease is having less and less effect lately.</p>
<p>You can startup a company with very little cash, because you can build it on cloud-based services like Amazon&#8217;s S3, which let you get started and show the world you&#8217;re getting adoption even before you go for VC money.</p>
<p>And, luckily, not every VC has the Silicon Valley VC Disease. Lots invest in stupid, small, weird, ideas for platforms that only have a percent or two of market share. Go see Jeff Clavier, for instance. He&#8217;s been doing that a lot lately. <a href="http://qik.com/video/129890">I met him in the office of Tapulous last week</a>, which makes iPhone apps.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t you listen to Hornik and others who have Silicon Valley VC disease?</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s easier to start a company on new platforms. Why? Because the big money probably hasn&#8217;t moved in yet, or at least they haven&#8217;t become established.</li>
<li>People who buy new things are FAR EASIER to convince to buy other new things than people who have had the same stuff for years.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easier to build a brand on a new technology than it is to do that on an older, more established one (hey, everyone has a radio in their cars, but you don&#8217;t see VC&#8217;s funding new radio stations, do you? Why is that?)</li>
<li>The best, most transactional and monetizeable audiences are those that pick up new things. Think about it, would you rather have a customer like Dan Meis, one of the world&#8217;s best architects or someone like my dad who still uses the same TV that he bought from me in the mid-1980s?  My dad is a nice guy and very smart, but he&#8217;s a horrible customer to have and is going to be very expensive to get to adopt something new.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a lot cheaper to get adoption when influencers (read bloggers and journalists and Twitterers and FriendFeeders) are talking about you. What are they talking about right now? iPhone apps. <a href="http://search.twitter.com/">Look at Summize, the search engine Twitter just bought</a>. What&#8217;s one of the trending topics on the home page? iPhone. Get over it. They ain&#8217;t talking about Nokia or Microsoft.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I just find it interesting when VCs start telling people not to support a platform when there&#8217;s lines around the world waiting to buy that platform. If everyone listened to that sentiment we&#8217;d never see any innovation in the world.</p>
<p>So, who is working to prove Hornik wrong? Drop me a line.</p>
<p>Oh, and David&#8217;s a nice guy and throws great parties. Thanks David for letting me in last night and for giving me something interesting to blog about today. :-)</p>
<p>UPDATE: As usual lately <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/7ebe4a62-d238-508d-bb02-8929b21583b4/The-Silicon-Valley-VC-Disease/">a much more interesting conversation about this post is happening over on FriendFeed</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a title="My STM Computer Bag by Robert Scoble, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer/2697622896/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/2697622896_3c66e3bcf6_m.jpg" alt="My STM Computer Bag" width="180" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>It has rolled over the sands of Israel. Kept my computer dry in the middle of a New York downpour. Been dragged through more than three miles of the snows and mud of Davos, Switzerland. Held my laptop and a loaf of bread in Paris, France. Kept my computers safe in the Red-Light District of Amsterdam, has visited many other cities and countries around the world. Been to dozens of airports and overhead bins. Its wheels have seen so many miles that they have been noticeably worn down.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been dropped out of the back of a van, been kicked many times loading into planes and other places, squished by all our other camera gear at times, and suffered a lot more in cities around the world.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s not a stitch missing. It is simply the best computer bag I&#8217;ve ever owned.</p>
<p>What is it? <a href="http://www.stmbags.com.au/journey-specifications.php">A STM Journey bag</a>. Why don&#8217;t I carry a backpack or a single-strap shoulder bag?</p>
<p>Because I have a bad back and want to keep extra weight off of my back, especially in long walks like the one I took with Mark Zuckerberg back in January through the town of Davos.</p>
<p>Yes, I always look like a tourist. People ask me all the time if I&#8217;m going somewhere. I explain why I use a bag that looks like carry-on luggage. It saves my back.</p>
<p>Wheels are one of man&#8217;s greatest inventions and because I rarely lift my bag off of the ground I am just fine with packing it full of digital camera gear, extra batteries, and sometimes two laptops, along with tons of cell phone gear.</p>
<p>I love my bag and won&#8217;t easily give it up. I wish all my gear took so much abuse in stride.</p>
<p>What is your favorite computer bag?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>&#8220;It has got dummied down,&#8221; musician Neil Young just told the audience. He is trying to get us all to pressure Apple and the PC industry to give us much better quality. </p>
<p>He chastised us all for not talking about the quality of music and not asking the industry for better quality. He says that if the industry included better digital to analog converters in their boxes he could deliver to all of us a much better experience.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you like better quality music or do you think MP3 is good enough?</p>
<p>Why is this my favorite talk? Because it is one that put forth a very simple proposal to make all of our lives better.</p>
<p>He says that Apple is holding back the ability to give us all the ability to listen to &#8220;high-res&#8221; music that has four times the data of MP3&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Oh, and now he is talking about his ideas of how to get us better car technology. He is a geek. Love it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>You might know that Facebook, this afternoon, will have its second press conference surrounding its platform. Go to <a href="http://www.techmeme.com">TechMeme</a> if you want to know the news. I&#8217;m sure there will be dozens of articles. I decided I would go, though, mostly to find smaller stories about what developers are doing on that platform. Talk to you later.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the continuing feedback about the rant I wrote the other night. It&#8217;s really hard to get off of the &#8220;write about the latest shiny object&#8221; game. I think I need to go to a detox program for tech bloggers. :-)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I am sitting at lunch sitting next to Adobe&#8217;s CTO typing to you from my iPhone with the just-released WordPress iPhone application. Very nice but I don&#8217;t see a way to read, review, moderate comments. That is the functionality I really need when I am mobile. I would also love to be able to post a picture and comment on it. Anyway, enjoying getting more of my life onto my mobile even if it shows how far we have to go. Kick me if I get too exuberant about iPhone apps, they are the fun &#8220;shiny object&#8221; of the moment.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m off to attend <a href="http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/conferences/brainstormtech/tech_home.html">the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference</a> today, will try to bring you some new tech out of that.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re near Half Moon Bay today, drop on by the Ritz at 5:45 p.m. &#8212; we&#8217;re having an open-to-the-public &#8220;Tweetup&#8221; at the Fire Ring in back by the ocean. Remember to bring $10 for parking.</p>
<p>Thanks for the comments, will try to keep it real.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Oh, what a hoot. I&#8217;ve been taking a break from blogging just to relax and invest my time in other places. Like <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com/scobleizer">FriendFeed</a>. Or downloading iPhone apps.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about Tech blogging and my role in it. I&#8217;ve increasingly become saddened. Why? Because we&#8217;ve increasingly started focusing on the business side of things. Look at all the stories on <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">TechMeme </a>or <a href="http://news.google.com/?topic=t">Google News&#8217; tech section</a>. It&#8217;s all business, almost all the time.</p>
<p>Rewriting (or competing with) the Wall Street Journal isn&#8217;t why I started blogging back in 2000. I started blogging because I wanted to share my life with you (back then I was planning conferences with programmers and I was seeing them build remarkable things). I wanted to help other people discover these new things and understand how to use them best.</p>
<p>I really got back to those early days when I visited <a href="http://www.meisarchitects.com/">Dan Meis</a>. He&#8217;s an architect. No, dummy, not a software architect, but an architect that designs REAL buildings! (He designed Seattle&#8217;s baseball stadium, for instance). After the interview he pulled out his new iPhone and we were comparing apps. I showed him a few, and life was, for a few seconds, just two geeks sharing what we loved.</p>
<p>That feeling came back yesterday during lunch. I was sitting with <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/about/bios/stanwilliams.html">Stanley Williams, Senior HP Fellow</a>, and listened to him talk about all sorts of Quantum Science Research that HP was doing with <a href="http://www.dfj.com/team/steve_bio.shtml">Steve Jurvetson, managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson</a>, a famous VC firm in the valley. These two instantly started talking about stuff that made me realize (and everyone sitting next to me) that I know absolutely nothing about anything. They were using a language I didn&#8217;t understand talking about how HP was going to shrink processors to many times smaller than they are today.</p>
<p>Later in the evening I felt that feeling once again when I met Jim Robinson who was American Express&#8217;s CEO for many years (and is still on the board at CocaCola). I had no idea who he was, but I instantly saw in his eyes that he was someone who, even at more than 70 years old, still loved to learn new things. I, of course, pulled out my iPhone and took a picture of his badge with Evernote (and one of his business card) which I then showed him that Evernote uploaded it to the cloud and made it searchable on the text on both of those things. Standing next to him was Brad Smith, CEO of Intuit. He immediately wrote down the name of the app I was using. The joy of tech blogging returned to my face (albeit it was a conversation that didn&#8217;t have an audience).</p>
<p>I realized this was what early blogging was all about. It&#8217;s why I was the first one to link to TechCrunch (ask Mike Arrington about that). It&#8217;s why I loved hanging out with Dave Winer &#8212; he showed me all sorts of weird ways to use RSS and blogging software and, later, how to do cool things with home audio gear.</p>
<p>Later I was on a panel where the talk turned to Yahoo and the business deals it may or may not find itself in. I thought to myself (and probably said out loud) that we had wasted 10 minutes of our lives talking about such things.</p>
<p>I realized that I&#8217;m at fault for some of why tech blogging has failed you and was thinking that I&#8217;d done too much of the &#8220;business talk&#8221; and not enough of the &#8220;let&#8217;s discover something that&#8217;ll improve our lives together&#8221; talk. </p>
<p>But there&#8217;s other things too, that have been bugging me.</p>
<p>Tech blogging has become way too controlled by PR agents. You might not realize it, but the top blogs are contacted by PR folks dozens of times per day. This is why you&#8217;ll see 15 stories all appear on Techmeme at the same time. All with the same news. Only a few of whom slow down to ask &#8220;is this really useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>See, we&#8217;ve all learned that getting out in the first two minutes is worth a lot of traffic. Particularly if you are writing about an Apple news release. </p>
<p>Watch on Wednesday afternoon as the press, er bloggers, all file the same news story, albeit each with a different sensationalized headline. I&#8217;ve played that game and done it as well as anyone.</p>
<p>If you decide not to play that game then you stop getting invited to the coolest events. It&#8217;s how the game is played and it ensures that the bloggers all turn into a bunch of news junkies who love talking about the latest Yahoo rumors.</p>
<p>Tonight during the panel Adam Lashinsky of Fortune Magazine made fun of the bloggers saying that in the old school they slow down to make sure they get it right. Whether or not that was a correct statement, it did sit true with me. Few people in the tech blogs call me to get my side of the story when my name is involved. And my phone number is on the blog. If they don&#8217;t call me, I seriously doubt they call to check facts or do real reporting with anyone else.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m definitely looking in the mirror there, buddy.</p>
<p>So, off I go to FriendFeed and Twitter where there are real people who don&#8217;t care about the business but who are just looking to use technology to have more fun, be more productive, or do something more interesting with their lives.</p>
<p>More ways we&#8217;ve failed you?</p>
<p>Our commenting systems really suck. I didn&#8217;t realize just how badly they sucked until I started using FriendFeed. My comments here are gummed up with moderation, with spam filters that only sorta work, that don&#8217;t have threading, and have many other problems ranging from needing to be signed into, to not working on mobile devices very well, to requiring you to enter weird numbers or do math just to be able to post a comment.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Only the most motivated will leave comments. That&#8217;s usually someone with an axe to grind. I&#8217;m so tired of those kinds of conversations &#8220;Scoble, you&#8217;re an idiot.&#8221; Hey, I already know that, remember my conversation with Jurvetson and Williams? Why can&#8217;t commenters be nice, the way they probably would be if they were face to face? That&#8217;s cause we&#8217;ve failed you. We haven&#8217;t moderated jerks out of our commenting system so now no normal person would go close to anything resembling a modern commenting system. Worse, go over to Digg, which used to be one of my favorite places to find new and interesting stories. The comments over there are simply disgusting cesspools of 14-year-olds who are testing their boundaries when mommy and daddy aren&#8217;t looking. Even my 14-year-old son avoids that.</p>
<p>Ahh, <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/07/20/a-cure-for-curmudgeons/">Jeff Jarvis has a cure for these curmudgeons</a>. Me? I&#8217;ve just been deleting and blocking jerks out of my life. I don&#8217;t need them and they don&#8217;t need me.</p>
<p>How else do we fail you?</p>
<p>We focus on the latest, shiny object and don&#8217;t follow up. I see a few signs that&#8217;s changing, but it&#8217;s really hard to stay interested in stuff. I was talking with someone tonight who said Facebook seems to be fading from interest. I say they should go to Israel, like I did, or ask my wife. She&#8217;s thrilled with Facebook and keeps checking her wall. Me? Meh, off to the newest shiny thing. Oh, wait, Facebook is announcing something new on Wednesday? Oh, wait, Facebook has a new UI? Heck yeah, we&#8217;ll check that out for a few minutes tonight and write a bunch about it. Then we&#8217;ll forget it in two more weeks and, probably worse, bitterly deride it for all its many flaws (there are always flaws that you find a few weeks after the press releases are gone and the PR teams have moved on).</p>
<p>How else do we fail you?</p>
<p>We used to link to each other all the time, telling you when all the other cool bloggers have done something new and useful. Now? The top tier of bloggers that you are probably following are too busy to respond to their own inbound email (I&#8217;m not alone in that one) not to mention have time to read feeds from, gasp, other people&#8217;s blogs. If you&#8217;re lucky we&#8217;ll check Techmeme once in a while and might whip up a post based on that, which leads to even more groupthink.</p>
<p>Yet another way we fail you?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s simply too much content to read and watch. So, many of you just avoid us all together. Actually, this is why I like FriendFeed, but why it&#8217;s a flawed product right now. On FriendFeed we can vote on which stories are interesting. That&#8217;s what the &#8220;Like&#8221; link is for. But the problem is we can&#8217;t display all FriendFeed items that only have a certain number of likes. Until the database lets us do that, this is a problem that remains.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to solve it. Digg is one answer, but is flawed due to group bias and horrid comments. Having a set of professional editors, is another way, but really, isn&#8217;t that the same thing <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/likes">as looking at all the items I&#8217;ve &#8220;liked&#8221; on FriendFeed</a>? That&#8217;s pretty cool, but has its own bias. And, anyway, on a slow news day, like today, you won&#8217;t see much meat there. Heck, looking at that page I &#8220;like&#8221; way too many items, many of which look pretty stupid once you look back on them.</p>
<p>Some other ways we fail you?</p>
<p>Ethics? I have seen some bloggers not disclose conflicts of interest. I always will, but not everyone you see on TechMeme lives by the highest of rules.</p>
<p>Design? Sphinn, for instance, doesn&#8217;t give you full text feeds in its RSS feed. For many that&#8217;s not good. Others use too-small fonts to read in a normal browser. Others don&#8217;t work on mobile phones very well.</p>
<p>Many of us can seem out of touch with the real world. Do we write about all the forclosures going on? No, and while we&#8217;re waiting in line for iPhones and buying the latest games, that can seem pretty out of place right now while people are losing their homes or their life savings. </p>
<p>Also, many of us are very pro Apple, yet when I travel around the world I see far fewer Macs than I see when I go to, say, Gnomedex or other technology conferences that have lots of early adopters. So, we start talking about cool stuff that many of our readers don&#8217;t have access to. Or, even worse, when I fly I look at what kind of systems people are using. I still see a ton of Windows 2000 out there. I don&#8217;t know a single tech blogger who still uses Windows 2000. So, we can&#8217;t even relate to what that experience is like anymore, which is why we like writing about Vista vs. OSX.</p>
<p>Finally, I see a lot of blogs that tear down companies, people, or ideas. I remember when the blogs always just were trying to uplift each other and put interesting ideas forward. </p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m rambling. It&#8217;s clear to me that I haven&#8217;t been serving you well over the past few months and I&#8217;m going to be changing my approach to being one that&#8217;s more practical and useful and I&#8217;ll start trying to bring those kinds of things into your view more often. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker </a>kind of stuff, for instance.</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>I would love your help, by the way. What blogs are doing the best tech blogging? Let&#8217;s clean out my Google Reader subscription list and make sure I&#8217;m following the best tech bloggers. Another way you can help? Drop me a line if you see someone doing something really edifying.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>A couple of weeks ago we visited HP Labs where Chandrakant Patel, HP Fellow and Director of HP Labs&#8217; Sustainable IT Ecosystem Laboratory <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/datacenter-future">gave us a tour of the datacenter of the future</a>. This datacenter was actually used to render the first two Shrek movies. Patel has worked at HP for 21 years, and is an interesting guy to have a conversation with.</p>
<p>What makes it futuristic? Because of the sensor grid and the way they can move cool air around the room to more efficiently cool the machines.</p>
<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/674d8451-5a1e-1892-9049-7397e4c3f358/Datacenter-of-the-Future/">See what they are saying about this video over on FriendFeed</a>. Here&#8217;s a taste: &#8220;another excellent interview.&#8221; &#8220;Awesome.&#8221; &#8220;Nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, earlier this week we posted <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/the-guy-building-the-new-hp">the interview with the head of HP Labs, Prith Banerjee</a>. That was filmed in front of David Packard and Bill Hewlett&#8217;s original offices, so you work for HP and have never been to the headquarters, that&#8217;s what they look like.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Today I visited two iPhone developers to see how things went. First we visited Evernote, which makes a great note-taking app. This is the most useful app I&#8217;ve loaded on my iPhone so far (which has more than 30 apps loaded on it). Really killer thing? Take a picture of something with text in it. Say a sign, or a business card. Or a newspaper ad. Or a bill you received. Save it. Then, search for something on that bill. Wow. It turned all the text in the picture into something you could search for. This is the coolest thing.</p>
<p>The second app developer was Tapulous, producers of Tap Tap Revenge, the #1 free game (and was #9 on the overall list when I visited them tonight and they&#8217;ve been rising fast).</p>
<p>Some things I learned.</p>
<p>Evernote has seen 30,000 new people sign up for its service through the iPhone App Store (and many more have downloaded it but had existing accounts). Tap Tap Revenge, which was developed by Nate True, has seen about 200,000 downloads so far, which is made even more incredible because it wasn&#8217;t working for part of the day on Friday due to Apple not letting them onto the list at first.</p>
<p>Tapulous says they have several other apps (including <a href="http://qik.com/video/129909">a Twitter app, called Twinkle, that I got a first look at</a>. That&#8217;s Mike Lee, Chief Architect, showing that off to me) that hasn&#8217;t been approved yet, and they are hoping Apple will approve their apps &#8220;any minute now.&#8221; </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the videos:</p>
<p><a href="http://qik.com/video/129897">Demo of Tap Tap Revenge</a>. In this video you see Bart Decrem, CEO.</p>
<p><a href="http://qik.com/video/129890">Meet Jeff Clavier</a>, one of the investors in Tapulous.</p>
<p><a href="http://qik.com/video/129909">Mike Lee, Chief Architect at Tapulous, shows off Twinkle for the first time</a>, which is a new Twitter client coming soon for the iPhone.</p>
<p>Interview with Evernote&#8217;s CEO, Phil Libin, who <a href="http://qik.com/video/129647">shows me how his app works on the iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>To give you some perspective on how much the world has sped up: in 1996 the hottest app was ICQ, an instant messaging client. The guys who started that company defined viral marketing. In the first six weeks that ICQ was out there they had 65,000 downloads. Tapulous saw that many downloads in less than a day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from other iPhone app developers, particularly ones that are getting praised, or are learning something unique.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m hearing from other developers that getting apps approved by Apple is very difficult. Any tips for getting your apps through the system? Any news from developers so we can figure out how slow Apple is being in getting through the app backlog?</p>

<p>The New York Times, tomorrow, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/washington/13cong.html">has an article about the controversy over using Internet communications tools</a> like Qik and Twitter and whether they should be allowed to be used by members of Congress. Both Qik and Twitter should be thanking Congressman John Culberson (that&#8217;s him, being Qik interviewed by me and Andrew Feinberg). You can <a href="http://twitter.com/johnculberson/">read his Twitter account here</a> and you can <a href="http://qik.com/johnculberson/">watch his Qik videos here</a>. It&#8217;s amazing how this all started when <a href="http://friendfeed.com/agfhome">Andrew Feinberg</a> and I interviewed Culberson just a couple of weeks ago. Andrew broke this story and deserves the credit. </p>
<p><a href="http://qik.com/video/112754">In this Qik video we filmed</a>, you&#8217;ll hear him explain the coming controversy over using video in Congress.</p>
<p>Amazing how these tools are quickly being picked up in all sorts of non-techie places and are causing major controversies.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Andrew <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/c022bbd9-121d-312e-a10c-a68e6e7061f8/Qik-and-Twitter-goes-to-Congress/">linked to more video and other posts on this story on FriendFeed</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080711/p101#a080711p101">Why does stuff like this happen</a>? Blame it on iPhone fever. It&#8217;s a slow news day, other than Apple&#8217;s crap. So, Jason goes out and trolls for attention, the way that only he can do. Brilliant at it, too. Got BusinessWeek&#8217;s Sarah Lacy to bite. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. I really do need to teach you something about Jason, don&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation to take Jason seriously, either, and assume he&#8217;s handing the keys to the blogosphere over to the new guard. Who&#8217;s that? Well, let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://friendfeed.com/louisgray">Louis Gray</a>. He&#8217;s my top most interesting guy according to FriendFeed stats (only TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="http://friendfeed.com/techcrunch">Mike Arrington</a> beats him).</p>
<p>But, seriously. Jason&#8217;s playing all of us. And, anyway, he knows how to get us all to listen to him when he needs that. Blogging no longer is the only tool with which someone like Jason can get us all involved in his drama.</p>
<p>Or, like <a href="http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2008/07/11/jasons-long-goodbye-give-me-a-break/">Mathew Ingram says, &#8220;give me a break.&#8221;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> has been hiring Google&#8217;s superstars. This has got to be worrying for Google.</p>
<p>Who is the latest to get hired? Gary Burd (that&#8217;s him wearing the FriendFeed shirt in the photo above). What did he do before joining FriendFeed? Oh, just some little things. He was the guy who opened Google&#8217;s Kirkland Office. He ran the Google Talk team. Before Google he worked on several key things at Microsoft, including developing the Trident HTML rendering engine, the core rendering component of Internet Explorer 4.</p>
<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/e434a089-0629-4430-b99d-7457454c4e39/Friendfeed-creators-have-learned-a-lot-from/">Over on FriendFeed we discussed</a> some of the other team members (they only have eight employees so far, so haven&#8217;t made a major dent into Google, but they are definitely getting some superstars). Here are the ones I remember:</p>
<p>Bret Taylor. During his four years at Google, he led more than 25 successful product launches, including Google Maps, Google Local, Google Web Toolkit, the Google Maps API, and Google’s Developer product group.</p>
<p>Paul Buchheit? He was the creator and lead developer of Gmail, which anticipated many aspects of Web 2.0, including the idea of Ajax, long before that term was coined. He developed the original prototype of Google AdSense as part of his work on Gmail. He also suggested the company&#8217;s now-famous motto &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; in a 2001 meeting on company values.</p>
<p>Sanjeev Singh is a former Google engineer, playing a role in both Google Mail and Google Search Appliance. Prior to Google Sanjeev worked at social annotations site Third Voice and a government research lab.</p>
<p>Kevin Fox: from 2003 to January 2008, Kevin Fox worked as a user experience designer at Google, designing such products as Gmail, Google Calendar, and the second version of Google Reader.</p>
<p>Tudor Bosman is another. Is a great developer from Google, and was principal member of technical staff at Oracle.</p>
<p>Back at the end of March (shortly after joining FriendFeed) <a href="http://qik.com/video/46046">I interviewed Bret Taylor and Paul Buchheit on my cell phone</a> and later <a href="http://qik.com/video/73962">I interviewed Kevin Fox, designer</a>, who told me a bit about his design philosophy.</p>
<p>This is a superstar team and is the most interesting startup I follow. Do you have any who have more interesting teams than this?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Last year it took two months to get our iPhones all onto AT&amp;T&#8217;s family plan. I visited the AT&amp;T store half a dozen times, spent hours on the phone with them before it was all done properly. I assumed then that it was a problem with Apple and AT&amp;T working together and first-day problems that I forgave.</p>
<p>But, today, our iPhones are again on individual plans (not voluntarily, either) and I was told to visit an AT&amp;T store &#8220;soon&#8221; to get all my accounts onto a family plan. Apple employees tried over and over again to get our phones to join up into a Family Plan, but they couldn&#8217;t make it work, so they gave up and told me to go to an AT&amp;T store. The fun starts over again.</p>
<p>This time I totally blame AT&amp;T for not working with Apple and making sure that the process is much smoother for existing customers. Especially since last year Apple wasn&#8217;t even part of the problem.</p>
<p>So, AT&amp;T, why is it so hard to make it easy to join all your accounts together into a family plan?</p>
<p>Making it worse this year is I have several accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li>My iPhone, which now is a 3G.</li>
<li>My son&#8217;s iPhone, which is now a 3G.</li>
<li>My wife&#8217;s iPhone which will stay an original iPhone.</li>
<li>My Nokia N82 account.</li>
<li>My Nokia N95 account.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I have five accounts using several different kinds of phones, which makes it hard to join them all together.</p>
<p>Anyone else having this problem?</p>
<p>UPDATE: AT&amp;T, over the phone, fixed all of our accounts, so I&#8217;m happy. They don&#8217;t know why the Apple machines weren&#8217;t showing that we were all on a family plan yesterday.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Apple continues to amaze. I&#8217;ve never seen a company <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080711/p60#a080711p60">have a technical meltdown in front of the eyes of the world the way Apple did today</a>. Yet when my son got out of the store after three hours of hell inside the store (we were snuck to the front of the line by someone who gave us cuts so that we could be among the first to get one, <a href="http://qik.com/video/127147">so that we could document what it was like for him to walk into the store</a> and be #1 &#8212; he waited for two days) <a href="http://qik.com/video/127389">he said he still loved Apple and still loved his 3G iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>After playing with it today I&#8217;ve got to agree. This is the company that can give you a crappy camera. No video. Charge you more than other devices. Make you wait hours in line. Take hours to get your credit card approved, <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080711/p60#a080711p60">your iPhones activated</a>. And, at the end of it all, make you feel good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been comparing the iPhone 3G to my Nokia N82 and N95 and my Microsoft Mobile-powered Samsung Blackjack II cell phones and, again, the iPhone kicks ass.</p>
<p>The App Store is simply brilliant. The new things available for the iPhone are just years ahead of other phones. The experience of using an iPhone is just way ahead of even the best Nokia and Microsoft phones (although I met with both companies recently and don&#8217;t expect them to let Apple have all the fun for long).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth the hell. Apple and AT&amp;T will do just fine after fixing all the bugs that caused today&#8217;s debacle.</p>
<p>That said, no other company in the world has so much brand love in reserve that it can get this reaction. Any other company in the world would have seen riots after it took more than an hour to process even a portion of the first group of 20 people to enter the store.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/11/the-great-iphone-3g-ifail-a-retrospective-with-videos/">VentureBeat has the video</a> of the &#8216;iPocolypse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unbelieveable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth the hell.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>First, Microsoft deserves a kudo for its Pro Photo Summit. <a href="http://photobusinessforum.blogspot.com/2008/07/microsoft-pro-photo-summit-2008-recap.html">John Harrington wrote up the highlights and linked to many of the coolest things</a>.</p>
<p>But the coolest thing I saw on Wednesday?</p>
<p>Was something I saw at lunch: <a href="http://www.xrez.com/yose_proj/Yose_index.html">the Yosemite Extreme Gigapixel Panoramic Imaging Project</a>. <a href="http://www.xrez.com/yose_proj/Yose_img1.html">They mapped out Yosemite</a> with 20 high-resolution panoramic cameras. To give you an idea how cool these images are, <a href="http://www.xrez.com/glacier_point_giga.html">here&#8217;s an earlier version they did</a>. The 20 new images should be up on the xRez site this week, they told me.</p>
<p>I liked it so much that I did three videos. If you only have time for one, <a href="http://qik.com/video/125613">watch this 17-minute video</a>, which is the second one below.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://qik.com/video/125418">first video</a> was one I filmed during lunch with Greg Downing and Eric Hanson, co founders of xRez Studios, which did the xRez Yosemite Gigapixel Project. They are the two geeks who built the systems to stitch together these huge images (gigapixels). <a href="http://digitalproducer.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=173174">Digital Producer has an indepth article on the technology</a> they are using.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://qik.com/video/125613">second video</a> and <a href="//qik.com/video/125619">third video</a> I filmed after the summit&#8217;s first day ended and things were a little quieter. This time Bill Crow of Microsoft&#8217;s Live Labs joined us. You can read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/billcrow/">his blog here, which is on HD Photography</a>. These two videos not only give you a good tour around the Yosemite project, which contains some of the highest-resolution images of Yosemite ever seen (so much detail is in them that you can zoom into climbers on the top of Half Dome), but also Bill explains the technology that lets you view and zoom these images over the Internet. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Seadragon&#8221; and it&#8217;s quite remarkable. I wish these videos were a little sharper, but you&#8217;ll get the idea of just how cool this technology is.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thomashawk.com">Thomas Hawk</a> sitting next to Bill Crow.</p>
<p>Oh, and all of this stuff is demoed on Microsoft&#8217;s new Surface table-top computer, which is quite remarkable too. This is the first time I&#8217;ve really gotten a good hands-on look at the Surface and I see a TON of stuff that I liked a lot. I could play with one of those for hours.</p>
<p>Think Microsoft isn&#8217;t innovative? You can&#8217;t say that anymore, sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more example of what Microsoft is doing in photography that just is magical: Microsoft&#8217;s Deep Photo. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dan_fay/archive/2008/07/10/deep-photo-at-ms-pro-photo-summit.aspx">Dan Fay got first video of this new project</a> and it&#8217;s wow. You&#8217;ll hear me in the front row saying &#8220;wow&#8221; when researcher Michael Cohen uses this technology to remove haze from an image of New York City.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I imagine everyone who cares about the new iPhone knows where to find the news, but I imagine there might be one of you who just woke up from a coma, or arrived from Mars, and needs to know what is going on. <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a> has almost wall-to-wall coverage of all the new iPhone stuff.</p>
<p>Me? My 14-year-old son loaded all of our iPhones (we own three) with iPhone 2.0 firmware update. <a href="http://qik.com/video/126451">He also did a little review on Qik for me</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be at the San Francisco Apple store to get the new iPhone. We should arrive at about 6:30 a.m. &#8212; watch Qik for some news and stuff. Or come and join us.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll head over to the Revision 3 studios to film <a href="http://www.workfast.tv">WorkFastTV</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/discussion">One neat thing about being on FriendFeed</a> is that the community gives you a TON of feedback. I&#8217;ve found that the community there is really constructive, even when giving pretty harsh feedback. Anyway, tomorrow on WorkFastTV we&#8217;re making a ton of changes. It&#8217;ll be interesting to watch FriendFeed tomorrow to see what people think of the show, especially since the changes that got done came from there.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow we&#8217;ll have Matt Rissell, CEO of <a href="http://www.tsheets.com/">TSheets</a>, a Boise-based provider of online timeclocks used by employees and consultants. <a href="http://blog.tsheets.com/">Here&#8217;s his blog</a>. All that is pretty cool, but what I found interesting is that he went on a mission to determine what made the most productive people successful and interviewed tons of CEOs. His surprise: Tools didn&#8217;t much matter. His discovery: There are 10 rules that the 75 successful people he surveyed all followed. We&#8217;ll talk about those tomorrow.</p>
<p>I bet that one of them is &#8220;listens well to feedback.&#8221; See you at <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv">FastCompanyTV</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time tomorrow. We won&#8217;t have a chat room during the show (that&#8217;s one of the many changes that we&#8217;re making) but will be interactive after the show. We&#8217;re doing that so we can give our guest our full attention during the show and this way we&#8217;ll be interactive, but at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think.</p>

It&#8217;s DRAMATICALLY easier to use than previous versions, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/underneath-smartsheet">here&#8217;s an interview and demo with the CEO</a>. How did that happen? Well, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/designing-better-experiences-jackson-fish-market">go behind the scenes with the CEO and the design team</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how a service that has no added features can be dramatically different when the user interaction is thought through in a new way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I&#8217;ve sat in tons of audiences at tons of conferences this year. I&#8217;ve noticed a trend that I first noticed at Gnomedex: more and more people are sitting on their computers or Blackberries. Some people have decried this as the inattention of an audience that should be paying attention on stage.</p>
<p>I say that&#8217;s hogwash. If you want us to pay attention do something worthy of paying attention to.</p>
<p>Yesterday I watched as an audience of several hundred put down their Blackberries, turned off Twitter, and became transfixed on what they were hearing. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop almost the entire time.</p>
<p>It was magical. It was an experience I LOVED as an audience member. I didn&#8217;t feel like talking back. The only thing I wanted to do was tell everyone else about it.</p>
<p>What was the talk? By photographer <a href="http://www.lanting.com/">Franz Lanting</a>. He&#8217;s worked for the National Geographic for years, among other projects.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t do it justice in 10,000 words. <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/6118-scobleizer-and-workfasttv-chat/164179-franz-lanting">You&#8217;ve simply got to watch it</a>. It was part of Microsoft&#8217;s Pro Photo Summit that&#8217;s going on now (I filmed most of the first day on <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/scobleizer">my Kyte.tv channel</a>).</p>
<p>Franz is a master story teller. There are very few in the world who are at this level. I&#8217;m simply in awe, even 24 hours later. It&#8217;s unfortunate that I didn&#8217;t have my HD cameras to film this, but since Franz lives a few miles away from me we&#8217;ll definitely go and film him again soon.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>We&#8217;ve all heard about Second Life. I loved it, but it didn&#8217;t &#8220;stick&#8221; for a whole bunch of reasons. Meaning, it didn&#8217;t go mainstream, even though it had a HUGE amount of hype. Why not? Well, it was an island that you had to go into. Problem is, only gamers do that and Second Life wasn&#8217;t enough of a game. World of Warcraft came along and took a lot of the gamers away from it. My son used to be really interested in Second Life and for the past year he&#8217;s been playing World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Another reason? It wasn&#8217;t accessible from the Web. You couldn&#8217;t get into a Second Life scene from a Web site until you downloaded the app, signed up, and all that. Even then it took forever to start up and just wasn&#8217;t a Web-compatible experience.</p>
<p>Another reason? Each island could only have 75-100 people on it. Company after company told me they were really excited by Second Life, but after they hit this limitation their excitement went way down. Why? Because few companies were going to spend the money to build a really compelling island to only have 75 people able to partake. The ROI just wouldn&#8217;t be there.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s next? Well, a variety of companies are trying to come up with 3D schemes that will overcome these issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vivaty.com/">Vivaty, today, comes out with one answer</a>. It&#8217;s too early to claim they&#8217;ve nailed it (they haven&#8217;t yet, especially because they haven&#8217;t gotten a Mac client out yet) but they get very close to building something really interesting that&#8217;ll get a lot of corporate types interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://qik.com/video/119588">Last week I interviewed Vivaty&#8217;s CEO with my cell phone</a> during which he gave me a demo of how it all works. It&#8217;s very cool. My blog or Facebook page could have a 3D scene embedded on it, and you could &#8220;dive into&#8221; the scene and walk around. These scenes are very graphically rich. I could put videos, photos, and other details around, along with prebuilt furniture and other things.</p>
<p>One disappointment? Right now it&#8217;s a Windows only thing and requires Internet Explorer. Firefox support is coming &#8220;within weeks&#8221; and Macintosh support is being built out, but probably won&#8217;t be here until sometime around the end of the year. That alone will keep the hype down on Vivaty, because most of the top bloggers I know are now using Macs.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is worth checking out, just to see the latest in stage of the art 3D worlds.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/usa-doing-fine-broadband-race-ncta-ceo-says">Before I started the interview with Kyle McSlarrow</a>, CEO of the <a href="http://www.ncta.com/">National Cable and Telecommunications Association</a>, I joked with him that he&#8217;s the most hated man in America, because everyone hates their cable company. He took that in stride and we dug in and talked about the state of broadband, how USA compares to Korea and other countries, and all sorts of issues like what cable is becoming and what his view of the technology industry is.</p>
<p>This is one of the Washington DC interviews we did.</p>
<p>We hear a lot of villification of this group in the media, so it&#8217;s nice to sit down and hear his point of view on a wide range of things. I love how he blamed me for using too much bandwidth at one point at about 17 minutes into the video.</p>
<p>Compare his responses on broadband and network neutrality to those from when <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/congressman-markey-worried-about-advertising">I interviewed Representative Ed Markey</a> or <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/the-geeky-congresswoman">my interview with Representative Zoe Lofgren</a>. You can see a rift, even if it&#8217;s a nuanced one.</p>
<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/ae687543-2459-4f5e-9eb7-62217bed2986/USA-is-Doing-Fine-in-Broadband-Race-NCTA-CEO/">Discussion of this video has already started on FriendFeed</a>. How about you, what do you think of the interviews we got in Washington DC so far? (a few more are coming soon)</p>
<p>Personally I came away with a lot better impression of the cable industry after this interview. What about you?</p>

<p>Yeah, you are probably sick of the FriendFeed hype. Sorry about that. But I do look around to see if there&#8217;s any other choices out there. Today I found one.</p>
<p>125,000 comments per day. Heck, FriendFeed doesn&#8217;t even have that many people on it yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://qik.com/video/123607">Here&#8217;s an interview with Topix&#8217; CEO, Chris Tolles, having a conversation with me</a> about the online community business. How is he doing it? He covers his advertising, his marketing, and other aspects of his business.</p>
<p>He also discusses the differences between &#8220;normal people&#8221; and people who read TechCrunch and hang out on FriendFeed.</p>
<p>Of course <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/35de01b6-4b2e-8699-703f-8d37a71ce9ba/Topix-a-local-news-community/">we&#8217;re discussing this video over on FriendFeed now</a>. :-)</p>
<p>Oh, and note that this was done with an updated Qik client which gives a little better quality.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I keep trying to ignore this year&#8217;s biggest technology industry news story. I&#8217;d rather try out the latest Twitter client (<a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/">TweetDeck </a>is the one on my screen right now and it&#8217;s pretty cool). But through that client came a torrent of news this morning and, indeed, <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080707/p27#a080707p27">the story is all over the top of TechMeme</a>. Steve Ballmer still wants to buy Yahoo, but only if Yahoo&#8217;s current board gets fired first.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care and I don&#8217;t feel sorry for Yahoo. I am thinking back to the first days of this story, back in January. I still remember Maryam, turning to me after I told her that Yahoo was turning down Microsoft. She said &#8220;are they crazy?&#8221; If a normal person can have that reaction, something must have been wrong inside the leadership of Yahoo.</p>
<p>Translation: Yahoo is being burnt to the ground by its current management.</p>
<p>Sometimes management does this. I wish I knew why. I&#8217;ve seen this happen at big companies and small ones (even some that I&#8217;ve worked at).</p>
<p>It causes a lot of consternation, layoffs, hurt careers, etc. But on Saturday I saw the silver light in all this: Silicon Valley just got a ton of innovators that now are free of bad management.</p>
<p>I was at a breakfast with a former Yahoo worker. He&#8217;d been laid off in this latest round of layoffs. He, and a friend, were starting a new company that is doing something I want (we&#8217;ll talk about this later after they come out of stealth mode).</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve heard of an ex-Yahoo employee doing something innovative, either.</p>
<p>Watch over the next year as a bunch of new stuff comes out because all of a sudden a bunch of ex-Yahoo employees are following their dreams. Even when they don&#8217;t start new companies, they are making contributions to other companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the cycle of life in Silicon Valley. The old mess up and screw up their companies, spinning off tons of smart people, and that helps the new happen.</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t expect me to cry about Yahoo.</p>
<p>Go Jerry, go!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Data: Mike Arrington, founder of TechCrunch, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/05/friendfeed-v-twitter-half-the-followers-in-five-months/">said in an article yesterday</a> that he has 10177 people subscribed to him on FriendFeed, about half of the number of followers he has on Twitter.</p>
<p>Data: Allen Stern, founder of Centernetworks, <a href="http://www.centernetworks.com/friendfeed-defaults">said in an article today</a> that Mike and I are one of the nine people that FriendFeed recommends (we&#8217;re right next to each other).</p>
<p>Data: Mike Arrington, according to FriendFeed, is my favorite user on that service. I like more of his posts than any other person, is what that means. So, everyone who is following me sees Mike Arrington&#8217;s posts and has an option to subscribe to them.</p>
<p>Data: 15,053 are following me on FriendFeed.</p>
<p>Data: Arrington&#8217;s blog is about 10x more popular than mine is.</p>
<p>Data: Arrington was named to Time Magazine&#8217;s top 100 most influential people list.</p>
<p>So, why do I have 5,000 more followers on FriendFeed than Mike Arrington does? Especially since he has more advantages than I do (10x more people listen to him on his blog everyday than listen to me &#8212; hence he should be able to get thousands to join a new service simply by saying &#8220;it&#8217;s cool&#8221;).</p>
<p>I call this difference the &#8220;Participation Premium.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at how Mike and I participate on FriendFeed:</p>
<p>1. Comments. Mike has only left <a href="http://friendfeed.com/techcrunch/comments">17 comments</a>, while I&#8217;ve left <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/comments">2,356 comments</a> over the same time period.<br />
2. Likes. These are votes on different items, they basically are telling other people that you think this item is important to read for some reason. Mike has only done <a href="http://friendfeed.com/techcrunch/likes">6 likes</a>, while I&#8217;ve left <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/likes">3,625 likes</a>.</p>
<p>What this is telling you is that you can easily get noticed in any community simply by participating. Yes, other factors do matter, but just by participating you&#8217;ll build an audience that &#8220;the popular kids&#8221; can&#8217;t get to.</p>
<p>In fact, this is exactly why Mike is at the top of <a href="http://www.techmeme.com">TechMeme</a> today. He participates in the blog world more than anyone. Holds parties. Takes his followers to the movies. Links to them. Argues with them, both on blog and on panels. He&#8217;s often seen here on my comments participating.</p>
<p>If you want to be Mike you&#8217;ve got to participate. There&#8217;s no other way.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, why am I participating in FriendFeed more than I&#8217;m participating in the blogosphere lately?</p>
<p>Easy: I think the community over there is geekier and more technology savvy (not to mention friendlier) than any other I watch (and I watch a bunch). It&#8217;s amazing how fast FriendFeed is growing, too. Remember, I&#8217;ve only been on FriendFeed four months. After being on Twitter four months I only had a few hundred followers. FriendFeed is a very viral community and is changing daily as new people discover it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>This week <a href="http://www.thomashawk.com">Thomas Hawk</a> (my favorite &#8220;Flickr-famous&#8221; photographer) and me will join a bunch of others on Microsoft&#8217;s campus up in Redmond, Washington, to attend <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/prophoto/prosummit.aspx">a pro photography summit that Microsoft is hosting</a>.</p>
<p>Why is Microsoft hosting a bunch of professional photographers?</p>
<p>Is it to kick off <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ProPhoto/">Microsoft&#8217;s Pro Photo Tools</a>, <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">Photosynth</a> ( which got me, in 2006, to say it was the demo of the year), or <a href="http://labs.live.com/Silverlight+2+Deep+Zoom.aspx">DeepZoom</a>? Maybe. After all, these things are really cool and photographers should flock to them in droves.</p>
<p>Is it because the digital photography market has finally gotten big enough to get Microsoft interested? Maybe.</p>
<p>But I think Microsoft has something else up its sleeve.</p>
<p>It knows that if Silverlight is going to have a chance against Flash it will have to get designers to give up Photoshop, or at least use other tools alongside.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because designers now are in control of the toolset that many companies will chose. What&#8217;s the most important tool to these designers? Photoshop.</p>
<p>So, along comes a Microsoft salesperson trying to get Silverlight and the Microsoft toolset in the door. Things go well with the developers, because .NET code is a lot nicer than Flash stuff. The management likes the pitch too, because they probably will get a break on something else they are already buying (Office/Sharepoint/Exchange are all very popular inside most corporations). But then the team gets to the designers and they say &#8220;give up Photoshop? Over our dead bodies.&#8221; And the deal ends and the team chooses Adobe&#8217;s Flash. Adobe&#8217;s salespeople then get a call and they come over and show off Acrobat.com, which is a hit against Microsoft Office and you can see how this goes.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll be watching this week to see what&#8217;s really behind Microsoft&#8217;s moves into photography. Is it to do something really remarkable (which Photosynth and Deep Zoom are)? Or is it to switch designers from Adobe stuff?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080704/p32#a080704p32">I see that there are people already waiting in line</a> for the Apple 3G iPhone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an expert on waiting in line for Apple products. My son and I waited 30+ hours in line last year to buy the first iPhone (we were first in line at the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA, which is the one closest to Steve Jobs&#8217; home).</p>
<p>Personally, the line was more fun than using the product. It&#8217;ll always be one of the things in my life that I&#8217;ll remember. We had famous Apple software developers, famous CEOs and venture capitalists waiting in line, and a lot of other fun people, too.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to say something shocking: the people this year who are waiting in line are chasing something that won&#8217;t show up.</p>
<p>First of all, the famous Apple geeks aren&#8217;t going to show up for an iteration, which is what this is.</p>
<p>Second of all, the TV crews will probably not show up this year. While there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;inside the bubble&#8221; hype for the 3G iPhone, the hype for everyone else is not even close to what it was for the first iPhone.</p>
<p>Third of all, if Apple has any supply constraints this year the real story will be the plumeting stock price. So, I predict there won&#8217;t be any lack of supply and that everyone who wants a 3G iPhone will get one. So, waiting in line won&#8217;t get you an advantage.</p>
<p>But, waiting in line for an Apple product is glorious, even if it is idiotic. It&#8217;s certainly one way to get on Techmeme without writing a blog.</p>
<p>Ahh, it&#8217;ll be a long week of Apple hype.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/e23ed27d-aba3-40c4-e7f3-ddd0f812263b/What-does-it-mean-when-Scobleizer-is-not-on-the/">Today several people noted</a> that I am no longer on Techmeme&#8217;s leader board.</p>
<p>Funny, lately I&#8217;ve been reading TechMeme less and less and caring less and less about whether what I do appears there. It&#8217;s why I went to Washington DC. I knew the other geeks like Mike Arrington wouldn&#8217;t link to those videos. Why? Well, as <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/the-geeky-congresswoman">Zoe Lofgren said in the conversation we had with her</a>, politicians are boring. I remember on a Gillmor Gang a few months back that Arrington announced that he was an entertainer. He&#8217;s right, and is one of the reasons why he owns the top of the Techmeme leaderboard. Me? I&#8217;d rather do something else than be an entertainer. I want to have smart conversations and if that means I&#8217;m not going to be on the Techmeme leaderboard anymore, so be it.</p>
<p>This week I was at Hewlett Packard hanging out with researchers who are working at the atomic level to find new ways to make memory and processors that will be far more important to all of us than whether or not there&#8217;s some people standing in line waiting for the next iPhone. But science isn&#8217;t sexy. You won&#8217;t see our video of that on TechMeme either.</p>
<p>Nor will you see the video that we did with the CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association that&#8217;ll be up on Monday. Nor will you see the WorkFast.tv video we did with Tim Ferriss. In fact, out of all the videos I&#8217;ve done this year I can&#8217;t think of one that&#8217;s been on Techmeme. Heck, my tour of CERN wasn&#8217;t on TechMeme, nor was our visit to IBM&#8217;s Research Center.</p>
<p>So, if I&#8217;m not chasing Techmeme anymore, what am I chasing? FriendFeed and Twitter. They are, together, where the audience that I really care about is hanging out. Who do I care about? Early adopters who want to have conversations with smart people about smart things.</p>
<p>Well, because <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/f22bc4bc-05f2-c0e4-e546-767e4edeb86f/My-Fourth-of-July-Present-to-you-the-geeky/">FriendFeed&#8217;ers care about learning something new about the industry</a> and not just getting entertained by the latest sensationalism.</p>
<p>Interesting that <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/07/04/announcingTechnewsjunkcom.html">Dave Winer just shipped a new tech news site</a>. Why? He&#8217;s disatisfied with Techmeme too. Funny, too, that I was talking with a journalist from a major news organization a couple of weeks back. He said &#8220;we only get 1,400 visitors when we&#8217;re at the top of Techmeme &#8212; that&#8217;s statistically insignificant.&#8221; I answered back &#8220;I am getting more visitors lately from Twitter and FriendFeed and the audience I get is more engaged and is usually reading Techmeme anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, just in case, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv">FastCompany.tv</a> is one of the advertisers on TechMeme now and I do read it a couple times a day just to see if I missed something (it&#8217;s been a long time, though, that it caught something that hadn&#8217;t already been discussed over on FriendFeed).</p>
<p>As another example, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/likes">look at the kinds of things I&#8217;ve &#8220;Liked&#8221; on FriendFeed lately</a>. Now compare that to <a href="http://www.techmeme.com">TechMeme</a>. Which one is more interesting? Why?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK if you say Techmeme is more entertaining. It is.</p>
<p>But is that all you want out of your tech bloggers and journalists?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Get in a patriotic mood by listening to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/the-geeky-congresswoman">our conversation with Zoe Lofgren</a>, the world&#8217;s geekiest politician (she&#8217;s a Congresswoman from Silicon Valley). This is part of our trip to Washington DC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re boring,&#8221; she said, when I noted that Andrew Feinberg chastized me and other tech bloggers for not going to Washington DC more often (Andrew runs the <a href="http://capitolvalley.net/">Capitol Valley blog</a> and setup these interviews for me).</p>
<p>After that bit of joking around we got into broadband policy, network neutrality, immigration policy, R&amp;D incentives, and she tells us what geeks should pay attention to in the political world of Washington DC.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and enjoy the Fourth of July with your families. For those of you who aren&#8217;t Americans, see ya on Saturday.</p>
<p>Some notable things she said: &#8220;it&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; she said, that we&#8217;re increasing our prosecution of nannies and decreasing our prosecution of organized crime.</p>
<p>She advocated for a chief technology officer and decried that there are still lots of pieces of the government that are still working on paper.</p>
<p>Regarding advertising, she admitted that the technology is moving faster than Congress can move.</p>
<p>Thank you to Seagate, producers of great storage devices, for sponsoring this show, which makes it possible for us to bring stuff like this to you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/">Upcoming.org</a> just updated with a major redesign. I think it&#8217;s going to accelerate the movement of people to Facebook to keep track of their favorite events (a trend that&#8217;s been accelerating lately). It&#8217;s sad, too, because this is one of the places where early adopters actually are engaging with Yahoo.</p>
<p>First of all, <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/user/138148/">my event page is dreadfully slow</a>. Demonstrates they haven&#8217;t tested it out on accounts that have tons of friends (they should stop trying to display thumbnails of all my friends).</p>
<p>But the home page that I see used to be a lot more useful, because it would categorize the kinds of events I was shown. It is dramatically different than it used to be. I hate when Web services redesign their sites so completely. It disorients users and gets them to wonder if there&#8217;s something better out there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I think they redesigned because of the &#8220;friend divide.&#8221;</p>
<p>See, sites like Upcoming really suck until you get somewhere around 40 to 100 friends. That is when Upcoming really became useful for me, because I could see the popularity of events and also had enough active users who were bringing interesting events into my view. The problem is that most people have fewer than five friends, so their experiences sucked and the events it was bringing into their view sucked.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they didn&#8217;t see a great way around this: I wish I could see, for instance, Scott Beale&#8217;s incoming events. He is one of those people who always finds out about interesting events and has an interesting group of friends.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter, though. The site is so slow for me that it&#8217;s almost forcing me to go to Facebook and handle my event calendar there.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to setup an interview with the team to get their take on these things and find out what drove such a complete redesign and what their goals are and also why they aren&#8217;t testing out their service for top users who are trying to spread their service around.</p>
<p>One major thing that&#8217;ll keep me on Upcoming rather than Facebook is FriendFeed&#8217;s integration. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/search?q=&amp;service=upcoming&amp;public=1&amp;who=">On FriendFeed I can see when people add new events</a>, which I find very useful to make sure my event calendar is kept up to date.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Interesting, this is probably why I don&#8217;t try to do news reporting anymore. I was briefed a few days ago on the Adobe/Google news, but <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080701/p9#a080701p9">already it&#8217;s being discussed on hundreds of blogs</a>. There is no longer much value in being first. So off I go today to hang out at HP&#8217;s Labs to get you some intimate looks into one of the world&#8217;s biggest companies. But I digress.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss this news. It&#8217;s significant because Google&#8217;s search engine can decide the marketplace winner between Adobe&#8217;s Flash and Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight. You think Google (or Yahoo, for that matter) is going to be very motivated to index Silverlight content? Rrrriiiiigggghhhhttttt.</p>
<p>Also notice which search engine isn&#8217;t playing the Adobe game: Microsoft&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Silverlight might be better technology, but if it doesn&#8217;t get indexed by the two biggest search engines it&#8217;s game over.</p>
<p>Now you might get some insight into why Microsoft wanted to pay $46 billion to buy Yahoo. Like Ballmer said &#8220;Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers!&#8221;</p>

<p>If traffic is your goal, here&#8217;s the formula. Do something really stupid that&#8217;ll make people laugh.</p>
<p>Me? I&#8217;ll stick with having a few thousand people passionate about <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-06-30-n40.html">learning more from innovative technologists and other leaders.</a></p>
<p>Why not get into the traffic race? Because I&#8217;d rather be in the race for a smart, focused audience. That&#8217;s where the real action is.</p>
<p>It also says volumes about why YouTube is losing millions of dollars every month. They can&#8217;t monetize this kid, and THAT should tell you how much real value there is in having a big audience.</p>
<p>Back to business: anytime I get a company who asks me about my traffic I&#8217;ll show them this blog post first and ask the question about why they haven&#8217;t sponsored this kid&#8217;s show already, since he has already won the traffic game.</p>

<p>I went off to Google to answer that question. Here&#8217;s the searches I did:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=McCain+tech+policy&amp;btnG=Google+Search">McCain tech policy</a></p>

<p>Well, assuming that they both have a tech policy (I don&#8217;t know that for sure yet, but they both should in today&#8217;s world) there&#8217;s one candidate that has much better SEO than the other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you click the links and figure out which one it is.</p>
<p>But, I&#8217;m wondering, who do you think has the best tech policy of these two guys?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>In about two years I&#8217;ll be ready for a new car. But here&#8217;s why I&#8217;m putting down some cash to get a new <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla</a> Sedan, which was just announced and will be ready in about two years. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/30/watch-arnold-announce-californias-deal-with-tesla/">TechCrunch has the video</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gas prices are probably going up from here, not down.</li>
<li>I want to be the first to have the sedan in my neighborhood.</li>
<li>When I took a ride in the first Tesla I learned that it can go more than 200 miles on just $3 worth of electricity.</li>
<li>Tim Ryan, Congressman, approves.</li>
<li>My vote, with my dollars, will help push other car companies into doing the same thing.</li>
<li>In just a year I put 20,000 on my Saturn Aura, and in two years we&#8217;ve put 40,000 miles on our BMW. Turning those miles into electric miles will make a big dent in our gas budgets.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll be built in California and I like keeping my money in the state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Downsides?</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;ll still need two cars, or rent cars, for when we need to go more than 200 miles in a day (recharging takes hours, not a few minutes like with gas). But that&#8217;s OK, we&#8217;ll still need two cars anyway, one for me and one for Maryam (in Half Moon Bay there are no public transportation options).</li>
<li>It&#8217;s expensive. More expensive than our BMW, which is a very expensive car for us.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s unproven technology and car. I remember when my dad bought a General Motors&#8217; diesel in the late 1970s and that was a disaster of a car and soured our family on GM cars for more than 15 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a ton of news coming out of the press conference this morning. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/30/tesla-announces-the-model-s-a-60k-all-electric-five-passenge/">Here&#8217;s Engadget&#8217;s writeup</a>. I&#8217;ll link to the best of it. In the meantime, if you didn&#8217;t watch the videos when we got a ride in the first production Tesla with Elon Musk, chairman of the board of Tesla, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/02/19/hanging-out-with-a-fast-company-emphasis-on-fast/">you should check these out</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Every week we film a live <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/workfast-tv">WorkFastTV show</a> at the Revision 3 studios in San Francisco as part of our <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv">FastCompanyTV</a> family of shows. It&#8217;s where we cover how work is changing thanks to the Internet. Last week we had BestBuy, one of the world&#8217;s largest retailers, on the show to tell us how they are using collaborative software to make themselves more productive and better train their employees. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/how-best-buy-engages-employees-improve-productivity">That video is now up</a>, some really interesting things they are doing with their 140,000 employees.</p>
<p>This week? We&#8217;ll film Thursday 10 a.m. Pacific Time because of the Fourth of July holiday here in the United States. Guest? New York Times Bestselling author <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Ferriss</a> (he wrote the 4-Hour Workweek). That should be lots of fun as we find out what he&#8217;s been doing to avoid working too much.</p>
<p>Who should we have on future shows? Coming up soon is David Allen, too.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve done a month&#8217;s worth of WorkFast, what do you like or hate about the show? How could we add more value to it for you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>One thing that came out of last week&#8217;s meetings with lots of elected officials is that their attention is on the advertising industry and that means our attention should be on it too. One interview in particular, with Representative Ed Markey (he&#8217;s the Chair of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet), stood out in my mind. He got very passionate about how deeply advertising is tracking people&#8217;s behavior and he&#8217;s worried about that.</p>
<p>So, over the next few months, I&#8217;ll be doing several interviews with people who are watching the online advertising industry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, we have an interesting interview with Mochi Media&#8217;s CEO, Jamison Hsu, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.tv/video/new-advertising-network-casual-games">where he talks about his company&#8217;s advertising network that&#8217;s aimed at online casual games</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if Congress tries to limit what these new companies, along with the older, bigger advertising-funded businesses like Google, Yahoo, MySpace.</p>
<p>If you were on Ed Markey&#8217;s committee, what would you be worried about with online advertising? Would you be voting to expand the ability for companies like Mochi Media to target advertising more tightly, or would you be forcing them to be more transparent about where their tracking devices are working?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>We shot most of the interviews on our two HD camcorders, but they are a lot harder to work, especially when we had to do five interviews in one day, like we did on Wednesday. We now have a new rule: no more than three interviews on any one day. Five almost killed us, especially since two of them weren&#8217;t in the same place so we needed to take taxis across town (and after doing all that work we had a party where 500 people showed up to see me and Gary Vaynerchuk &#8212; thanks to Andrew Feinberg and Nick O&#8217;Neil and several others for helping to make that a really great event).</p>
<p>We did so many interviews and meetings I am having trouble remembering them all.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if I can remember them all, and link to their videos on Qik.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/112504">Speaker of the House&#8217;s Private Balcony</a>. Great views down the National Mall.</li>
<li>Senator Tom Coburn. <a href="http://qik.com/video/112653">We got that on Qik</a>, but it&#8217;s hard to hear &#8212; we&#8217;ll get our HD version up in next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>Representative Tim Ryan. <a href="http://qik.com/video/112709">Part I on Qik</a>. <a href="http://qik.com/video/112730">Part II</a>. HD version coming soon. Those were shot with Andrew Feinberg&#8217;s Nokia. I also shot it, but we had a ton of trouble getting a reliable connection, so I didn&#8217;t get the whole thing. But my recordings are here: <a href="http://qik.com/video/112708">Part I</a> (before the Interview started). <a href="http://qik.com/video/112710">Part II</a>. <a href="http://qik.com/video/112720">Part III</a>. I called Tim &#8220;the Twittering Congressman).</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/112605">A tour of the Senate&#8217;s Press Room</a> (recording devices and computers are not allowed into the press area on Senate Floor).</li>
<li>Representative John Culberson. I liked him the best, <a href="http://qik.com/video/112740">he started out by showing us how</a> he ambushed a reporter with his Qik video camera. Then he sat down with us and <a href="http://qik.com/video/112764">we had a fun conversation</a>. Andrew Feinberg <a href="http://qik.com/video/112754">also filmed this interview and got a different point of view</a> on the conversation (I liked his view better, and my camera crashed so I missed some of the coolest stuff while we were walking through his office. Luckily Andrew got that).</li>
<li>Kyle McSlarrow, CEO of NCTA. Only filmed on our HD camcorders, we&#8217;ll have that up in the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>Representative Cliff Stearns. Only filmed on our HD camcorders, we&#8217;ll have that up in the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>Representative Ed Markey. Only filmed on our HD camcorders, we&#8217;ll have that up in the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein. <a href="http://qik.com/video/113607">Here&#8217;s my view of the Interview on my cell phone</a>. It&#8217;ll be fun to see this compared with our HD camcorders.</li>
<li>Representative Zoe Lofgren. Only filmed on our HD camcorders, we&#8217;ll have that up in the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>Barack Obama&#8217;s Tech Advisor, Alec Ross. Not filmed, since it was just a breakfast meeting.</li>
<li>White House Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel. See below.</li>
<li>Deputy Director of Newseum, Jack Hurley gave us a tour of the Newseum. More on that in a second. See below.</li>
</ol>
<p>We had two cancellations due to scheduling conflicts. Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi and Representative George Miller. We&#8217;ll be back in DC in September, so will try again then to setup interviews with them.</p>
<p>The Newseum tour was split up into several parts. The Deputy Director of Newseum showed us around.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114276">Lobby and 2-million-pixel screen</a>. Shows us a news helicopter hanging in lobby and world&#8217;s largest hydraulic elevators.</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114287">Top of Newseum</a> (great views of the Capitol).</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114293">Today&#8217;s Front Pages</a> (every day they hang more than 600 front pages from around the world &#8212; printed out via PDFs).</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114302">The 9/11 Gallery</a> where a piece of the Pentagon, the cameras of the only journalist to die, front pages from around the world on 9/12, and the top of the World Trade Center.</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114309">First Amendment walkway and gallery</a>, which explain and demonstrate the freedoms Americans have due to the First Amendment.</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114317">Master Control where a wall of computers and screens</a> let a group of technicians to run all the systems in the museum (which is massive).</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114321">Internet, TV, and Radio Gallery</a>. Twitterer Jim Long is even featured in one of the videos on one of the walls that explain blogging).</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114334">Journalists Memorial</a>, which shows the hundreds of journalists who&#8217;ve died. Also shows off an armored pickup truck that protected journalists and is riddled with flak and bullet holes. Later, at about 3 minutes into this video, we see a map of the world which shows whether or not your country has a free press.</li>
<li><a href="http://qik.com/video/114342">Interactive newsroom gallery</a>. Here you can create your own newscast, and play a game to test out your journalistic ethics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scott Stanzel, White House Deputy Press Secretary, <a href="http://qik.com/video/114468">shows us the Rose Garden</a>, the outside of the Oval Office, the press area, and more. Sorry about the poor quality, I couldn&#8217;t get much bandwidth out of the Rose Garden. Later Marine One (a helicopter that holds the President) <a href="http://qik.com/video/114479">arrives, and I get told I can&#8217;t do live video while the President is outside</a>. Even later <a href="http://qik.com/video/114495">Scott takes us into the White House Briefing Room</a> and gives us a tour of that.</p>
<p>Finally, as we were checking out of our hotel <a href="http://qik.com/video/114710">we encountered a crowd of press and protesters</a> waiting for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to show up.</p>
<p>Anyway, as we get more of our &#8220;pro quality&#8221; video up I&#8217;ll link those in as well.</p>
