			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just got back from the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1402321/">Silicon Valley Tweetup </a>(135 said they would come, 226 people saved it), last time this year, Tweetups were just about a dozen people or less, but the growth of the service has really demonstrated it&#8217;s popularity, I estimate 150-200 folks there.  Unlike blogs, microblogs can have a greater rate of adoption as the barriers to entry &#8211;and mobile devices &#8211;make it easier and less committal than others.</p>
<p>Some of my friends who came desired a more intimate setting split off to private dinners, and that&#8217;s fine too, the event is relatively organic, and we certainly want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Tonight was a success, and I&#8217;m pretty sure we were able to connect people to network and find jobs in this tough economy.  I polled the audience and asked folks to raise their hands if they were hiring, and about a third of them were hiring.  There were a lot of folks looking for jobs, and quite a few people who were consulting, and a few who just were recently laid off.  Strangely, there were people that came that never even heard of Twitter, which demonstrates how viral the event was &#8211;people passed the invite around on email.  </p>
<p>I had a few offers to get the event sponsored, something I&#8217;ll have to think about, but I&#8217;m generally steering away from that as this is testament that a community can self-organize without institutional influence.  I&#8217;ll add my pictures later, but wanted to get this post up, as I made a promise for folks to connect.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming out, the #svtweetup became a &#8216;trending topic&#8217; on twitter search, suggesting it was a top used tag for the evening.  How often do you think we should hold such a community event?  I&#8217;m sure folks will create smaller ones from time to time, but I&#8217;m thinking of other ways to help people that are seeking jobs connect with employers.  </p>
<p>Normally, I direct brands that are hiring to post on my job board, but given the state of the industry, I&#8217;m going to suggest that if you&#8217;re hiring (or seeking work) to leave a comment below with a brief description to your job post.  Don&#8217;t post the whole job req (I&#8217;ll remove it) instead just give a summary and link to the job posting.</p>
<p>Thanks for being part of the community, I&#8217;m happy to serve the community that I cover, you can read <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/12/06/recession-and-human-networking/">my commitments to the industry</a>.</p>

<p>I’m respecting your limited time by publishing this weekly digest on the Social Networking space, which I cover as an industry analyst. By creating this digest (I started this over a year ago) it really helps me to stay on top of the space I cover.</p>
<p>I’ve created a new category called <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/digest/">Digest (view archives)</a>. Start with the Web Strategy Summary, then quickly scan the succinct and categorized headlines, read text for my take, and click link to dive in for more.  </p>

Or you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebStrategyByJeremiahOwyangSocialMediaWebMarketingDigest">subscribe to this <em>digest </em>tag</a> only and not receive my other posts.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Web Strategy Summary</strong><br />
This was a very busy week, so focus on this summary to get the highlights: Facebook connect extends, Google friend connect in hot pursuit. Bebo relaunches with new design encouraging social sharing, promises upgrades in near future.  Ning removes adult content from website, leaving opportunities for others. The big trend? many systems are connecting to each other, data, and influence spread<br />
<hr />
<p><strong>Mobile: MySpace launches live streaming video</strong><br />
Just a week after Google announced it&#8217;s l<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/12/myspace_launche.html?chan=technology_technology+index+page_top+stories">ive streaming video features for mobile devices</a>, enabling users to access shows on demand from their mobile devices</p>
<p><strong>Trends: Is Social Networking Sinking?</strong><br />
This <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/business/21791/?a=f">contrary view is an important one to revenues</a>, layoffs and valuations, social networks may be waning.  The other key measurement to look at should be adoption and usage &#8211;I expect them to increase during a recession.</p>
<p><strong>Contest: HiveLive&#8217;s contests to help Tigers</strong><br />
This promotional contest, is a great way to tell the world about HiveLive&#8217;s flexible platform, and to do some good in the world.  The winner for this contest is going to <a href="http://www.hivelive.com/news/releases/16">help Conservation International build a community site to benefit Tigers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Security: Risks of Social Networks</strong><br />
This <a href="http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&#038;context=james_grimmelmann">very long PDF discloses the risks of the social networking space</a>, with a slight legal bent. I read as much as I could, it&#8217;s a bit dense.  Takeaway: most don&#8217;t realize the personal, financial, legal risks involved as social networks intersect business, personal, and family lives.  On a similar note, this very scary post demonstrates how easy it is to <a href="http://anythingtech.net/all-content/facebook-experiment-friends-100-4-days/">create a fake account and dupe people</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Redesign: Bebo&#8217;s Redesign Encourages social sharing</strong><br />
Much akin to the trend of newsfeed designs that were initially lead by Facebook, <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081210/aol-gets-more-social-with-renovation-of-bebo-but-theres-much-more-to-come/">Bebo ads new features in their overhaul</a>, perhaps most importantly is that they made promises to improve the major features, applications, and to integrate with AOL.</p>
<p><strong>Vision: Where is Facebook headed?</strong><br />
In a classic Techcrunch style, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/07/interview-with-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-products-funding-competition/">Arrington interviews Mark Zuckerberg</a> on his vision for products, revenue, developers, and valuation (oh and profile pics).  With Facebook focused on so many different areas, this leaves questions in the minds of brands &#8211;as they are unsure where to focus.</p>
<p><strong>Products: Physical Meets Virtual</strong><br />
At some conferences in Amsterdam, <a href="http://streamlinedmind.com/2008/12/03/poken-the-future-of-social-networking/#more-418.">a new physical tool called a &#8216;Poken</a>&#8216; has emerged that allows people to connect and trade information.  What ever happened to Palm Pilot beaming?</p>
<p><strong>Security: Facebook Virus Tears Through Network</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/webcontent/article.php/3789496/Latest+Facebook+Attack+Stems+from+Previous+One.htm">virus that we saw last week was apparently a strain of a previous one</a>, I received one of the messages and am now very cautious about what to click on.</p>
<p><strong>Predictions: What if Facebook Connect and Amazon were tied</strong><br />
Shiv Singh from Razorfish <a href="http://www.goingsocialnow.com/2008/12/imagine-if-amazon-integrated-f.html">demonstrates what could happen if social networks tied with eCommerce</a> and other websites in order to make web experiences social.  </p>
<p><strong>Connect: Pluck connects with Facebook</strong><br />
Facebook Connect allows third party sites to become social, and <a href="http://snipurl.com/76pwr">Pluck (of Demand Media) has initiated this with SFGate and other sites</a>. This means leaving a comment on SFGate can now show on your Facebook news page, if you choose to do so. Understand <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/07/23/what-facebook-connect-means-for-corporations/">what this means for Corporate Websites in the future</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study: Failed Social Networks</strong><br />
This list gives the <a href="http://www.bivingsreport.com/2008/a-look-at-failed-social-networks/">losers of the social networking space</a>, starting with Wal-Mart&#8217;s the hub.  Expect this list to grow during the recession as revenues dry up.</p>
<p><strong>Identity: Facebook Connect Across the Web</strong><br />
Mark blogs about Facebook connect, which is <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=41735647130">designed to connect websites with their social graph on Faceboo</a>k, the impacts to brands are astounding &#8211;corporate websites can now be social.  Of course, the <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/12/05/google-friend-connect-facebook-connect-good-start">competition between Google and Facebook</a> will rage over your friendships.  Need more info?<a href="http://news.cnet.com/1606-2_3-50004677.html"> Watch this video</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Ning to remove porn for networks</strong><br />
I met with the Ning folks yesterday, which they briefly discusses <a href="http://blog.ning.com/2008/12/the-end-of-the-red-light-district.html">removing adult content</a> from their network, <a href="http://socialshakers.com/2008/12/04/migrating-from-ning-to-rsitez/">rSitez moves in for the pluckings and offers migration options</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Culture: Drunken Photos Cost Women her College Degree</strong><br />
This poor soul made a bad choice in <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/social_network_profile_costs_woman_college_degree.php">uploading photos and patronizing her teache</a>r &#8211;resulting in her loosing her college degree.  Takeaway? Use permissions, realize that uploading is publishing and don&#8217;t be an idiot.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;m going to play doctor, in fact, I&#8217;m a specialist: A <em>corporate blog</em> doctor.  <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/12/09/consumers-say-your-corporate-blog-is-not-trusted/">Most corporate blogs aren&#8217;t trusted</a>, and here&#8217;s a very simple heuristic health check to gauge whether your corporate blog is going to be trusted by your readers.</p>
<p>This is a quick and dirty scorecard, if I was going one for a real Forrester report, it would be far more conclusive, weighted , detailed, quantitative, and scientific, but today, this is just a quick example, to illustrate a point we already know, let&#8217;s get to it, please, turn your head and cough:</p>
<hr /><strong>Health Check: How Trusted Is Your Corporate Blog?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Writing style:</strong><br />
How you write indicates how real you can truly be</p>
<blockquote><p>Great: Blog is written in a human voice<br />
Bad: Content looks vetted by corp comm<br />
Horrible: Rehashed press release
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Topics:</strong><br />
What does the blog talk about? does it matter to marketing &#8211;or customers?</p>
<blockquote><p>Great: Discusses the lifestyle (or workstyle) of actual customers<br />
Good: Discusses the wider industry topics<br />
Horrible: The corporate blog exclusively talks about the company</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Humility:</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important attributes, how human and real is this blog, or is it giving lip service?</p>
<blockquote><p>
Great: Admits when wrong and discusses in open the short comings of the company and product and demonstrates in public how it will be improved<br />
Good: Admits shortcomings but combats and defends the criticism, also known as spin<br />
Bad: Only discusses the company in the best possible light, and may link, but not take on critics<br />
Horrible: Never discuss the short comings of the company on the blog</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Linking Behavior:</strong><br />
Links are the currency of the blogosphere, it indicates you respect someone else&#8217;s opinion so much that you&#8217;re willing to send them away from you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Great: Links out to other sources, even competitors or critics as well as the next listed +1<br />
Good: Links out to other sources, where other discussions are occurring<br />
Bad: Primarily links to corporate created content 25% of the time<br />
Horrible: Primarily links to corporate created content over 50% of the time</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. Customer Inclusion:</strong><br />
Do corporate blogs allow their customers to partake? or are they only second class citizens</p>
<blockquote><p>Good: Allows for customers to guest blog, or includes snippets of their experiences<br />
Bad: Content is only published by employees</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>6. Dialog:</strong><br />
Allowing for feedback can instill more trust</p>
<blockquote><p>Great: Comments enabled and published instantly<br />
Good: Comments enabled but reviewed causing time delay<br />
Bad: Trackbacks only<br />
Horrible: No comments allowed
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>7. Comment Moderation:</strong><br />
Blogs that allow for disagreeing comments are more real &#8211;and interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Great: Comments (other than spam or off topic) are allowed, including direct disagreements<br />
Bad: Negative comments are censored or altered<br />
Horrible: No negative comments allowed
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>8. Frequency:</strong><br />
While more isn&#8217;t always better, having a steady rhythm of content is important</p>
<blockquote><p>
Good: A steady publication rate of posts appropriate to the speed of that market<br />
Bad: Posts appear at a random rate, often starting off with apologies for not posting<br />
Horrible: Posts appear to either promote the company during an announcement &#8211;or to combat a competitor</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s missing? leave a comment</strong><br />
What other categories do you think should be criteria?  Leave a comment and I&#8217;ll add it in, and credit you.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/make_your_corporate_blog_believable.html">Joe Wilcox from Microsoft Watch suggests that &#8217;story telling</a>&#8216; be an attribute to consider.  He makes a good point, but I could add that under the content, or writing style.  Not all blogs need to tell stories, some are blogs for product updates, or even support, but I get his point, thanks Joe.</p>
<hr />
<strong>The Doctor&#8217;s Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Strong specimen, keep at it: </strong>If you&#8217;re tallying up your corporate blog (you should ask your readers to help, so you&#8217;re a bit more unbiased) and you find that your blog is receiving many good or great scores, in fact over 75%+ of them, you&#8217;re on the way to be one of the 16% of trusted bloggers. </p>
<p><strong>On the way, but go back to the gym:</strong> If you&#8217;re getting borderline at 50-75% , with only about half the criteria being good or great, you&#8217;ve got some improvements to make. </p>
<p><strong>Minor Illness &#8211;but needs treatment:</strong> If you&#8217;re getting 25%-50% of the scores in good or great, you really need to evaluate your efforts and think if your corporate cultures is right for this, or if you even have the right bloggers on staff.  </p>
<p><strong>Terminally Ill: </strong>Lastly, if less than 25% of your criteria is good or great, you really need to consider shutting it down &#8211;you&#8217;re not getting it and your culture, strategy, or team should focus elsewhere.  Giving you the advice to take two in the morning ain&#8217;t going to cut it, it&#8217;s time for euthanasia.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this were a report, I would construct a scoring mechanism to help provide a sense of direction for this heuristic evaluation, or even more accurate, I would poll the actual readers of the blog to find out their opinions, but for the most part, the writing is literally on the wall.</p>
<p>Physician heal thyself: I guess I should also ask, how trusted do you think my web strategy blog is? </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25131367@N05/3094358118/"><img border="0" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3253/3094358118_0122b16c5c_m.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Left: This is the same graphic I discussed yesterday, &#8220;How much do you trust the following information sources?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday, we highlighted the findings from Forrester&#8217;s latest report on consumer trust. Although there has been quite a bit of <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=forrester+trust">discussion on Twitter</a>, on <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2008/12/people-dont-tru.html">Josh&#8217;s comments (read former colleague Peter Kim&#8217;s comments)</a> there&#8217;s been a mixed bag or reviews from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/corporate_blogs_trust.php">Read Write Web</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/corporate_blogs_believe_them_not.html">eWeek</a>.  So it&#8217;s out in the open: most corporate blogs are trusted, and the reasons are very obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s examine the graphic that was provided:</strong><br />
First, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25131367@N05/3094358118/sizes/o/">review this graphic in a separate window</a>, let&#8217;s start at the bottom and move our way up.  Right above corporate blogs, consumers nearly equally don&#8217;t trust social networking site profiles from a company or brand, no surprise, it&#8217;s often the equivalent of a corporate blog.  Strange that consumers don&#8217;t trust personal blogs? We actually saw other findings from <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/04/29/who-do-people-trust-it-aint-bloggers/">data that supports that blogs are not trusted</a>.  Then, moving up the graphic, we start to see an increase in trust from mainstream mediums like email from a company or brand, Wikis, radio, mainstream news websites, and print magazines. Finally, you start to see an uptake from social networking profiles of people you know, print newspapers, and then the yellow pages.</p>
<p><strong>So, Who Do Consumers Trust?</strong><br />
Perhaps what&#8217;s most interesting is that the top three are: Email from people you know, consumer product ratings and review,and search engines.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>77% trust email form someone they know.</strong> Makes sense, people we know in our truly intimate of circles are those who we keep closest. Websites that have a &#8220;Share this via&#8221; email may be a good start, using the vendor <a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis </a>is a good start.   Also, this suggests that marketers should start to think about letting other types of content be easily shared from email address to email.  We&#8217;ve always known that email was the first digital social network that mattered.</p>
<p><strong>60% trust consumer product ratings and reviews:</strong> I find both logical but we&#8217;ve some ways to go.  Right now, we&#8217;re leaning on reviews from individuals that may not be in our trust circle.  So as the social graph and eCommerce engines start to tie, we&#8217;ll soon have access to reviews of products from our direct network of folks we <em>really </em>know.  Razorfish has eloquently helped to <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/12/06/imagine-how-portable-social-graphs-will-impact-the-web/">visualize this concept with this presentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>50%: Say they trust portals/search engines:</strong> In Google We Trust, is that Charlene Li frequently used to tell me, and it still holds true.  When you look closely, the search engine results in Google are really social recommendations.  How so?  The Google algorithm (while I&#8217;m over simplifying) puts a great deal of weight on how humans organize, link, and create content.  </p></blockquote>
<p>So in summary, when you look closely, <em>people trust each other</em>.  If you&#8217;re not up to date on <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2007/12/the-post-method.html">Forrester&#8217;s POST methodology</a>, now is the time to learn, I ensure each of my clients knows it on my daily inquiry calls.  For the most part, this methodology is available in public and has been published on blogs and in slideshare, what&#8217;s key is that we understand the common framework of terms, particularly the five objectives: listening, talking, energizing, supporting, and embracing</p>
<p>As Josh alluded to in his comments, it&#8217;s time to focus on <em>energizing </em>(word of mouth), and maybe <em>supporting </em>(customers helping each other) &#8211;rather than <em>talking </em>(brands telling consumers)</p>

<p>While in the back of our minds, we all knew this was true.  Corporate blogs, like Jonathan Schwartz Blog and Bob Lutz of GM frequently talk about one thing &#8211;they&#8217;re companies and their products.  In fact, some would argue corporate blogs don&#8217;t live up to the dream of naked transparency as we saw from Robert Scoble way back in 2006.  Instead, many corporate blogs have become a rehash of press releases written in more of a human tone, yet fail to address the real conversation that&#8217;s happening in the marketplace.</p>
<p>In the above graphic, Josh Bernoff has conducted research and found that consumers said they trusted corporate blogs very little.  How little?<br />
<em><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Not only do blogs rank below newspapers and portals, they rank below wikis, direct mail, company email, and message board posts&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p></em> &#8211;in fact, a mere 16%</p>
<p>While I certainly discussed the findings with Josh before the report was published, he has far more details on the report, and answer <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2008/12/people-dont-tru.html">what you should (and survey methodology) do from his post</a>. </p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I spearheaded the corporate blogging program at Hitachi Data Systems, helped my two recent CEOs start blogging, and am an active &#8216;corporate&#8217; blogger myself.  Love to hear your thoughts on this, were you surprised?</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://blogcouncil.org/blog/here-are-a-few-trustworthy-corporate-blogs/">The Blog Council (a third party organization) has addressed the data</a>, and has listed out many of their trusted blogs, I think most are part of their council.  I wonder what the Blog Business Summit, Shel Israel, Dave Taylor will say &#8211;did corporations follow their instructions &#8211;doesn&#8217;t look like it.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://web1.forrester.com/forr/reg/campaignlogin.jsp?lr=/Marketing/Campaign2/1,6538,1946,00.html&#038;RegistrationID=1-CHMLJX&#038;regmode=marketingtrial&#038;iCampaignID=1946">You can download the report for free</a>, after your register on the Forrester site.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Some companies are wary of personal brands</strong><br />
Last week, I spoke to a social media strategist as a very large consumer packaged goods company, he expressed to me over this client call (called an inquiry) that he was concerned about employees getting too popular due to their personal brands and as a result, getting pulled right out of the company.</p>
<p><center><H2>[Despite that social technologies can improve customer relationships, the risks may be too great for some companies to bear, as a result, some corporations will shy away from allowing employees to have personal brands]</center></H2></p>
<p><strong>Personal brands can bring trust to monolithic corporations</strong><br />
In the age of transparency and conversation, brands know they need to join customers where they are, and that often means in social sites where real people are having real conversations &#8211;it&#8217;s about building trust.  As a result, social media marketing continues to be adopted by brands; I help them daily.   </p>
<hr /><strong>Examining the risks of personal brands</strong><br />
Personal brands are indeed a powerful tool, for one, it&#8217;s helped me get my current and previous job, and it will likely be a factor for my next, however there are a few risks to brands:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Risk 1: The personal brand is a cost to the company:</strong> Why let employees build their own brand on the dime of the company or leveraging the brand of the employer?</p>
<p><strong>Risk 2: The now popular employee is likely to get poached:</strong> Perhaps a common concern I hear is that competitors can easily identify the stars, and hire away these folks along with their market reputation and google juice.</p>
<p><strong>Risk 3: Employee exits leaving a chasm to fill: </strong>In the modern workforce, we hear less of lifetime employees seeking pension than we do of job migrants, or career gypsies that move from company to company every few years.  As a result, after they&#8217;ve built up trust with the market using social tools, they leave the company, and a gap is left that the brand can&#8217;t fill.</p></blockquote>
<hr /><strong>How companies respond </strong><br />
Brands respond to these risks in a number of ways, I&#8217;ve categorized them based on level of sophistication.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>First Reaction: Keep marketing faceless:</strong> Lean on traditional marketing, avoid human voices to come through.  </p>
<p><strong>Second Reaction: Approach with team or hybrid approach: </strong> Rather than encourage personal brands, you may instead see corporate team blogs that have an equal weighting to employees. Another example is with Dell and Oracle employees who fuse their name with their employer &#8211;it&#8217;s both personal and professional.</p>
<p><strong>Third Reaction: Let the customers be the product face:</strong> Perhaps the most sophisticated way to market a product isn&#8217;t to put your employees on the product blog, but instead, your customers.  I don&#8217;t see too many examples of this currently, but you can expect this to be an approach in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Reaction: Allow personal brands to proliferate: </strong> Some companies allow for employees to create their own blogs, generate revenue on their blogs, and be who and what they want.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Portable brands desirable in the age of career gypsies and job migrants</strong><br />
It&#8217;s rare to hear of the life long employee who retires after 40 years of service with a fat pension, in fact many workers today move from job to job &#8211;even more frequently in the tech industry. In the end, personal brands within the enterprise are inevitable, just ask <a href="http://danschawbel.com/">Dan Schawbel</a>  if anyone wants to track new talent, or hire Generation Y, they&#8217;ll have to accept that individuals will have personal brands and they are portable.  In fact, recruiters are often seeking on forums, blogs, and social networks to seek out talent.  </p>
<p><strong>Personal brands here to stay, with increase in adoption during recession</strong><br />
In my recent post, I pointed out that <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/12/06/recession-and-human-networking/">no matter how hard you work, or how smart you are, you can still get layed off</a>.  As a result, expect an increase in professionals to be on social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn, and using conversational tools like blogs and twitter to promote their offerings.  The savvy career gypsy will build this up before they need a job.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve put all the options and variations out there, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think corporations should do to protect their resources (brand, talent, and time), as well as build trusting relationships with customers?</p>

<p>Left: The famed HP Labs think tank in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I spent an entire day with the<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/"> HP Labs group</a> in Palo Alto, they&#8217;re responsible for the R&#038;D and innovation that goes into their thousands of technology products on the market.  I was pleased to see this deep dive scientific research on Twitter by Bernardo A. Huberman, Daniel M. Romero and Fang Wu.   </p>
<p>You can read the free <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/scl/papers/twitter/twitter.pdf">Social networks that matter: Twitter under the microscope (PDF)</a>. Written in an academic style, it&#8217;s a bit dense for the casual reader.  I write for a business audience and I&#8217;ll strip out the most important findings, and add my own insight to what I think matters.  As always you&#8217;re welcome to chime in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding HP Lab&#8217;s Twitter Research:</strong><br />
If you just need a summary, I wrote this in a way that you can just read the bolded elements to get a sense of the report.  I hope this saved you some time.</p>
<blockquote>
<li><strong>Most users have a smaller inner circle they communicate with: </strong> Within a social network, it was found that most only frequently communicate with a small segment of users &#8211;even if one has a large community.  Makes sense, everyone has an &#8216;inner circle&#8217;. Finding the true network that an individual has (even if they have thousands of &#8220;friends&#8221;) is what&#8217;s really important.  Although Scoble solicits imput from thousands of contacts, he leans on a <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/09/26/the-scoble-top-tech-bloggerfriendfeedsocial-media-list/">smaller subset of folks</a> to trust above all others.</li>
<li><strong>HP Labs Sample Size is @ 6% of the Twittersphere:</strong> HP Labs took a random sample set of Twitter users, for a base of number of 309,740 users. According to <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/11/19/social-networks-site-usage-visitors-members-page-views-and-engagement-by-the-numbers-in-2008/">my social network stats tracking</a> page, Twitter&#8217;s total universe is somewhere between 4-5 million (still very small).  I&#8217;ll value the network on the 5 mil side, so that&#8217;s sample size of about 6%, which is pretty healthy.</li>
<li><strong>On average, most had 85 followers:</strong> They found that the average user has 85 followers in their network, this number seems reasonable when averaged out across the network.</li>
<li><strong>On average, most had 80 friends:</strong> Most users followed back 80 others, which is close to the actual follower number.  Perhaps some weren&#8217;t following spam bots, or people that follow everyone. <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2008/12/05/assymetrical-follow-a-core-web-20-pattern/">James Governor has been discussing asymmetrical networks</a>, but it appears that on the average, most are symmetrical.</li>
<li><strong>Tweet Frequency? About one a day: </strong> On average, these users had posted 255 tweets, and since the average users has been around for nearly 7 months, thats about 36 tweets per month, or little bit over one a day.</li>
<li><strong>68%: are active users</strong> Social networking stats are almost always flawed, as the vendors don&#8217;t disclose how many are truly active. I define active user base as logged in and completed an activity in the last 30 days. Among the 309,740 users only 211,024 posted.  It&#8217;s unknown if this filtered out spam tweets, although nearly 2/3rds of users have returned (site stickyness.  That&#8217;s a pretty good return to site rate. </li>
<li><strong>Most members have been on twitter nearly 7 months:</strong>  The research showed that the average person (from first to last post) was active for 206 days.  This means that June 2008 (report written in Dec) has become somewhat of a trigger point, perhaps where a growth curve started to point upwards. I noticed an influx of users on April 2008, two months before HPs findings, <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/12/11/some-conversations-have-shifted-to-twitter/">see comment #579</a></li>
<li><strong>A quarter of tweets (@) are directed at other users:</strong>  The report showed that Around 25.4% of all posts are directed, by using the &#8220;@user&#8221; which is responding to others.  This could suggest that the other 75% of tweets are updating their network of what users think is interesting or discussing &#8216;what they are doing&#8217;</li>
<li><strong>The more followers, the more they tweet &#8211;up until a point:</strong>  Figure 1 indicates frequently in posting the more followers they have, right up until about 500 followers where the frequency starts to level out (if the graph were smoothed).  The data around number of friends suggests a similar graph, although there&#8217;s no saturation point (see figure 2).  I&#8217;ll suggest the more connections a user has, the more value they have, and therefore are more active.</li>
<li><strong>Despite having large networks, a smaller circle is maintained:</strong> For users with a high number of followers, they actually only still communicate with a smaller subset of users. This rule remains constant see figure 4.</li>
<li><strong>Where&#8217;s the value? within the hidden network:</strong> To find out the real value of a twitter user and their network, finding out their true network of folks they communicate with on a regular basis will show their trusted network.  Finding out who the Scobles&#8217; communicate with the most will determine will help find out how he is influenced.</li>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Business Opportunity for Measurement Vendors</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re a social media measurement company, and can find out the true influence model of who people really trust above all other users by looking at actual &#8220;@&#8221; behavior and follow behavior, be sure to leave a comment below showing how you can do this.  Then, conducting this by topic, will find out the true influencers by market segment within the Twitterpshere.</p>
<p><strong>Brand Opportunity</strong><br />
As we know, traditional advertising doesn&#8217;t work well in social networks, &#8216;carpet bombing&#8217; isn&#8217;t effective.  However, conversational marketing is also costly, as you have to spend great resources on labor to communicate with influencers. Therefore brands who want to be effective with their resources should find out who is an influencer in their market and focus their conversational marketing primarily on them.</p>
<p>Thanks to the HP labs team who did a great report and really helped to further understanding Twitter better, when you have time, invite me over for lunch, I&#8217;m in the area.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made a promise to be transparent with the mysterious industry analyst job, in fact, I didn&#8217;t completely understand all aspects of what the job entailed until being here for a few months.  I realize that the public usually doesn&#8217;t understand the research industry business model, or how we help our clients make decisions.  So in an attempt to explain what I do (read other posts tagged<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/analyst/"> analyst </a>to learn of other aspects) to understand one important part of my job: advisory.</p>
<p><strong>Make Leaders Successful</strong><br />
Last week, I wrapped up another project with a technology client where we helped them develop a social media strategy based on actual research &#8211;a powerful way to ensure your efforts will be successful.  Although Forrester has a consulting arm, I really consider our services as &#8216;advisory&#8217; where we help clients understand the different choices they can make, make a decision based on research and data, and then suggest the appropriate course of action.  </p>
<p><strong>Project: Social Media Strategy</strong><br />
In this project, we helped a technology company enhance and expand their existing social media strategy.  They had read the Groundswell book and understood the POST methodology, they understood how important it was know their customers before choosing social technologies.  We kicked off with scoping discussions, understanding the needs of the business, and learned about their marketplace and customer base.  Next,  we then created a survey which was fielded to their market of influencers and decision makers where we asked questions about their: Demographics (who are they) Psychographics (what do they care about) Media Consumption (What do they read, and from where) and Technographics (how do they use social technologies.  </p>
<p><strong>Assembling the Team</strong><br />
Scientific surveys are a tricky beast, so we lean on our data experts like Cynthia Pflaum who helped to design, field, process and analyze the data from the survey.  We have folks from traditional consulting backgrounds, and if you work with me you&#8217;ll likely meet consultant Nicole Belanger, who ensures we&#8217;re meeting the needs of the client, and we stay on target.  My role as the subject matter expert is to make specific, make sense of the data, make specific recommendations, and provide a clear course of action for the client.  To be quite honest, making recommendations becomes very easy once you have all the information in front of you &#8211;research is a very powerful tool.</p>
<p><strong>Research Helps Reduces Risk and Increases Success </strong><br />
We had several meetings with the client, to share initial findings, discussion the different paths, and ended things off this past week with a presentation to the entire marketing team. Nothing pleases me more than to see the impacts I&#8217;m making with clients, in this case I learned that the client had already started with some of the newer recommendations based off the research.  In some cases, clients are seeking clarification for their existing plans, so in addition to directional guidelines, we also help our clients with best practices (the report on community best practices, is very popular) and vendor selection, that&#8217;s why the upcoming Wave report on community platforms will really change buying behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Full Circle: Client Feedback</strong><br />
Of course this story is incomplete, it doesn&#8217;t include the feedback from the client themselves!  I know they are readers of this blog, so they&#8217;re welcome to review this project process in a transparent manner, either as a guest post, either anonymously or disclosed, or they don&#8217;t have to disclose at all.  Perhaps more importantly, we&#8217;ll revisit their social media activities in a few months to track progress, I certainly hope the data and recommendations sets them up for success.</p>
<p><strong>Fail Fast: I make mistakes too</strong><br />
In the spirit of transparency, things don&#8217;t always go well with clients, about once a quarter I stumble with a client engagement, or a client complains about my performance.  I&#8217;ve learned where I&#8217;m challenged, such as: freaking out when I&#8217;m overwhelmed, making sure I&#8217;m prepared, checking my ego, and setting expectations with clients, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve mastered all these, I&#8217;ve still got a lot to learn, but like everyone else, I stumble too.  The <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/30/fail-fast/">key thing I&#8217;ve learned from making mistakes is to fail fast</a>, and try to quickly get back up after licking my wounds. We all must grow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/11/10/what-is-social-graph-executives/">Over one year ago</a>, we defined the Social Graph as an online representation of our relationships. These graphs define our personal, family, or business communities on social networking websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.razorfish.com/">Razorfish</a>, an Interactive Firm owned by Microsoft serves the largest brands in the world. When I first met with them earlier this year, they were just growing their practice, primarily lead by Shiv Singh.  In fact, their CEO told me that social at the time, was just one component (a small one at that) for their agency.   Things are starting to change, since we met a few weeks ago in SF, they told me that social media practice has extended to many of their accounts and will likely increase during the coming year.  You can visit <a href="http://www.goingsocialnow.com/">their blog Going Social Now</a>, to learn more about their focus on the social web.</p>
<p>The above presentation helps to visualize how social technologies change business, ecommerce, and corporate websites.  When I heard Mark Zuckerberg tell us how Facebook connect would be linked with different websites, I had a feeling of how dramatic this would change the web &#8211;and wrote this piece What <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/07/23/what-facebook-connect-means-for-corporations/">‘Facebook Connect’ Means for Corporate Websites</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>Key Takeways</strong></p>
<blockquote><li>The social graph, when linked with traditional websites will radically change how we find, research, purchase, and support products. </li>
<li>Reviews, ratings, and critiques about products will become more relevant as you can start to get information from your own network.</li>
<li>Soon, social technologies will be pervasive and will impact every website &#8211;even if they choose not to participate</li>
<li>Brands, and their interactive marketing agencies, are starting to include social elements in all aspects of their marketing efforts.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Things are going to get worse before they get better</strong><br />
It&#8217;s official, <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/markets/articles/2008/12/02/recessions_official_now_what/">we&#8217;re in a recession, say economists</a>.  Four quarters since Q4 2007 indicate this economic change and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&#038;sid=abNkJn4mGKlE&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg reports that</a> &#8220;The U.S. economy may be headed for its deepest and longest recession since World War II&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Things look even more grim as the, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081205/ap_on_bi_go_ec_fi/financial_meltdown">Associated Press reports</a> that employers cut 533K jobs in Nov., most in 34 years&#8221;, of course this impacts personal lives as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/la-fi-foreclose6-2008dec06,0,892360.story">LA Times</a> shows that 10% of homeowners are in or are nearing foreclosure status. My job is to listen to the marketplace, and I didn&#8217;t hear anyone talking about this until Sept 2008, it&#8217;s as if US, and the world were taken by surprise.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the scariest thing for most, is that <em>no matter how hard you work, you could get layed off</em>.  Your division, your budget, or your role could get eliminated.  </p>
<p><strong>Five Ways Web Professionals Should Be Proactive In a Recession</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not all doom and gloom, here&#8217;s how you can be proactive, even if you work at a Fortune 100, you are after all, a company of one, so respect yourself and be proactive:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Learn How to Adjust at Your Day Job</strong><br />
I survived 10 rounds of layoffs and was the final 12.5% of Exodus before I went to work at World Savings, what did I do learn? The trick is to stay flexible and demonstrate you can adapt, increase revenues, or use your skills in a scalable and efficient way.  You&#8217;ll also need to properly internal market your abilities within your corporation or with your clients to demonstrate why you and your services give greater return out the end. Fortunately, the web can be such a tool &#8211;if you know how to do it right.</p>
<p><strong>Understand How Social Media is a Risk and Opportunity</strong><br />
Social media has an opportunity in a recession, these tools are cheap, some marketing campaigns range from 10-50k on the low end, far less expensive than any traditional marketing.  Of course, with comes great risk: doing it wrong can result in a punking, not doing anything at all could leave you exposed, and most brands overlook the amount of labor required to develop these programs.  As a result, I&#8217;m working on an upcoming report, and we&#8217;re surveying social media marketers to find out if they&#8217;re going to increase &#8211;or decrease &#8211;their social media resources during a downturn.  In fact, we&#8217;re re jigging some of my research agenda to meet the needs of the market and client &#8211;so stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Use Online Networking Tools to Connect</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re a web professional, or are involved with social media in your career, I want you to network with others in my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2591582686">Web Strategy Facebook Group</a> (there are over 9000 folks there), or within the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3553055120">Community Manager Facebook Group</a> (over 2000 folks).  You should also be updating your LinkedIn Profile (doing so triggers updates to others) and connect and reconnect with folks you need to synch up with.</p>
<p><strong>Attend Real World Events</strong><br />
The need to connect in person (yes, real life) is the core essence of what makes us social animals, and as a result, I&#8217;ve organized a free networking event called a <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1402321/">Tweetup in Silicon Valley this coming Thursday</a>, and 81 intent to come, and 62 others are interested.   I found this list of <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/12/04/10-essential-steps-to-take-before-youre-laid-off/">things to do before you get layed off</a> very helpful. If you&#8217;re in the area, come out to the event, bring your clients, meet clients, network with others, now is the time to link in with others, <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/12/build-your-network-before-you-need-them/">build your network before you need them</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Always Be Looking For Opportunities</strong><br />
Even if your work for a corporation you&#8217;re a company of one, you have control over your destiny, therefore you must always have your ear to the rail, listening and meeting folks that could potentially help you.  I&#8217;ve made friends with some of the top recruiters in the web industry, and I&#8217;ve been helping them when the economy was good &#8211;think ahead.  If you recently were layed off, or are looking to move up, <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2008/12/are-you-good-en.html">Forrester is hiring a social media analyst</a> (email your resume to jowyang at forrester dot com), and you can peruse the <a href="http://webstrategy.jobamatic.com/a/jbb/find-jobs?">Web Strategy Job Board</a> or learn who has recently been hired and <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/on-the-move/">on the move</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>My Commitment</strong><br />
Stay close to this blog, those who are readers benefit not just from the content on the blog, but more importantly the community that surrounds this blog.  I&#8217;m only as successful as those around me, so it&#8217;s in my best interest to help you &#8211;we can do this together.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few things I can do to be proactive, and they include:</p>
<blockquote><li>I&#8217;m here for the long haul, I knew the internet was my calling, been through dot bomb, and will be here after this dip.</li>
<li>In my day job as an Industry Analyst, I will conduct research to find out what marketing efforts work &#8211;and don&#8217;t&#8211; in a recession. </li>
<li>I&#8217;ll continue to post on this blog, and gear content that doesn&#8217;t just talk about the economic changes, but gives some suggestions to improve.</li>
<li>Offer online community resources that allow my network to benefit directly from each other, like Facebook networking.</li>
<li>Highlight who&#8217;s hiring, who got hired, and why. Discuss what skills are needed in the future to be successful.</li>
<li>Continue to organize free community events (like Tweetups) for those to meet, connect, and grow as a group.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been receiving questions about the much anticipated Community Platform Wave report, and wanted to provide an update.  I&#8217;ve completed a majority of the report and it&#8217;s currently with the editing team getting the t&#8217;s crossed and i&#8217;s dotted.  We&#8217;re expecting an early January publication date, and <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/10/24/status-forrester-wave-report-for-community-platforms-analysis-part-34/">I&#8217;ve been making an effort to be upfront and transparent with updates</a>.  Also, there&#8217;s a teleconference that many of you may have signed up for in this Dec, however we&#8217;ll be pushing it back in order to coincide with the publication date.  Update: The report will publish in early Jan and <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/teleconference/forrester_wave%26trade%3B_report_community_platforms/q/id/5225/t/1">the teleconference is now on Feb 3rd</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a client of Forrester, you can schedule an inquiry call with me to discuss your plans for selecting a community platform vendor &#8211;or view this <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/08/04/forrester-report-vendor-product-catalog-of-community-platforms-for-the-interactive-marketer/">vendor product catalog</a> (free for anyone) which has over 50 of them listed out.  I&#8217;ve already helped a few clients with vendor selection based upon the data found in the report, research really is a powerful process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received a few questions about the smart folks at Gartners take on this space, and they&#8217;ve recently published a magic quadrant on social software (<a href="http://collaborate.jivesoftware.com/content/promo_reg_081031_gartner-magic-quadrant">Read a copy on Jive&#8217;s site</a>), but it looks like they may be including more internal tools, and are including a plethora of vendors.  </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t comment on their research (as I wasn&#8217;t involved) but the focus on the Community Platform wave is for interactive marketers at enterprise size companies, also I&#8217;ll only be including 9 vendors and they are all community platforms (not collaboration, not wiki players, not insight vendors).  This means external deployments (communities for customers), and not internal, it looks like we&#8217;re approaching it at two different angles.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m working on a report to understand how baby boomers (like my mom and dad) use social technologies, so expect to see that publish in the near future.  While youth certainly adopt social tools, boomers are also reading and participating.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hearing of more and more brands starting to venture into the Twittersphere to listen, influence, and support customers.  In fact, I&#8217;ve had 3-4 inquiry (client calls) at Forrester asking about Twitter for marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge: Anyone can Create an Twitter Account and Cause BrandJacking</strong><br />
A few months ago, many (myself included) <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/08/01/how-janet-fooled-the-twittersphere-shes-the-voice-of-exxon-mobil/">were fooled by a brandjacking of &#8220;Janet&#8221; from Exxon Mobile</a>, (see examples <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/05/02/a-chonology-of-brands-that-got-punkd-by-social-media/">of others brands who were punk&#8217;d</a>) who in reality wasn&#8217;t who she said she was.  I&#8217;ve also heard from other brands that name squatters were taking corporate names and registering them, and some are saying negative things.  Slow brands are often behind, and as a result have to deal with cleanup.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard from some brands that if you contact Twitter, they will disallow anyone from registering your corporate name, but I can&#8217;t confirm this is true, if someone from Twitter wants to discuss with me how brands can best work with the microblogging tool, please let me know.</p>
<p>If your brand is planning on venturing into the twittersphere, after you develop a strategy based on the <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2007/12/the-post-method.html">POST methodology</a>, you should then confirm your twitter address so your customers and community can confirm it&#8217;s really you.  Until we get a single sign on and identity verification process across the whole web, we need a way to confirm twitter accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Confirm tour Corporate Twitter Account</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1) Link to your twitter profile from your corporate website:</strong> Since no but official employees can edit your corporate website, this is an &#8216;official&#8217; way of confirming identity.  If your corporate site is Hitachi, then perhaps on the Hitachi news site, or official Hitachi blog (providing you have one) link to the Twitter account.  </p>
<p>2<strong>) Cross link from your Twitter profile page to corporate site:</strong>  Since most won&#8217;t know of the link from your corporate site, you now must update your Twitter profile (where you describe yourself) and point back to the corporate webpage that mentions the twitter account.  This is called a &#8220;cross-link&#8221; and will confirm that the twitter account is official.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Are you a Twitter user? Require confirmation from brands before engaging. </strong> Anyone in the Twitter community who runs into a corporate twitter account, should point brands to this very blog post, and ask them to confirm their identity, if they don&#8217;t, ignore them.  Hope this tip helps brands, consumers, and the twittersphere.  Good luck all.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The reason I did this post as I engaged in a conversation with Bissell, yup the vacuum company, as I was recently discussing getting a steam cleaner to deal with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremiah_owyang/sets/72157609852656912/">puppy Rumba&#8217;s</a> number 1 spots.  They approached me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/wemeanclean">@wemeanclean</a>) and suggested a product to me (the <a href="http://www.bissell.com/Products/c/portabledeepcleaner/p/spotbot_pet/product.aspx">SpotBot</a>), and I suggested that they confirm their identity, they have, and now have linked to their twitter account from the footer of their corporate homepage at <a href="http://www.bissell.com/">bissel.com</a>.  Well done, you&#8217;ve now taken one more step closer to earning my trust, and I&#8217;m more likely to engage in conversation and take a closer look at your products. </p>
<p>Now, about those steam cleaners&#8230; I am in the market&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the Motrin Moms kerfuffle blew up and <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/11/17/motrin-mothers-groundswell-by-the-numbers/">I tracked it by the numbers</a> just a few days after the explosion.  Nearly three weeks later, it&#8217;s time to revisit the incident to see what&#8217;s happened.  </p>
<p><center><br />
<h2>[Brands that get <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/05/02/a-chonology-of-brands-that-got-punkd-by-social-media/">punk&#8217;d</a> by social media have an opportunity to quickly respond and enable the groundswell to pirouette the energy towards a positive direction]</center></h2>
<p><strong>Running the numbers you can see interest has piqued for Motrin:</strong><br />
<center><br />

People are curious: Google insights indicates a spike in searches for the term &#8220;Motrin&#8221;. </p>

There&#8217;s more interest in Motrin than other competitors: comparing terms &#8220;Motrin&#8221; to &#8220;Tylenol&#8221; and &#8220;Ibprofen&#8221; other brands in the space, there&#8217;s a peak that outperforms the market.</p>

Despite this interest the Motrin has generated the corporate webpage still has an apology dated from Nov 20th (today is Dec 4th)<br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>Motrin misses an opportunity by sulking in the corner</strong><br />
Unfortunately, not much has happened from Motrin&#8217;s behalf. The motrin.com corporate homepage is dated with an apology from Kathy Widmer dated Nov 20th and referencing an apology &#8220;4 days ago&#8221;.  Whether or not you think that Motrin did something wrong with their ad or not it really doesn&#8217;t matter, as there&#8217;s an opportunity being wasted that Motrin should leverage.  My job is to help the largest brands in the world understand and benefit from connecting with their customers using web tools, and if motrin were my client, I would advise them with the following:</p>
<p><center><br />
<h2>[Rather than wallow in sorrow, Motrin should leverage global interest in it&#8217;s brand.  Rather than <em>telling </em>customers what pains them, Motrin should benefit from word of mouth by <em>asking </em>the community &#8220;what pains you?&#8221;]</center></h2>
<p><strong>Rather than cower in the shadows, Motrin should:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1) Stop Reacting and Develop a Strategy To Lead:</strong> Learn how to Judo throw by using the weight of the Groundswell to aid you.  Before deploying any tactics, first understand that there are many eyeballs now on Motrin and in some PR circles this is good press from bad &#8211;leverage it.  If you&#8217;re listening to a <a href="http://www.forimmediaterelease.biz/index.php?/weblog/comments/the_hobson_holtz_report_podcast_399_november_20_2008/">recent podcast episode of For Immediate Release</a> there&#8217;s global attention on Motrin within the social media circle that is quite amazing since the product is only sold in US.</p>
<p><strong>2) Remove the Apology:</strong> Suck it up and take that down the mea culpa.  In the scheme of things, not every mother was insulted, and the Motrin moms is not indicative of what&#8217;s being said by moms that didn&#8217;t even see the video ad.   Motrin has responded quickly, removed the ad and given a sincere apology in my opinion.  Great, now it&#8217;s time to move towards the path of recovery.</p>
<p><strong>3) Listen to the Community by Asking &#8220;What Pains You&#8221;: </strong>At Forrester, we use the term &#8220;Listening&#8221; as one of the objectives for social computing, suggesting that brands can better understand their customers by gleaning insight to what&#8217;s already being said. Here&#8217;s the opportunity for Motrin to leverage the Groundswell, since many members have already created their own ads (such as this clever play on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqpAGLS2t4">big boobs</a>), build off the momentum and develop a program to ask mothers what pains them.  Obviously telling them what pained them, and playing the empathy card backfired, so instead, just ask them.  Allow them to  tag the videos, photos, and blog posts with #whatpainsme.</p>
<p><strong>4) Allow the Groundswell to Advertise on Your Behalf:</strong>  Now that this content has been created by the community, aggregate the popular posts, tweets, video and images on your blog, or corporate homepage, and allow the discussion to continue.  Fortunately for Motrin, the worst criticism has already occured, so by even including negative submissions shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. By doing this, Motrin will be the center of discussion around pain &#8211;which can offer a solution with their relief products. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above example is advice I would give Motrin if they were my client, but I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of other ways to allow both the community and brand to win.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s just my take, if you were reporting to the VP of Marketing at Motrin, what would you recommend they do?</p>

<p>I’m respecting your limited time by publishing this weekly digest on the Social Networking space, which I cover as an industry analyst. By creating this digest (I started this over a year ago) it really helps me to stay on top of the space I cover.</p>
<p>I’ve created a new category called <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/digest/">Digest (view archives)</a>. Start with the Web Strategy Summary, then quickly scan the succinct and categorized headlines, read text for my take, and click link to dive in for more.  </p>

Or you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebStrategyByJeremiahOwyangSocialMediaWebMarketingDigest">subscribe to this <em>digest </em>tag</a> only and not receive my other posts.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Web Strategy Summary</strong><br />
With Social Networking sites amping up their offerings around logins (like OpenID, Facebook Connect, and Google Friend Connect) more questions arise if websites &#8211;and brands should participate.  Additional research reinforces how advertising doesn&#8217;t work on social networks &#8211;yet are brands ready to role up their sleeves and be part of the community they serve?<br />
<hr />
<p><strong>Theory: Should social networks federate or aggregate?</strong><br />
Two classes of social networking companies are appeating, the first class, like MySpace, Facebook, and LinkedIn are offering identity systems (open ID, Facebook Connect or Google Friendconnect) to connect with other websites.  The second class of companies are aggregating the existing content of these social networks, like Friendfeed and Ping FM,<a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/30/social-webs-big-question-federate-or-aggregate/"> GigaOm compares both sides</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Research: Social Network Users Less Receptive To Advertising, IDC</strong><br />
More than half of U.S. consumers with Internet access use social networking services (SNS), such as Facebook and MySpace, and penetration will continue to grow. According to a new study from IDC, consumers are also spending ever-greater amounts of time on SNS, a fact that has advertisers drooling over the opportunity represented by SNS, <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS21540708">data from IDC</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing: How to use social networks for marketing and PR</strong><br />
This high level primer from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/allbusiness/AB11702023_primary.html?ref=smallbusiness">NYTs discusses how brands can get started</a> with their PR and marketing efforts on social networks.  They suggest profiles and connections, groups, then discussion areas.</p>
<p><strong>Identity: Criticism over Facebook Connect&#8217;s Federation</strong><br />
Not everyone agrees that the federated model is best for the web, and some proponents of data portability suggest that Facebook Connect&#8217;s ability is <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/12/as-facebook-con.html">an effort to keep content proprietary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregation: Power.com offers a social portal</strong><br />
This <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/brazilian-social-networking-start-up-arrives-stateside/">Brazilian startup power.com </a>offers features that aggregate not only the social content being created, but also emails from other sources to centralize content to one source.  In Korean, I believe this is called a &#8220;home-pi&#8221;. (update, see comments for details, it&#8217;s actually a mini-home-pi)</p>
<p><strong>Music: YouTube to highlight classical artists</strong><br />
YouTube, the world&#8217;s most popular video online destination will <a href="http://www.techtree.com/India/News/YouTubes_Got_An_Ear_And_Eye_For_Music/551-95983-643.html">now try out music, starting with classical artists</a>.  Expect more experimentation and perhaps a way to extend YouTube&#8217;s on demand music playing features to other devices.</p>
<p><strong>Widgets: Ripe for marketers, but not used</strong><br />
This <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=132778">long article on AdAge gives examples and stats why widgets may work</a> for brands &#8211;and why adoption with marketers hasn&#8217;t seen a pickup.</p>
<p><strong>Identity: How to dupe friends on Social Networks</strong>This <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&#038;taxonomyName=internet_business&#038;articleId=9121578&#038;taxonomyId=71">article shows how easy it is to emulate friends on Facebook</a>, stealing folks identity in order to secretly get close to others.</p>
<p><strong>Culture: Charges against mother who victimized suicidal teen</strong><br />
The recent conviction of the mother who tricked a young team that committed suicide in MySpace has stirred advocates <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/11/in-the-wake-of.html">that there&#8217;s not enough being done for consumers in social networks</a> &#8211;esp teens.</p>
<p><strong>Culture: Croatian arrested for anti-government activity in social network</strong><br />
Not every culture is ready to embrace the two-way web, in fact, <a href="http://profy.com/2008/11/29/man-arrested-for-creating-a-facebook-group-in-croatia/">this man was arrested for creating a group aimed at debunking his government</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>VCs Seek Scalable Technologies</strong><br />
Lately, I&#8217;ve been spending time trading information with one of the most powerful groups in our industries: VCs.  They spur innovation by injecting funding into startups, help fuel those that need an accelerated path, and work many deals in the background to connect their investments with the right folks.<br />
<center><br />
<h2>[Although VCs seek investments that rapidly scale, startups must satisfy the needs of enterprise clients by offering a range of services]</center></h2>
<p>Yet despite their power I&#8217;m often concerned about one of goals that VCs have of their investments is finding and investing in a company that will quickly scale an an exponential rate then exiting.  Their vision is for technology to go from 1 person to 10 people to 100, 1000, 10k and so forth.  Then the opportunities for monetization and exit strategies are more at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Yet Enterprises Often Need Service Offerings</strong><br />
I understand why this model makes sense to VCs, but this is often the opposite model that enterprise class companies may need.  Some analysts approach the same industry from a different perspective.  I&#8217;m looking for companies that just won&#8217;t scale to reach millions of users, but companies that will help brands and users make a difference, yet often, this requires offering non-scalable offerings, like services.  </p>
<p><strong>The Conundrum of the Solution Startups</strong><br />
Take for example the community platform market, a space I&#8217;ve been covering for over a year and a half.  These vendors sell to large enterprise companies, yet the business case is far different.  To be successful in selling to the enterprise, vendors need to have a solution offering that includes services like: education, implementation, custom development, support, analytics services, and community management services.  When you couple these services with a technology offering (called a &#8217;solution sell&#8217;), you&#8217;re now able to provide value to large brands.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the challenge when vendors offer a solution to enterprises?  Services don&#8217;t scale in terms of revenue, it&#8217;s only an incremental growth in the top line incomes (2-10X).  As a result, some VCs may shy away from investments that are heavy services focus, and may instead encourage their portfolio companies to instead focus on scalable technologies.   </p>
<p><center><br />
<h2>[Often, social media implementation in the enterprise is 80% process and labor, and only 20% technology]</center></h2>
<p><strong>80/20 Rule of Services/Technology</strong><br />
In the end, you&#8217;re going to need both types of companies (scalable technology and solution partners) to help both businesses and users, in fact the most successful companies will often have both.  I often encourage my clients (large brands) to look at vendors beyond technology, in fact, most enterprise deployments of social media are only 20% technology and 80% process and labor.   So when you&#8217;re selecting a vendor, be sure to understand their roadmap, how their investors perceive the direction of the company, and take a long hard look at the services and support they can offer you.  </p>
<p>Note: I&#8217;ve also heard that some VCs are scaling back their investments in startups, while you continue to hear of funding happening for vendors. </p>
<p>Speaking of community platform vendors, I&#8217;ve submitted the community platform wave report to editing, and am anticipating a publish date in early Jan.</p>

First hand accounts <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/26/first-hand-accounts-of-terrorist-attacks-in-india-on-twitter/">were published on twitter, including pictures of terrorists in action</a>, in fact Forbes called this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2008/11/28/mumbai-twitter-sms-tech-internet-cx_bc_kn_1128mumbai.html">Mumbai: Twitter&#8217;s Moment</a>. Cities, authorities, states, and governments should have a social media plan in place to prepare for disasters of all sorts. <center><br />
<h2>[Social tools allow both true and false information to be rapidly communicated from sources in real time from anyone using a mobile device. During disasters this both enables and detracts emergency response.]</center></h2>
<p><strong>Social Tools Pervasive</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.forrester.com/Groundswell/profile_tool.html">Social Technographics</a> research indicates that these social tools are readily available and are being adopted in US, as well as other cultures. Any person connected to the internet, or has a mobile device has the ability to share information as well as scan and learn from their network, take for example this <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24727074-5007190,00.html">lawyer who used his blackberry to transmit emails while under siege in Mumbai</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Social Tools Spread Word of Mouth, both Good and Bad</strong> We&#8217;ve multiple accounts how individuals have used blogs, video, and now Twitter to rapidly spread information during a crises, from earthquakes in China, to Fires in L.A., to Hurricanes in the South, and now terrorist attacks in India. A hundred years ago, we would never imagine how information could spread so quickly. These tools are powerful, they allow anyone to share &#8211;and hear&#8211; information transmitted from others in real time from anywhere. We learned that both true and false information was being spread from these tools, in fact for days after this Mubai event rumors were still being settled. In fact, one of the concerns in this Mumai attack is that rumors were quickly spreading, and there was no central source to verify. In some cases, conversations in Twitter (and even the <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/11/23/retweet-the-infectious-power-of-the-word-of-mouth/">retweet</a>) can influence press, and therefore spread information to other locations impacting how emergency services could react. </p>
<p><strong>These Tools Enhance Existing Human Behaviors</strong> Gossip, the need to connect, and communication are natural human reactions during a crises. Like a scene at a freeway car crash, most want to know what&#8217;s happening and in the excitement, jump in to monitor and participate. <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/feeds/?p=339">Jennifer Leggio indicates that the good and bad of humans quickly show on these tools</a> &#8211;with mixed reactions. Amy Gahran provides us with why and<a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&#038;aid=154820"> how citizen journalists should react and behave</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Assume Terrorists Are Using Social Tools</strong> We learned that the Mumbai <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5099999/mumbai-terrorists-watch-world-react-with-horror-using-blackberrys">terrorists were using Blackberry&#8217;s to communicate and monitor</a>. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/11/29/2008-11-29_mumbai_terror_spree_the_work_of_only_10_.html">This 10 man crack commando team</a> was able to cause extensive havoc for 3 days. They were trained, funded, and had intelligence. Just as we should expect they are monitoring the police airways and public tv stations, we learned <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24726093-8362,00.html">they were monitoring online the &#8220;police responses on the internet&#8221;</a>. It&#8217;s so very easy to do, as people were tagging content <a href="http://stage-search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mumbai">#mumbai and it&#8217;s easily searchable by Twitter</a>. <center><br />
<h2>[Local governments, authorities, and response teams should understand how these social tools work, learn how to integrate into disaster response, and evaluate how they will use them during an emergency]</center></h2>
<hr /><strong>How Municipalities Should Integrate Social Media Into Disaster Planning</strong> Therefore, municipalities should learn from this tragic event, in order to understand, help reduce risk, and take advantage of the medium before an event happens.<br />
<blockquote>
<strong>1 Enhance Communication Plans:</strong> First of all, just as municipalities have an existing communication plan (often a press statement from police or authorities to media) understand how to repurpose these messages and communication on social tools. </p>
<p><strong>2 Experiment and Build a Base:</strong> Municipalities should experiment with the tools as we learned the <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2008/09/social-media-gl.html">Department of Homeland Security is understanding how to use these tools for disasters</a>, so cities should also start to monitor, then experiment. Just as we saw with Motrin moms, they had no base to stand on to defend themselves in Twitter &#8211;the same falls true for any ruling body. Having a platform in advance provides benefits, as those who participate have power. </p>
<p><strong>3 Educate, Train, and build Awareness Before an Event. </strong> Governing bodies often have mock emergency response trials, now, start to incorporate these tools into the planning process. You&#8217;ll have to indicate to the world what is an official channel, where people should go for news, and how each authority plans to respond using these tools. These tools can help educate citizens how to prepare for disasters, where to go for help, how to develop a family crises plan, and even basic life saving medical techniques. </p>
<p><strong>4 Develop a Crisis plan:</strong> It&#8217;s far to bold to suggest that each governing body use these tools during an emergency. Perhaps they are focused on keeping information quiet in order to save lives, are unaware of what the truth is, or simply don&#8217;t have the resources. Even so, municipalities should expect information to rapidly spread amongst those witnessing the tragedy, and commented by others. Likely, like a triage plan, a similar plan for social media should be created depending on the type of disaster occurring. </p>
<p><strong>5 Use These Tools To Rebuild:</strong> Even if the municipality chooses not to participate during the crises, these tools can help rebuild after the tragedy. The Red Cross has been using blogs, Facebook causes, twitter, and a variety of other tools to help spread awareness to drive donations, and to get people involved.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been one busy year for me, I&#8217;ve traveled the country and world to meet and talk about social media.  Just about every city I visit, I try to attend a social media meetup or host my own, to date, I&#8217;ve participated in tweetups in Alexandria, Barcelona, Tampa, Oahu, Tokyo, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Dallas, and Boston (twice).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Tweetup?  A few years ago, we called them blogger dinners, and it&#8217;s where folks got to come together, meet each other face to face (scary huh?) and actually talk in real life.  Despite the affection many have for these social tools, there is nothing like seeing people in real life and meeting them.</p>
<p>A few guidelines for social events that I mentioned on twitter:  Unlike Fight Club, talk about Tweetups, before, during, and after.  Come to meet folks, be social.  Don&#8217;t &#8220;poke&#8221; anyone unless you&#8217;ve brought protection. The act of &#8220;throwing sheep&#8221; at anyone other than your spouse is not encouraged.  If you&#8217;re going to mention people &#8220;you&#8217;re following them&#8221; be sure to give them context whether that&#8217;s on Twitter or in real life &#8211;hopefully the former.  </p>
<p>Kidding aside, just come to network with others, buy someone you&#8217;re connected to online a drink, exchange real world information, and most importantly, be merry.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve neglected my own hometown, I&#8217;ve decided to organize a tweetup on Thur, Dec 11th (things hopefully have settled down for many of us during the holidays) in the Peninsula.  I&#8217;ll find a bar suitable for a social gathering, and make sure it&#8217;s close to freeways or Caltrain.  </p>
<p><strong>Event Details</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What</strong>: <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1402321/">Silicon Valley Tweetup (RSVP on Upcoming)</a><br />
<strong>Tag</strong>: #svtweetup<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: Thursday, Dec 11th, 2008<br />
<strong>Time</strong>: 6pm<br />
<strong>What to expect:</strong> This is a no-host event, so you should buy a drink for someone you don&#8217;t know, groups can walk to local restaurants after tweetup.<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: TBD (I&#8217;m working on a venue, will make it near public transportation)</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m respecting your limited time by publishing this weekly digest on the Social Networking space, which I cover as an industry analyst. By creating this digest (I started this over a year ago) it really helps me to stay on top of the space I cover.</p>
<p>I’ve created a new category called <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/digest/">Digest (view archives)</a>. Start with the Web Strategy Summary, then quickly scan the succinct and categorized headlines, read text for my take, and click link to dive in for more.  </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Web Strategy Summary</strong><br />
Facebook reportadly in talks with Twitter, yet the deal did not go through, Kickapps raises a hefty &#8220;C&#8221; round of finance for $14mm, and more niche social networks launch, this one for the affluent gay market and ailing.  YouTube launches &#8220;live video&#8221; streaming and MySpace couples with Guns and Roses for web launch.<br />
<hr />
<p><strong>Stats: Collection of Social Network Stats</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve started to aggregate stats of all kinds, growth, revenue, demographics, website usage, and more on this page of <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/11/19/social-networks-site-usage-visitors-members-page-views-and-engagement-by-the-numbers-in-2008/">Social Networks Site Usage: Visitors, Members, Page Views, and Engagement by the Numbers in 2008</a>.  Bookmark it, and share it with others as I continue to update it.</p>
<p><strong>No Deal: Facebook was in talks with Twitter</strong><br />
Kara Swisher uncovers a story about <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081124/when-twitter-met-facebook-the-acquisition-deal-that-fail-whaled/">Facebook in talks with Twitter, yet no more</a>, which they didn&#8217;t admit in public when probed.  Some suspect exit strategy of overvalued equity a concern.</p>
<p><strong>Funding: Kickapps Raises $14mm</strong><br />
This <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/25/kickapps-actually-raises-14-million-in-a-series-b/">C round of $14mm</a> should hold Kickapps through much of the economic downturn if they invest it correctly as well as bank some capital away.  </p>
<p><strong>Advertising: Baidu withdraws advertising from alleged scammers</strong><br />
Baidu apologizes for publishing <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/19/baidu_medical_scam/">ads from unlicensed medical practioners which critics call scams</a>. I guess in this case the messenger has a responsibility to provide quality advertising.  </p>
<p><strong>Video: Scoble interviews Context Optional</strong><br />
The famous video blogger <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/11/26/social-network-advertising-not-your-fathers-banner-ad/">Robert Scoble interviews Kevin Barenblat’s of Context Optional</a> to discuss how advertisements are now becoming interactive ads, <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/6118-scobleizer/279565-social-network-advertising-part-i">watch the 6 min video to get the short</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers: LinkedIn Stats from CEO</strong><br />
8 million to more than 30 million, while the staff has expanded from 60 to 370 employees, CEO alludes (but doesnt confirm nor deny) that revenues are $75 (million) to $100 million <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/22/BUAI141O97.DTL">says this interview with SFgate</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise 2.0: Social Networks not ready for business?</strong><br />
This article weighs the different viewpoints from business leaders about the opportunities for social networks within the enterprise.  Although we see rabid adoption among consumers, is there value inside of the firewall?  <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3786921/Social+Networks+Not+Ready+for+Business.htm">Read more to understand different opinions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verticals: Social Network for Gays and Businesses</strong><br />
GayWallet launches, in hopes of <a href="http://www.gaywired.com/Article.cfm?ID=20972">connecting the affluent gay market with companies</a> what want to cater to their community.  We continue to see niche social networks for every walk of life and interest.</p>
<p><strong>Media: MySpace launches Guns and Roses latest album</strong><br />
Gaining lots of attention, Mr Rose launches his overdue album on social network MySpace which caters to a strong self-expression and media hungry audience.  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gunsnroses">See the MySpace page </a>which today has 75 million listens and 441k friends.  To put this into perspective some of the top selling albums (sure a different medium) <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0151020.html">had 29 million album buys</a> &#8211;Eagles.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical: Social Network for sick and dying</strong><br />
More niche players emerge as this one for the ailing called <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-1831-SF-Web-20-Examiner~y2008m11d21-A-social-network-for-the-sick-and-dying">caring bridge launches, the examiner has the story</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization: Facebook shows off it&#8217;s global data</strong><br />
Global thermonuclear war?  Wargames?  Not quite, Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=37403547074&#038;ref=nf">latest featured video shows off all the data</a> that&#8217;s being created in the world on it&#8217;s platform, and how it&#8217;s shared.  Trippy.</p>
<p><strong>Video: YouTube Live makes video real time</strong><br />
Google&#8217;s YouTube launched a live show to showcase <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Celebrities-YouTube-Users-Come-Together/story.aspx?guid={5F326FA3-8CAA-480B-9BA8-AA8AB4CEC91E}">top performers and video bloggers in this first ever stream</a>.  Expect YouTube to take a more center stage in the family room experience &#8211;they also launched a wide screen player, a first step to going HD.</p>
<p><strong>Research: Users on Social Networks but advertising &#8220;Anemic&#8221;</strong><br />
A recent IDC reports that there&#8217;s strong usage of <a href="http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/digital-downloads/broadband/e3ibc6a46a48b7615cb0c77e24b4c1eb1ef">consumers using these social networks, but brand advertising is still a miss</a>.  Yup, but we have to remember there are multiple ways to approach social netwroks, and the first way should be community marketing, which means being a resource to them and talking with them &#8211;not at them.</p>
<p><strong>Etiqutte: Facebook Do&#8217;s and Dont&#8217;s</strong><br />
Forget polishing school for your Saturday supper clubs, now it&#8217;s time to pay attention to social network behavior, this polite guide <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/154374/facebook_etiquette.html?tk=rss_news">gives the top five dos and donts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising Network: Glam media launches widget network</strong><br />
Some say that interactive widgets show higher engagement and interaction that traditional ads and <a href="http://glammedia.com/about_glam/news/2008/11/18/glam-media-launches-glam-applications-network-with-more-than-50-charter-widget-and-application-developers-and-media-companies">Glam Media is rolling out a widget advertising network across 50 of it&#8217;s properties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Culture: Examples of people being &#8220;Stupid&#8221; on social networks</strong><br />
What happens in the lockerroom doesn&#8217;t belong on social networks, read these three examples of some real winners, in &#8220;<a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Social-Networking-Rule-No-1-Dont-Be-Stupid-65215.html">don&#8217;t be stupid</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob Pearson (Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/bobpdell">bobpdell</a>) Vice President, Communities &#038; Conversations at Dell invited me out to Microsoft&#8217;s Architect Forum to co-lead a session on social computing.</p>
<p>I let my twitter community come up with questions, and I took three from the dozens to pose to Bob, select questions from: <a href="http://prmeetsmarketing.wordpress.com/">Cece Salomon-Lee</a>, <a href="http://www.ustrategy.com/">Ravit Lichtenberg</a>, and oemporor (can&#8217;t find his tweet)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the questions I posed to Bob, if I could only spit the words out as well as I could write them:</p>
<blockquote>
<li>Is IdeaStorm increasing revenues?</li>
<li>Is social media impacting the bottom and top line of Dell?</li>
<li>How Dell has made $1mm in revenue from Twitter.</li>
<li>Is social media superficial branding, or does it truly change the company?</li>
<li>How does an economic downturn impact Dell&#8217;s social media efforts?</li>
<li>Is it better for customers to self-support each other rather than calling Dell Support?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the URL of your corporate webpage?</li>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s great to learn first hand from Dell how they&#8217;ve used these tools to increase revenues and reduce costs &#8211;it&#8217;s time we focus on the business aspect of things rather than the feel good branding only.  You can see one of Bob&#8217;s <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/blogs/direct2dell/archive/2008/11/14/techknowledge-a-conversation-with-umesh-ramakrishnan.aspx">recent video interviews</a> on the Direct 2 Dell site.</p>
