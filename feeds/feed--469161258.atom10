			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesus told us to go into all the world and make disciples</p>
<p>GOD the Spirit indwells us, empowering us, teaching us, leading us</p>
<p>We have been given Authority by Jesus to do the things he did</p>
<p>YOU a simple person, one individual, you CAN change the world</p>
<p>Simply step into the flow of what God is doing.  If you have ears, listen.  If you have eyes, see.  God is prodding you to service.  In fact he has already prepared in advance everything you will need to take part in what he is doing. You may not realize it, but a simple act of love or kindness, the simple act of allowing Gods love to flow through you can change a life.</p>

<p>We are in the process of &#8220;adopting&#8221; an orphanage in Ethiopia.  This isnt like an adoption center here in the States with young couples waiting in line to adopt the children.  These are kids whos parents have died of AIDS, starvation, malaria or one of many other diseases.  Their are no young couples waiting in line to adopt them.  They struggle each day to find enough food to sustain life.  Imagine being ten years old, both parents die, and you are left as head of your household with three younger siblings, in a country already overwhelmed with orphans.  What do you do?  Anything it takes to survive.  Many times the thing it takes to survive is the very thing that leads to death as young girls sell them selves as sexual toys to get enough food to eat, only to eventually contract the diseases that took their parents in the first place.</p>
<p>But you CAN do something.  You CAN change the world.  As we step into this God thing and begin to touch the lives of these young boys and girls, we can effect the future of Africa.  Touching one life, bringing the unconditional love of God, introducing Jesus Christ as savior can dramatically change life.  Not only that one person but everyone around them.</p>
<p>So Im asking you, do something.  Anything.  Even if its in your own neighborhood and not in Ethiopia.  The church can no long sit back and wait for the world to become a better place.  We are the light.  Its our responsibility to carry it into the darkness.  If you will just be the church, be the person God is calling you to be, the world WILL be changed.</p>
<p>If you dont know what to do or where to begin, feel free to email me.  Tell someone about your desire.  Maybe you can begin with <a href="http://www.hopechest.org/">Childrens Hope Chest</a>.  This is the organization we are partnering with to go to Ethiopia.  Or <a href="http://www.5for50.com/">http://www.5for50.com/</a>Just begin moving.  God will show you as you go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Article previously published at <a title="eZine" href="http://www.wreckedfortheordinary.com/category.asp?category=simplicity&amp;filename=willys-light" target="_blank">http://www.wreckedfortheordinary.com</a></em></p>
<p><em>(I know thats cheating&#8230; but I just havent had time to write so I thought I would post the article I wrote to at least have something new. ) </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I met Willy almost a year ago. Willy has been homeless for some time now. Recently he came up and pulled me out of the group saying, &#8220;Hey Rev, come over here. I need to tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>I walked off to the side of the crowd with Willy and he began to tell me his story: &#8220;I just wanted to come over here because I didn’t want people to think I was prideful or anything, but,&#8221; he said as his voice lowered and he leaned into me so only I could hear. &#8220;I have my own room.&#8221; He paused so I could let the significance of the statement set in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your own room?&#8221; I asked back.</p>
<p>He nodded and continued: &#8220;It’s been amazing. For the last two nights I have actually slept in a bed. You know, I usually just sleep on the concrete. But not last night or the night before. I have a bed now. I was at the Department of Labor the other day looking for work and all morning I was passed up. No one wanted or needed me. But I just felt like God was telling me to wait. I fell asleep waiting but late that afternoon a man comes over and wakes me up and asks do I want to work. Of course I do. And I’ve been working for him since. So my room, not only do I have a bed, but I have a ceiling fan, too. That’s right, it works and everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>A huge smile formed on his face and his eyes began to sparkle. &#8220;You know what’s best of all? I have my own light. My own light! Can you believe it? It’s great. My own light!&#8221;</p>
<p>The excitement was simply flowing out of him as he explained how he would give up the bed, the fan and sleep on concrete in a hot room as long as he could keep the light. His own light. He winked and slapped his hand on his knee to emphasize joy stating, &#8220;And you know what Rev? I’ll be sleeping there tonight!&#8221; Our conversation continued for another ten minutes as he credited God for the entire thing: the job, the bed, and even his light.</p>
<p>I love hearing stories of how God reaches into a person’s life, right where they are, and gives them hope and meaning. I have pondered Willy’s light over the past few days and I cannot help but draw a parallel to my light. I am not referring to the one in my room or my kitchen or even the one I take for granted in the bathroom. I mean the light that God has given me.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &#8220;You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.&#8221; When you become one of these &#8220;sons of light,&#8221; an amazing thing happens. You actually become the light. Rather than just being in the light or from the light, you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> the light.</p>
<p>This causes me to wonder how important my light is to me? How important is your light to you? Is it more important than daily comfort? If a choice had to be made between showing the light and sleeping on the concrete or hiding it to stay in a comfy bed, which would be chosen?</p>
<p>I believe that each day, we are given the choice to display our light. God places people in our paths who are living in a land of darkness and hopelessness or the edge of eternal death. Sometimes all it takes is one small light to bring back hope and life. This small light could be a smile, a hug, a quarter or the hamburger just picked up at the drive through. At other times it is a simple hello. Sometimes all it takes is for us to be light.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through my journey as a follower of Christ I have gone back and forth on the idea of eternal security.  For those of you who don’t know, that’s basically the idea that once you are saved, you are always saved.  Nothing can ever take it away from you.</p>
<p>At one time I believed that unwaveringly.  Well because that’s what I was always taught!  And at one time I believed I had to earn salvation.  That it was the way I lived, the things I did that somehow earned me favor and salvation with God.  I mean for those staunch believers in eternal security, if your life suddenly turned to crap and you started to slip away and fall into sin…. (They call that a backslider btw)… WELL then, you MUST not have REALLY been saved in the first place.  Otherwise you wouldn’t be living that way.  Because you are obviously not saved, just look at your sin as evidence of that.</p>
<p>Then there are those who believe, well, I am free to live how I want.  To do what I want, to sin how I want, as long as I repent and ask God for forgiveness… then hey… Im good.</p>
<p>Both those are off if ya ask me.</p>
<p>Ok… so what DO I believe about the once saved always saved doctrine?  Well… I believe that once you have accepted the gift of Jesus Christ.  You believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord… well… then you are saved.  Nothing can take that away from you.  The devil cant snatch it out from under you.  Your spouse cant, your preacher cant, angels cant, demons cant, circumstances cant… nothing can separate you….  but you.  I believe God simply will not trump free will.  He gives us the choice to love and follow him.  So I do believe… once your saved… well your saved… but you can give it back.</p>
<p>Well, this isn’t the post to give scripture reference and proof text to explain why I believe what I believe about eternal security and salvation.  I guess I only bring all that up to help define what I mean by the word saint.  As I look through the bible, particularly at how Paul starts most of his letters, I begin to see a definition for what it is to be a saint.  Its not as much about the way you live your life, as it is your belief in Jesus as the Lord.</p>
<p>Let me show you:</p>
<blockquote><p>Romans 1<br />
Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David, and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. Through him and for his name&#8217;s sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.<br />
 To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:<br />
      Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>1 Corinthians<br />
Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,<br />
To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:<br />
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok so he didn’t use the word SAINT here… but he said those sanctified in Christ Jesus. But that describes those believers in Corinth.  Then in 2 Corinthians he opens with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,<br />
      To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:<br />
 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Ephesians 1<br />
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,<br />
      To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:<br />
 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you begin to get the idea of what a saint is?  Oh and by the way… Did you notice Paul is always about Grace and Peace from God…  even when he’s about to spank you with truth…</p>
<p>So anyway… a saint, called to belong to Jesus, believing in the resurrection of Jesus, faithful in Christ Jesus, they call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord.</p>
<p>So what is this sainthood?  Seems to me, he is using the term to describe those who are saved.  Yes, there is some measure of faithfulness and living righteously, but I believe that stems from being a saint, not what defines you as a saint.  You know? So then a saint is one who has received the gift of salvation from God through belief in the redemptive death and resurrection of his son Jesus.</p>
<p>OK… so to go from there.  Are then all saints disciples?  I mean what did Jesus command the church at the end of the book of Matthew?  </p>
<p>Then Jesus came to them and said, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&#8221;</p>
<p>That’s a pretty big commision, eh.  Almost great even…</p>
<p>So, what do many churches do with that today?  Well it’s the basis for the evangelistic outreach programs.  For the big conferences where a great dynamic speaker brings a powerful and anointed word of God and hundreds of people come forth and receive Jesus as their savior.  Then… they are off to the next big conference to save some more of the lost.</p>
<p>But wait a second, didn’t he say… Go and make disciples?  Not just go and make saints or go and get people saved?  Because really&#8230; we dont make saints&#8230;</p>
<p>In the book of John Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</p>
<p>He also talks about his yoke and how it is not heavy… well what the heck does that mean, right?  I mean, are they small eggs, with lighter yokes?  Ummm no.  To try and keep it short… I am getting rather long I see… That was a term used back then to describe a lifestyle and teaching.  As students began to learn under a rabbi, or as they became his disciple, they went everywhere together.  They began to think like he thought, they began to live like he lived, they began to take on the belief set and lifestyle characteristics of their teacher… that was called his yoke.</p>
<p>So then, to be a disciple, is more than simply being a saint.  You see, I believe you can be a saint, you can be saved, going to heaven and all that, and yet, not be a disciple.  Being a disciple is something you have to choose during each phase of your journey with him.  You see along your walk with God he will continually challenge you and bring you into a deeper relationship a bigger space.  The more you walk with him, the more you take on his yoke. </p>
<p>But this is a continuing process.  Just as with all disciples or students, some lessons are easier learned and sometimes you have to go to summer school, five or six times…   I also believe you may be a disciple for one phase of your life, but decide to drop out of school.  Does this mean you are no longer a saint?  Heck no, it just means you are no longer a disciple.</p>
<p>But let me tell you a lie the enemy will feed you….  “Look back on your life… remember how great it was when you were following him, living every moment for him.  But now…  NOW you sinner, after what you have done… how can you expect him to still love you.  I mean compared to how you were then… and how you are now… forget about it! You dropped out of school remember?  That door is closed… you are lost now… so you may as well follow me, you’ve already gone to far for his goodie two shoe school… you’ve already blown it, so you may as well go all out…”</p>
<p>Don’t listen to it.  That’s a lie.  Simply because you have chosen to no longer be a disciple of Christ does not remove you from the ranks of the saints.  You are still the chosen of God.  You are still the child he loved then and still loves.  So what ever you do, don’t ever believe that its too late for you.  Its truly as simple as reenrolling in school and choosing to become a disciple again.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[So I’ve been pondering something I read in 2 Corinthians (12:7), where Paul said “To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I’ve been pondering something I read in 2 Corinthians (12:7), where Paul said <em>“To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.”</em></p>
<p>So I’m wondering.  Does God always couple great revelation with thorns?</p>
<p>How do you begin even discovering that?  Well… you look in the bible I would think.  Its great how it allows you to see a persons life from the outside, you can see their struggles and how God worked through them and in them.</p>
<p>So where to begin…  Im thinking Hebrews 11… the Hall of Faith as they say.</p>
<p>It begins like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.</p></blockquote>
<p>So over the next few days Im going to take a look at these guys… did they all have thorns?  Did they recognize they had them? Did they ask God to remove them?</p>
<p>Way back when, when I actually wrote consistently I would have had several people commenting with replies… But as it is with most blogs where the writer seemingly drops of the face of the blogosphere… the readers go to.  But, if anyone is still reading, and you feel so inclined, take a look at these guys life and tell me what you think.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick list if you don’t want to go to Hebrews 11 to look them up:</p>
<p>Enoch<br />
Noah<br />
Abraham<br />
Isaac<br />
Jacob<br />
Joseph<br />
Moses<br />
The People<br />
Rehab<br />
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets</p>
<p>Ok… that’s it I think.  Of course, this is just a place to begin.  After all the question is does God couple great revelation with thorns.  So that doesn’t necessarily mean having great faith means you have received great revelation, does it? </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been incredibly busy of late… As you may already know, Im in the middle of building my house.  Not just paying to have a house built for me, but rather doing as much of the work as possible.  My brother is here from Seattle and has pretty much framed it by himself with mine and my sons help on the weekends and any days I can get off.  I have a little over a week of leave left that Im saving for when he gets to the ceiling, the part that will really be hard to do alone.  And Im acting as the general contractor, selecting and hiring all the required sub-contractors, making sure all the permits are in order, getting the right insurance…  and honestly… the house is going great.  No real set backs at all.  Just a few small things that were corrected within a couple days.</p>
<p>God has truly been blessing this entire adventure.  Heck, our outside sales rep from the building supply place is a bi-vocational pastor and he has gone way out of the way to make sure things flow.</p>
<p>Then there’s church… you see God placed in me this passion to reach people who don’t know him.  And yet… I really don’t like talking to people.  I suffer from a bit of social anxiety.  When I think of having to go to a newcomers lunch and having to sit at a table with a bunch of people I don’t know… well… I just REALLY don’t want to go.  But I know. God places people in my life, all around me, that need to know who he is and his love begins to swell up  inside me and he gives me the words to say, he gives me the opportunities…  Its actually quite amazing really.</p>
<p>For the past 5 years I have been praying for my church.  You see, as soon as I became a member I felt we were missing it.  I mean, we have been reaching people, we have been searching for God, following God, amazing things have been happening.  From the very beginning of my time there I have been praying for a more intentional focus on the lost.  In fact, the way I view ministry and evangelism has been a point of tension between me and some of the people who use to be on staff.</p>
<p>I wanted to move the college service off campus.  My thoughts being… we can no longer sit in church and wait for people to come.  We need to go where people are that need him.  Heck you can look over the last 5 years of my blog and see that I think.  I started a servant evangelism thing that was amazing, people got totally excited… yet there wasn’t a buy in from the church staff… so it didn’t go anywhere.  Our college group moved our meeting to the middle of the street in downtown Macon and it has become an amazing thing.  For years I have prayed for my church to see this facet of ministry.  To see that it truly is a foundational thing that we have not been doing.  And you know… the entire vision of the church has shifted…  My prayer has been answered…  God is totally awesome. </p>
<p>My job is great.  I love where I work.  Its totally flexible and fits well with my ministry.  It is a huge resource to help with my ministry.  My boss is a believer and is a great person to bounce ideas off of.  The leave is good, the benefits are great… its an awesome job.</p>
<p>And yet… theres still that thorn…</p>
<p>Im laying here unable to sleep at 1 AM praying that God would just remove it from me.  God please take this thorn from my side.  Why do I have to have this?  I mean God TOTALLY answers my prayers.  He TOTALLY blesses anything I lay my hands to do. (When I ask him first what is is Im suppose to be doing that is) </p>
<p>And yet… theres still a thorn…</p>
<p>I’ve read 2 Chor where Paul talks about his.  HE asked three times for it to be removed… and was finally able to receive that Gods Grace is sufficient.  You know, I totally receive that in almost all facets of my life.  I don’t worry about things.  I most the time do approach life and situations with a childlike faith in God, knowing that no matter what… he is there… his Grace will simply do…  I mean, I don’t struggle with that, I know God is God, there is no doubt because I have seen him, heard him, talked to him, been hugged by him, been in arguments with him, Im in love with God.  I cant get enough God.  And yet… theres this thorn and for some strange reason I cant just let it go.  I cant seem to let his grace cover it like I do every other thing in my life. </p>
<p>Is it the devil?  Is it a messenger from satan come to torment me like Paul said his was?  Is it to keep me humble?  I mean, I KNOW that it is God working through me, its him doing all the amazing things in my church, in my ministry, in my life…  So do I need this thing to keep me from boasting in myself? To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations?</p>
<p>I mean, theres like this inside joke I have with a couple people from the college group.  People I trust and share more personal things with…  Its hard to explain really… but one of them said once… its like your three years ahead… the stuff you are talking about… and wanting to happen… its like no one sees it or hears it… but your talking about it… are passionate about it… then three years later BAM… they see it… but forgot that you have been talking about it for three years. </p>
<p>When we were talking about making some video commercials for the college group one of them said…  “Oh I know… we should have Pastor Brian make this profound statement about something… maybe about the downtown thing… then have everyone just look at him and stare… then have someone else say the exact same thing… and everyone get all excited and clap… like that commercial…  He says… I just said that… yeah but you went like this.. and he went like that…”</p>
<p>So does God give me great revelation and them temper it with thorns????</p>
<p>I don’t know… and now Im sort of rambling and this post is huge… BUT… I feel better having just said it out loud.  Amazing how that works.  Even just if its saying out loud in an empty room with written words.  Somehow it makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>One thing I’m totally thankful of is the prayer Paul had for the people or Corinth at the end of his letter….  “May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.”</p>
<p>I love having the grace, love and fellowship of God.  Without that… man, life would just suck</p>
<p>(btw, forgive the typos or loss of thought&#8230; given the hour I have choosento simply type my thoughts as I had them with no proof reading.. we&#8217;ll see tomorrow.. or rather later today&#8230; if I even made sense)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve discovered since I started this sky watch thing&#8230; well&#8230; I have really been watching the sky a lot more.  Have you done that lately?  I mean, just look at the sky.  Its really quite amazing.  Many times the soft floating clouds appear to be a water color print painted on the horizon by God.  You should try it.  This week.  Everyday simply take some time and enjoy the sky.</p>
<p>I have two sky pictures this week.  The first one was taken as my brother and I went out to my lot.  We are about to begin construction on my new home and I brought him out there to show him were the house will be, the well, the septic tank&#8230; that sort of thing&#8230;  When we walked down to the edge of the water I glanced up and was like&#8230; wow&#8230; what a great view&#8230;  that would make a good Sky Watch picture.   Sooo here it is.</p>

<p>This next one, I was driving down the road on the way to church Wednesday night, the sun was coming in and out from behind the clouds and when I stopped at a light, I decided to snap a shot from the drivers side window.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I began my day with a cold shower&#8230; (Our water heater has decided to turn off for some reason during the night) Which in turn made my shower shorter than usual.  This brought me to a cup of coffee and the bible.</p>
<p>Rachelle sent a txt not long ago referencing 2 Peter, so I decided to begin there.  I&#8217;m reading through, nodding in agreement,  Basically, be sure of who you are in Christ, of your calling&#8230; strive to follow the spirit in your daily life and if you do these things&#8230; you will never fail.</p>
<p>And the proclamation of a Majestic God declaring Jesus as His son. Then it moves on to false prophets, false teachers, people who speak about truth and life but live in death, walking in the flesh rather than the spirit.  Woe to the one who turns the weak away from God.  Woe to the one who uses his power of influence and smooth talk to charm away the weak, the hurting. And woe to the one who once knew God, who claimed to know Jesus then later purposely turned away.</p>
<p>With thoughts of 2 Peter running through my mind I begin the drive to work.  Listening to a harp and bowl session from IHOP Kansas City.   Thoughts of what if I have become a false prophet, a false teacher&#8230;  What about the impure thoughts that run through my mind&#8230;  The constant pressing of the flesh into my thoughts&#8230;  Am I speaking truth and life and yet allowing a portion of my mind to live in death, in lust, in deception?</p>
<p>Forgive me Lord.  Became my prayer.<br />
Entering in to a time of prayer, seeking God, again crying out for his revelation.  For the revelation of Jesus.  The cd simply becoming one part of this moment with God.  Praying and singing, not simply echoing the words, but praying and singing, interacting with God.</p>
<p>His love filling the air around me, me responding in love.  I realize Im crying, and smiling, and singing, and simply worshiping God as I drive down the road.  Simply interacting with a divine moment.</p>
<p>I love God, I truly do</p>
<p>Sometimes he seems so far away.  So distant and silent.  Maybe I try too hard to hear Him, to sense and feel His presence.  Maybe I dont try often enough. Maybe its me, my life that is in the way, I dont know.  But this morning, I interacting with God.  Not just a prayer to him, not just a revelation from him, a conversation, a special moment that he reserved especially for me. </p>
<p>If you feel God moving close to you, dont run away.  Dont hide in your failings.  Dont allow thoughts of your shortcommings to interrupt.  Simply open your heart, allow his forgiveness in and enter in to a divine interaction with God.</p>
