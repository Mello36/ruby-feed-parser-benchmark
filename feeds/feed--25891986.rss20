	<description>Think of me as a real, creative and sometimes accidentally comedic character. I exist because of my passion for life and my urge to share and teach. I am a movie loving, finance practicing, web entrepreneur as well as a website making code addict. But, that???s not all. I am part cook, part party addict, mostly foreign and almost always cool.</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Graduation</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/grad.jpg" class="lefty" height="227" width="287" />A week and a half ago, I finally reached a major milestone in my life, I graduated from <a href="http://www.pitt.edu" target="_blank">college</a>. Last four years flew by and I enjoyed every single year. From studying, to partying, to playing sports and being competitive, I will miss it all (that&#8217;s clearly an overstatement). I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree with concentration in Finance. The whole world is open now with enormous opportunities, which I look forward to take on.</p>
<p>Life after college is not without stress though. I&#8217;ve taken two months off before starting full-time at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a> during which there&#8217;s so much to do before I embark on the next chapter of my life. Still during this short time frame, I&#8217;ve got a few freelance projects to take care of on top of about three planned 1-week-long trips before Mandy and I move for good to San Francisco.</p>
<h2>Upcoming trips</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/barcelona.jpg" class="righty" height="199" width="249" />Next week, I need to get to New York to get a Visa so that I can travel to Spain in late-June. If I end up flying to NYC, that&#8217;s one roundtrip flight, or two individual flights, or <strong>2 total</strong> so far. Throw Spain in that count and we&#8217;re up to <strong>4</strong> already.</p>
<p>Next friday, Mandy, her parents and I are going to Orlando for a week. I&#8217;m looking forward to Florida, but it&#8217;s 80 degrees every day here in Pittsburgh (crazy surprise if you know Pittsburgh weather), so I don&#8217;t even want to think about the heat in Florida. The count is up to <strong>6</strong> now.</p>
<p>Before we move for good, Mandy and I would like to fly to San Francisco and start looking for apartments (a lengthy process from what I understand). If by any luck we find a nice place within that one week, that would be ideal. Mandy also wants to start interviewing at veterinary hospitals while we&#8217;re there. Currently, we&#8217;re trying to work this trip out with the relocation folks. The count is up to <strong>8</strong> if we end up going.</p>
<p>July 2nd is when we&#8217;re planning to move for good. This one-way flight will officially kick off this next chapter of my life I mentioned earlier. I&#8217;m not scared at all as I&#8217;ll have Mandy next to me the whole time through this experience (plus a lot of helpful people on the other side of U.S.) The tally is up to <strong>9</strong>.</p>
<p>Stressful? Very, but it&#8217;s all manageable as long we stay healthy, which I&#8217;m not right now, so I&#8217;ll stop right here.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.virb.com/dimitry" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/virbtwitter.png" alt="Twitter on Virb" class="lefty" width="323" height="172" border="0" /></a>First, let me begin by apologizing for putting <a href="http://www.virb.com" target="_blank">Virb</a> and MySpace in one sentence. That won&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>Last week, I came up with a quick solution to include my Twitter status on my Virb profile. This way, all my info is consolidated nicely within one profile. For now, Virb makes this a bit hard because Javascript cannot be included in profiles and rightfully so!</p>
<p>So, to get around that, I simply decided to have my web server query my Twitter status from time to time (every 10-15 minutes) and if there&#8217;s a change, create a new image accordingly. The image is then simply plugged into my Virb profile and loaded from my server upon every viewing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> PHP 5 (or PHP 4 with a custom JSON module) with both GD library and FreeType compiled with it. Most hosting companies will have both available. If not, ask them. You may not even need FreeType if you decide to use one of few built in fonts (ugly). FreeType is needed to be able to use custom fonts when generating custom images using the GD library.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Step 1 - Get the data</h2>
<p>We first need to get the data from Twitter and they make it easy enough with <a href="http://twitter.com/help/api" target="_blank">two options</a>: <abbr title="Javascript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> and XML. Being a Javascript developer, I swear by JSON and since <a href="www.php.net/json" target="_blank">PHP 5</a> has all the necessary functionality built in to parse a JSON string, let&#8217;s use that.</p>
<pre>
$url = 'http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/771362.json'; // Get the JSON URL to your account

$curl_handle = curl_init(); // Open up a CURL connection
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_URL, "$url");
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 2); // Timeout connecting in 2 seconds
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 20); // Timeout getting data in 20 seconds (since Twitter has been slow with growing popularity)
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // Get data back

$buffer = curl_exec($curl_handle); // Execute the request and get data back
curl_close($curl_handle); // Close the connection!

if ($buffer) { // If data is returned
	$data = json_decode($buffer); // Decode JSON string

	$twitter_when = date('n/j/Y g:ia',abs(strtotime($data[0]->created_at . " GMT"))); // When was last tweet posted?
	$twitter_text = $data[0]->text; // Last tweet
} else { // Otherwise
	die("Couldn't fetch data"); // Error occurred while fetching, most likely a timeout
}
</pre>
<p>We now have the time of the last tweet and the actual tweet in variables <strong>$twitter_when</strong> (UNIX timestamp) and <strong>$twitter_text</strong> respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to update <strong>$url</strong> variable to have your userid (mine is &#8216;771362&#8242;). It&#8217;s tricky to find it out on Twitter. I will post an update when I figure out a good way to do so.</p>
<h2>Step 2 - Generate the image</h2>
<p>We need a way to display this new data on Virb and since no Javascript is allowed, we will generate a new image with this content and then include the image in our Virb profiles.</p>
<pre>
//$im = imagecreatetruecolor(560, 72); // Uncomment this and delete the next line to create a blank image
$im = imagecreatefrompng("virb.png"); // This creates an image from an existing PNG image

$white = imagecolorallocate($im, 173, 173, 173); // Define some colors to use
$grey = imagecolorallocate($im, 100, 100, 100); // Color for side the date/time

$twitter_text = wordwrap($twitter_text,72); // Because my image is only 560 pixels wide, text can run out of the boundaries and GD library has nothing to remedy that, so this function will wrap the text after 72 characters. This may differ for your image.

$font = 'SomeFont.otf'; // Custom font. You may use one of four or five standard fonts, but they're ugly

imagefttext($im, 10, 0, 10, 20, $white, $font, $twitter_text, array('linespacing'=>1.7)); // Write out to the image Twitter status with appropriate positioning
imagefttext($im, 9, 0, 11, 61, $grey, $font, $twitter_when, array('linespacing'=>1.7)); // Same with date/time of last tweet

imagepng($im,"twitter.png"); // Create twitter.png
imagedestroy($im); // Free up some memory
</pre>
<p>We now have an image that was generated on the fly by PHP that includes our last tweet. This image can now be safely included anywhere you&#8217;d like, even your website.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t go into describing the functionality of each function and its parameters, so make sure you look them up on <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">php.net</a> for better reference.</p>
<h2>Step 3 - Run the final script recurrently</h2>
<p>Instead of refreshing the PHP file yourself every time you update your Twitter status, simply setup a cron job on your web server. I have mine setup to run the PHP script every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Also, to save some server resources and not update the image if Twitter status hasn&#8217;t changed, I also modified the code a bit to save the latest tweet in a text file. If upon PHP file execution Twitter status hasn&#8217;t changed, it won&#8217;t waste resources and generate a new image, but rather simply stops the execution.</p>
<p>My cron job looks like this (the location of PHP may be different on your web server):</p>
<pre>
/usr/bin/php5 -q /home/10416/domains/arthero.com/html/twitter_update.php
</pre>
<p>Download the final file below (and rename to .php):<br />
&raquo; <a href="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/twitter.txt" target="_blank">Twitter status into image</a></p>
<p>Look at the final result:<br />
&raquo; <a href="http://www.arthero.com/-random-/virb/twitter/twitter.png" target="_blank">Final image included in Virb</a><br />
&raquo; <a href="http://www.arthero.com/-random-/virb/twitter/virb.png" target="_blank">Template image used to create it</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The code won&#8217;t work right away unless you specify a custom font and change the function to use default font!</p>

So I quickly came up with a one-page-layout portfolio, but it wasn&#8217;t me. It wasn&#8217;t showcasing my interests and talents in itself. I wanted my portfolio to not only showcase previous work, but to be a showcase item itself. I wanted it to be something simple, yet be able to get the message across and show what I really love to do on the web.</p>
<p>Hope it worked:<br />

<h2>IE6 issues</h2>
<p>For some reason, the whole PNG Alpha Transparency CSS hack for IE6 isn&#8217;t working for me anymore:</p>
<pre>filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='image.png',<span class="linewrap">??</span> sizingMethod=&#8217;scale&#8217;);</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing something small, yet I can&#8217;t track it down. If anyone has any ideas, hints, tips, etc., please let me know!</p>
<p><strong>Technical note:</strong> Today&#8217;s browser war is won by <em>IE7</em> as it renders animations much smoother than any other browser I&#8217;ve tested with. <em>Safari</em> is a clear second, while <em>Firefox</em> (on both PC and Mac) is really sluggish and comes in third. Surprised? So was I. <em>IE6</em> is a clear looser for not having Alpha Transparency support.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.virb.com" target="_blank">Virb</a> is the breathtaking, interactive and totally awesome new social tool. In other words, <em>Virb is everything MySpace should have been</em>. From the user perspective, I very much enjoy how beautiful the site is and how everything goes well together. For a designer, who is usually frustrated with poorly designed tools, this is priceless.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.virb.com/dimitry" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/154/419673436_418aaa0769_m.jpg" title="Virb profile" alt="Virb profile" class="lefty" border="0" height="162" width="240" /></a>Having gotten an invite to the site, I used their basic profile customization to personalize mine a bit and left it at that. Soon after that, I started noticing some unique profiles and quickly discovered the advanced customization features. <em>I was in awe!</em> Even with a few shortcomings, they are pretty powerful and easy to use. Thus, in a few hours of work was born <a href="http://www.virb.com/dimitry" target="_blank">my new Virb profile</a>, which I present to you now. Check it out and let me know what you think! True, I couldn&#8217;t stay away from light-on-dark color scheme and next version of this blog will most likely feature a similar scheme.</p>
<h2>Is Virb too little too late?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.virb.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/virb.gif" class="righty" border="0" height="35" width="70" /></a>I had a small interesting conversation with a friend about Virb in NYC a few days ago. His answer to the question was, in fact, <strong>Yes</strong>, too little too late. While I don&#8217;t at all think Virb is too little as it is packed with features and the team keeps rolling out new ones all the time, it is fairly late to enter the game. Nevertherless, I don&#8217;t mind that at all. The people I can meet on Virb far outweight those on MySpace. The user demographic is simply completely different, which I enjoy a lot, so if Virb stays small, I won&#8217;t mind that one bit!</p>
<h2>New blog theme? Again!?</h2>
<p>Yes, again. I love this simple and content focused layout, but most of the feedback included &#8220;<em>&#8230; but, this is not you.</em>&#8221; I completely agree with that statement, this isn&#8217;t me and it doesn&#8217;t represent what I&#8217;m about at all.</p>
<p>In turn, I will be releasing this theme as a public Wordpress theme (with a few adjustments of course). This way, my work won&#8217;t be in vain and I already know it&#8217;s in demand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the next version will entail, but hopefully it&#8217;ll wow you. I have a bit more time this semester as it is my last (God, I hate senioritis.. in college no less), thus all the random work lately.</p>
<h2>In other news</h2>
<p>My buddy <a href="http://www.pstam.com" target="_blank">Paul</a> got his hands on the &#8216;<em>$100 Computer</em>&#8216; and he wrote up a nice detailed review of it. I love the whole concept and the purpose of this device! <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/03/13/hands-on-the-100-laptop/" target="_blank">Go on and read it</a> ??.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/adobecs3.gif" class="righty" height="204" width="252" />I&#8217;m so ecstatic. Adobe <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/03/05/adobe-to-ship-cs3-march-27th/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the much rumored launch date for the much anticipated Creative Suite 3: <strong>March 27th</strong>. I will be shelling money out for the whole thing the first day I can pick it up at school and installing it as fast as I can run back to my apartment. The whole suite will consist of Intel-native applications, thus most likely resulting in a nice bump of Mac sales, especially Mac Pro. Photoshop CS3 Beta has already proved that Adobe can deliver great layout and more importantly, speed improvements. According to Adobe, this will be:</p>
<blockquote><p>the largest software release in Adobe&#8217;s 25-year history</p></blockquote>
<p>?? <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/procreative/news/index.cfm?newsid=17399" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: We are announcing Creative Suite 3 on March 27th. However, the software <u>will not</u> ship until later in Spring 2007.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h2>In other news</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/nyc.gif" class="lefty" height="222" width="294" />I&#8217;m taking a nice trip with my girlfriend and my brother to New York City, which will undoubtedly prove to be an amazing time. The unexpected trip was for the east coast meet-up for the ever secret TheRoot42 organization (see my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimitryb/sets/72157594209460921/" target="_blank">first meet</a> with the crew). So far, we&#8217;re gonna hit up the awesome <a href="http://marriott.com/hotels/hotel-information/restaurant/nycmq-new-york-marriott-marquis-times-square/" target="_blank">The View</a> revolving restaurant on top of Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. I&#8217;ve been there with my parents back in 2000 I believe and it&#8217;s truly a beautiful view.</p>
<p>Other places we&#8217;re gonna try to visit are the usuals such as <a href="http://www.nycwax.com/" target="_blank">Madame Tussauds</a> Wax Museum, Empire State Building, <a href="http://www.moma.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)</a>, Battery Park, Sony Wonder Technology Lab, Ground Zero site, Sightseeing tour (although I never wanna get off that damn bus&#8230;) and bunch of other things. Feel free to recommend something else!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blog has gotten a complete makeover, so jump out of your RSS reader to see the new content-focused theme. As you can see, no more light-on-dark color scheme, no more JavaScript and hopefully, no more unreadable text.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/newtheme.gif" class="lefty" height="132" width="303" />I found it frustrating reading some of my blog posts. The text was too small, colors were right (especially for you PC users) and so it was time for a fix. As you can see, this is a really drastic change, but I hope it&#8217;s for the better. I kept it fairly simple by taking out categories and other random stuff that frankly no one cares about (other than search bots) and not complicating the colors or the layout. Content is the focus, everything else is really secondary.</p>
<p>It was a fun experience considering I only started this theme yesterday morning. Keeping that in mind, if you find any bugs, please let me know!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.techquilashots.com/" target="_blank">Steve Poland</a> over at  <a href="http://www.techquilashots.com/2007/02/28/advice-you-never-hit-a-bulls-eye-if-you-don%e2%80%99t-throw-the-darts/" target="_blank">Techquila Shots</a> blog brought up an interesting point. He talks about the advantages of sharing your business ideas with the public.</p>
<blockquote><p>Break-down the wall of fear that ???Someone is going to steal my idea if I talk about it!??? ??? IT???S JUST AN IDEA. Go get people???s PRICELESS feedback on your idea, evolve it, and execute. If someone stole your idea during that process, you???re 49 people ahead of them in finding out how to truly evolve it into something that will work. Execution is the key. Don???t execute until you know from 50 people???s perspectives that you???ll be executing properly.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/bizidea.jpg" title="Business Idea" alt="Business Idea" class="righty" height="180" width="240" />I definitely agree that getting major feedback your next big money maker idea is a very good thing and can potentially save you lots of money along the way. At the same time, I think the target listener should be kept in mind. After all, sharing a web startup idea with hundreds of other web entrepreneurs is risky, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out with no experience under your belt.</p>
<p>Your target focus group should be those same people who would use your service or product. Now, if it so happens that you&#8217;re building a service for entrepreneurs, then so be it. Get feedback from potential users! Remember, you&#8217;re solving one of their problems, so asking your geeky programmer friends about your big idea for next generation running shoes will get you nowhere (unless they run of course!)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things have been going good so far. Thank&#8217;s for all the comments in the <a href="http://www.arthero.com/blog/2007/02/15/im-moving-part-1/">Part 1</a>. We appreciate all the support!</p>
<h2>Step 3: Budget yourself</h2>
<p>This step was probably most fun for me. Call me crazy, but anything finance related is fun for me. It&#8217; s my major after all! What started as a couple of simple numbers and calculations in Excel quickly grew into an extensive spreadsheet covering almost every part of our lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/moving3.png" class="righty" border="0" height="69" width="148" /></a>Since my father has humongous Excel spreadsheets for his own finances, he helped me out a lot. Unfortunately, I live at school right now and we barely have enough time to talk about it on weekends. This is where <a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheets</a> came in. I&#8217;ve never used it before, so I was pleasantly surprised to find out about its collaboration features. Mandy and my dad both got invites to edit the document and right away I started notice changes and corrections.</p>
<p>How to build an effective forecasted budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with your projected income.<br />
<em>This was easy for me, a bit harder for Mandy as we had to do some research on average salaries in the area for her profession.</em></li>
<li>Make sure you don&#8217;t forget to take out taxes from the projected income!<br />
<em>This takes out a big chunk of course (~30%), so it&#8217;s important.</em></li>
<li>Jot down every possible expense you may encounter.<br />
<em>Note: Parents know this stuff! So ask them.</em></li>
<li><strong>Add, subtract, multiply and pray.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s all the things we&#8217;ve noted as monthly expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent and utilities<br />
<em>Some apartment complexes include utilities in the rent, others don&#8217;t.</em></li>
<li>Health and dental insurance<br />
<em>Yahoo! has great benefits.</em></li>
<li>Automotive<br />
<em>Loan payments on car, insurance, parking (a lot in San Francisco) and gas.</em></li>
<li>Food<br />
<em>This includes going out to eat too.</em></li>
<li>Entertainment<br />
<em>Travel, bars, clubs, movies, etc.</em></li>
<li>Clothing<br />
<em>Some things here and there&#8230; Yeah right!</em></li>
<li>Home care<br />
<em>Self explanatory</em></li>
<li>Other medical expenses<br />
<em>Tylenol, &#8230;</em></li>
<li>School loans<br />
<em>Can&#8217;t wait for this!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Are we missing anything? Loan payment calculations are fairly easy in Excel (not to mention all dealers have special calculators online). I personally use the PMT function in Excel. It&#8217;s easy, just write down your principal (car amount minus down-payment), loan rate (the lower the better obviously), loan term (usually 5 years) and you&#8217;re all set! Make sure you convert the rate and term to months (divide the rate by 12 and multiply term by 12). Write <em><strong>=pmt</strong> </em>in Excel and it will guide you through the rest.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Apartment hunt</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimitryb/152372415/in/set-72157594143774309" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/moving5.png" class="righty" border="0" height="185" width="248" /></a>San Francisco apartment search is interesting. In my searches, I stumbled onto this site and it summarizes everything fairly well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apartment hunting in San Francisco is unique. Unlike New York, we don&#8217;t have brokers who control the listings and charge renters a massive fee to lease. And unlike the South Bay (and the rest of America), we only have a few large apartment communities run by billion dollar public companies. Many, if not the majority of rental units in San Francisco are privately owned and barely advertised. Because the market is tight, most landlords can find a tenant within a few days simply by putting a sign in front of their building. For apartment hunters, it&#8217;s a maddening situation&#8211; it can feel like the only way to find a place is to quit your job and stalk every neighborhood looking for &#8220;for rent&#8221; signs. This is not a life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Great! I&#8217;ve got my work cut out for me. Fortunately, I&#8217;ve found some good sites. Since Craigslist is the main point of search, <a href="http://www.housingmaps.com" target="_blank">HousingMaps.com</a> comes in very handy. This is a basic mashup site connecting Craigslist listings with Google Maps. We&#8217;ve pinpointed which areas we want to live in, so this helps a lot in terms of filtering. Saves lots of time!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-San-Francisco.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/moving4.png" class="righty" border="0" height="48" width="262" /></a>I&#8217;ve also kept my eye out for apartment complexes. Although there are not many as mentioned above, some are still attractive. This is where <a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-San-Francisco.html" target="_blank">ApartmentRatings.com</a> comes in. This site aggregates a number of ratings for the apartments based on real user input. Every time I find something of interest, I always search for it on this site to get a feel of the management, noise levels, etc. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp.com</a> is also useful. Although more broad, it does have some apartment reviews.</p>
<p>Staying within the budget is important. San Francisco is beautiful and it has a lot of good and tempting apartment offerings. Unfortunately, at this stage of our lives, we can&#8217;t afford to live lavishly, so every time I look for apartments, I try to stay within the budget. Getting a more expensive apartment means cutting some other expenses, which may in turn only worsen our quality of life.</p>
<p>Whew, that&#8217;s it for now! The rest will probably come in the coming months as we get closer to the date.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true. My girlfriend Mandy and I will be moving to San Francisco this upcoming summer. School will be finished by the time May rolls around and it&#8217;s time to grow up. It&#8217;s time to be an adult, so hopefully we&#8217;re both ready.</p>
<p>This decision was a tough one. San Francisco is over 2,200 miles away from home and the distance will be hard to overcome for a while, but I spent whole summer in California, so it&#8217;s doable. Having Mandy&#8217;s support and presence will make it so much easier. I decided to document our moving process both to get tips and to also help anyone else who may be in the same situation in the future.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Get a job!</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/moving1.png" class="righty" height="68" width="245" />Don&#8217;t move in the blind. Job security certainly helps to forecast the future, to create a workable budget, to see if we can actually afford to move, etc. I was able to come out with a full-time offer after my internship with Yahoo! last summer, so I&#8217;ve taken the plunge and accepted my first full-time job offer. Whoa, I&#8217;m an adult? Time flies.</p>
<p>While everything seems to be peachy for me, Mandy has taken steps to become an officially certified veterinary technician. She took the boards exam few weeks ago, so cross your fingers! The certificate will definitely help her get a job in San Francisco and she has been researching vet hospitals in the area, updating her resume and will soon start forwarding it to those places.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Find a good location</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/moving2.png" class="righty" height="253" width="264" />This hasn&#8217;t been an easy step since Yahoo! is located 40 miles south from San Francisco. So why did we chose to live so far away? Having spent the summer in the South Bay, I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with the social life. I&#8217;m from a suburb of Pittsburgh and to me, that&#8217;s exactly what South Bay looks like: a big suburb with 1,500 tech firms and lots of neighborhoods and apartment complexes. Every little town (Sunnyvale, Mountain View, etc.) has a small 1-2 street downtown with a few pubs, restaurants and basically no night life. We&#8217;re not big partiers (sp?), but we&#8217;re also fairly young and at 21 years old, I just want more excitement in my life!</p>
<p>Every time we&#8217;ve visited San Francisco we loved it. The city is great and beautiful with all its hills and neighborhoods. From Castro to Noe Valley to SoMa, there&#8217;s SO much to see. I&#8217;m looking forward to it! As we&#8217;re quickly realising, with that comes a big price: San Francisco living isn&#8217;t cheap. In fact, it&#8217;s second more expensive city in the United States (right after NYC). Yuck! This brings me to my next point, <strong>budgeting</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll cover that and more in the upcoming parts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.reinvigorate.net" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/reinv.gif" class="righty" border="0" /></a>Let&#8217;s begin with this: <strong><a href="http://www.reinvigorate.net" target="_blank">Reinvigorate</a> is great!</strong></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s backtrack a little bit. <a href="http://www.reinvigorate.net" target="_blank">Reinvigorate</a> used to be a very useful website tracking tool. Most importantly, it was free. At this point I&#8217;m gonna start making things up. Blatantly. Then it went down and many wept for there wasn&#8217;t a great tool to see live statistics anymore! I really don&#8217;t know what happened, but I think the demand grew, fast, and they couldn&#8217;t keep up (?), so it went down hard.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/reinv1.gif" class="righty" height="125" width="162" /> But rejoice! It is back! And apparently it&#8217;s better than ever! Ok, enough with the exclamation points! (whoops.) The new tool has a plethora of useful statistics and has very easy implementation. Just pop some JavaScript in your website and you&#8217;re ready to go. The ease of tracking multiple sites is great and there&#8217;s no limit on the number of sites you want to monitor.</p>
<p>This couldn&#8217;t have been released at a better time too. I&#8217;ve switched hosts recently to <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net" target="_blank">(mt)</a> and it doesn&#8217;t have Awstats implemented, a tool I used to use at my old host. In fact, all (mt) offers is Urchin stats, which is so confusing! If you&#8217;ve ever used Google Analytics then you know what I&#8217;m talking about. I briefly considered Mint, but I couldn&#8217;t justify spending money (even at a that nice price point of $30) on reading some stats. Sorry Mr. Inman, maybe in the future.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.arthero.com/blog/wp-pics/reinv2.gif" class="righty" height="68" width="484" />This beautiful tool that is Reinvigorate is currently in beta testing, so I guess I kind of.. lied above when I said it&#8217;s out. Still, I signed up not even a week ago for a beta invite and have already got it, so give it a try. <a href="http://www.reinvigorate.net" target="_blank">Good luck!</a></p>
