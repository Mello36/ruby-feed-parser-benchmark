			<title><![CDATA[ Scott Ruffalo Case Gets Seedier, Sadder ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/Picture_4.png" width="340" height="190" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>More developments in the <a href="http://gawker.com/5107695/stiller-steps-in-for-ruffalo-after-russian-roulette-tragedy">strange death</a> of actor <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged MARK RUFFALO" title="Click here to read more posts tagged MARK RUFFALO" href="http://gawker.com/tag/mark-ruffalo/">Mark Ruffalo</a>'s brother Scott. Supposedly police aren't buying the whole "Russian Roulette" story given to them by the "Saudi princess," <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SHAHA MISHAAL ADHAM" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SHAHA MISHAAL ADHAM" href="http://gawker.com/tag/Shaha-Mishaal-Adham/">Shaha Mishaal Adham</a>. Can't trust foreigners! </p> <p>Adham, who apparently <a href="http://hollyscoop.com/mark-ruffalo/shaha-mishaal-adham-was-always-a-problem-child_18691.aspx">raised hell back at her tony LA prep school, Harvard Westlake</a> was caught by buzzing TMZ cameras and, sadly, was happy to talk to them. She's glad, and quick, to call her old friend Scott "crazy." So that's nice. I was also kinda hoping, when I first heard about her, for someone more mysterious and worldly. Instead she sounds like that one girl from <em>My Super Sweet 16</em> who said "moooommmmm" in this really annoying way and got carried into her party by a group of hunky mens. So that's stupid. </p> <p>Also stupid is the tale she spun about Scott dying from a Russian roulette accident. Rumor is that <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2008/12/12/cops-arent-buying-ruffalo-death-story/">the cops are starting to not so much believe that story</a>, because of little details like the gunshot being to the back of his head. </p> <p>So the mystery thickens and begins to ooze into smeary Hollywood scandal territory, with a blasé party girl in the center, talking willingly to TMZ. I'd say that the brother of a classy, artsy actor like <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged MARK RUFFALO" title="Click here to read more posts tagged MARK RUFFALO" href="http://gawker.com/tag/mark-ruffalo/">Mark Ruffalo</a> doesn't deserve this (and he doesn't), but really, ain't nobody who deserves this.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Pinup Queen Bettie Page, 85, Dies ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/Bettie_Page__color1.jpg" alt="Bettie Page, color1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BETTIE PAGE" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BETTIE PAGE" href="http://gawker.com/tag/bettie-page/">Bettie Page</a>, whose saucy photo spreads helped get men through, and then end, the sexual repression of the 1950s, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/arts/12page.html?_r=1&amp;hp">died of a heart attack</a> in Los Angeles. She was 85.</p> <p>A straight-A high school student and graduate of Vanderbilt University, Page worked stints as a teacher, secretary, fur coat model and stage and television actress before a police officer and pinup photographer discovered her on the beach at Coney Island in 1950. She soon moved on to racy S&amp;M-themed photos with a brother-sister team team who "<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081212/ap_en_ot/obit_bettie_page;_ylt=AichSjWwdcgvVFhnYlxUdNes0NUE">cut her hair into the dark bangs that became her signature</a>." The photos became the subject of a congressional investigation and, page said, led to harassment by federal agents.</p> <p>Page posed in a Christmas-themed <em>Playboy</em> centerfold in 1955 (<a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a231/HEATHERTATTOOS/Bettie_Page_01.jpg">image NSFW</a>). Heffner <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081212/ap_en_ot/obit_bettie_page;_ylt=AichSjWwdcgvVFhnYlxUdNes0NUE">told</a> AP Page "had a tremendous impact on our society... an iconic figure in <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged POP CULTURE" title="Click here to read more posts tagged POP CULTURE" href="http://gawker.com/tag/pop-culture/">pop culture</a> who influenced sexuality, taste in fashion."</p> <p>Soon after, she became depressed, and two marriages in quick succession ended in divorce. Page was diagnosed with schizophrenia and sent to a mental hospital. She later had a religious conversion. After living for years on Social Security benefits, Page benefited from an image revival the Times described thusly:</p> <blockquote> <p> David Stevens, creator of the comic-book and later movie character the Rocketeer, immortalized her as the Rocketeer’s girlfriend. Fashion designers revived her look. Uma Thurman, in bangs, reincarnated Bettie in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” and Demi Moore, Madonna and others appeared in Page-like photos.</p> <p> There were <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BETTIE PAGE" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BETTIE PAGE" href="http://gawker.com/tag/bettie-page/">Bettie Page</a> playing cards, lunch boxes, action figures, T-shirts and beach towels. Her saucy images went up in nightclubs. Bettie Page fan clubs sprang up. Look-alike contests, featuring leather-and-lace and kitten-with-a-whip Betties, were organized</p> </blockquote> <p>Page also came to be worshipped on the internet. Fan sites widely circulated old pictures, typified by those below, which mix racy S&amp;M shots with tamer beach-and-bikini material. These pictures give a sampling of the sort of pictures that were, according to AP, " quickly tacked up on walls in military barracks, garages and elsewhere, where they remained for years."</p> <p>Later in life, Page refused to be photographed, saying she wanted to be remembered as she had looked in her heyday.</p> <p>The next time you see a naked picture on the internet, or some good bondage porn, think of Bettie Page. She specifically requested it! In addition to making it all possible. (So hot!)</p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/bettie_page_spank01-1.jpg" alt="bettie_page_spank01-1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /> <img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/bettie.jpg" alt="bettie.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /></p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/Bettie_Page_1.jpg" alt="Bettie_Page_1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/BettiePage11.jpg" alt="BettiePage11.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /></p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/bplb.jpg" alt="bplb.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/BettieontheBeach.jpg" alt="BettieontheBeach.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Colin Powell Slams Rush Limbaugh ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/83345939.jpg" alt="83345939.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" />As usual, <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged COLIN POWELL" title="Click here to read more posts tagged COLIN POWELL" href="http://gawker.com/tag/colin-powell/">Colin Powell</a> is the first to say what other prominent Republicans are only thinking: The <a href="http://gawker.com/5065615/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama">eloquent endorser</a> of Barack Obama now warns that conservative media linchpin <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged RUSH LIMBAUGH" title="Click here to read more posts tagged RUSH LIMBAUGH" href="http://gawker.com/tag/rush-limbaugh/">Rush Limbaugh</a> <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/12/11/powell-gop-polarization-backfired-in-election/">is destroying the movement</a>.</p> <p>In a CNN interview to air Sunday, Powell first said the GOP should reach out to minorities (WTF??) without using "dogma" (<a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged GONE ROGUE" title="Click here to read more posts tagged GONE ROGUE" href="http://gawker.com/tag/gone-rogue/">GONE ROGUE</a>!). Then he told Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity (implicitly) and <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged RUSH LIMBAUGH" title="Click here to read more posts tagged RUSH LIMBAUGH" href="http://gawker.com/tag/rush-limbaugh/">Rush Limbaugh</a> (directly!) to just please stop talking:</p> <blockquote> <p> I think the party has to stop shouting at the world and at the country. I think that the party has to take a hard look at itself, and I've talked to a number of leaders in recent weeks and they understand that."<br /> "Can we continue to listen to Rush Limbaugh? Is this really the kind of party that we want to be when these kinds of spokespersons seem to appeal to our lesser instincts rather than our better instincts?"</p> </blockquote> <p>Honestly, the future of the Republican party is easily one of the most interesting topics in politics right now, and not just because (from the sound of things) <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged COLIN POWELL" title="Click here to read more posts tagged COLIN POWELL" href="http://gawker.com/tag/colin-powell/">Colin Powell</a> is positioning himself as one of its key future leaders. The conservative movement is near the end of an epic crack-up, its fiscal conservatives alienated from Wall Street business Republicans over the bail out; social conservatives still bitter over the victory of Barack Obama and trying to hold down growing dissent within their own party over issues like gay marriage and immigration (even the hated outgoing evangelical president is against them on the latter).</p> <p>Destruction like this is followed by a reformation. While the victorious Democratic Party has its key leaders more firmly in place by the day, the Republicans are searching for new blood and, through that, a new message. Party reformulations like that come maybe once every 15 years; conservatives haven't faced this sort of change since the movement solidified its core principles in the 1950s.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> Considering Going Online-Only? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/EWcover.jpeg" width="304" height="326" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2">We've heard from multiple sources that the idea of going online-only is being seriously considered by the leadership of <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY" href="http://gawker.com/tag/entertainment-weekly/">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>. And it wouldn't be a bad idea.</p> <p>EW's average circulation has been steady for a few years:</p> <p><a href="http://www.magazine.org/CONSUMER_MARKETING/CIRC_TRENDS/26643.aspx">2007</a>: 1.8 million</p> <p><a href="http://www.magazine.org/CONSUMER_MARKETING/CIRC_TRENDS/22175.aspx">2006</a>: 1.8 million</p> <p><a href="http://www.magazine.org/CONSUMER_MARKETING/CIRC_TRENDS/16117.aspx">2005</a>: 1.8 million</p> <p>But in the first half of '08, it was down by 7%, according to <em>Folio</em>. More importantly, their <a href="http://www.foliomag.com/2008/when-layoffs-are-actually-good-news">ad pages dropped by nearly a fifth</a> through September of this year. They had layoffs earlier this year, which some actually considered good news, because lots of people held up EW as a candidate to fold.</p> <p>But their web traffic has been doing great!</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/EWtraffic.jpeg" width="606" height="284" style="display:block;" /><br> <br clear="all"></p> <p>The <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> has <a href="http://gawker.com/5069969/christian-science-monitor-gives-up-on-print">already announced its plans</a> to become the first major paper to go online-only. So EW's move would not be an off-the-wall thing. Print ads bring in most of the revenue, but when ad page sales crater, the production of the print magazine stays wildly expensive&mdash;far more expensive than gaining readers online.</p> <p>You know who would applaud this move, too? Jeff Jarvis, the cranky media guy who founded EW and is now one of the loudest preachers of the "<a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged PRINT IS DEAD" href="http://gawker.com/tag/print-is-dead/">Print is dead</a>" gospel.</p> <p>If they did go online-only, and it worked, EW would be a trailblazer. And they might prevent themselves from folding, in the process. If you know more about this, <a href="mailto:tips@gawker.com">email us</a>.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We got an email from EW's PR person denying the rumors:</p> <blockquote> <p>I just wanted to let you know that there is absolutely no truth to the rumor that <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY" title="Click here to read more posts tagged ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY" href="http://gawker.com/tag/entertainment-weekly/">Entertainment Weekly</a> is going digital only. In fact, our circulation is stable, our audience numbers are up and we're full steam ahead for 2009.</p> </blockquote> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ The Official 'Find Padma a Mate' Campaign 2008/9 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/Padma_Melt.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/Padma_Melt.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" /><i>Good morning and welcome. My name is <a href="htt'p://www.joshuadavidstein.com">Joshua David Stein</a>. I'd like to get at you for a mo' about <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Top_Chef/season/5/index.php">Top Chef</a>, the Gossip Girl of culinary cinema verité programming.</i></p> <p>Last week bizarro Jackie O doppleganger Aryan won the challenge. I didn't see that episode and my imagination is too impoverished to construct a credible explanation of it so I entered her win into the ledger as "Strange Occurrence Not To Be Repeated." Too soon, monsoon! It happened again but last night's episode was baffling for more than just that reason.</p> <p>First let's get the facts out of the way in the "Handy 39 Word Narrative Recapitulation": Quickfire, blind taste test. Hosea won. Challenge, cook for Gail's bridal shower. Conceit, teams, in groups of three, create dish based on following tradition; "On wedding day, wear something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue." Aryan won. Anglo conspiracy.</p> <p>The episode was rife with errors. The Old team&mdash;two bald guys and a Ken doll&mdash; included Carpaccio, describing it as an old and classic dish. Carpaccio was born in Harry's Bar in Venice in 1950, when Giuseppe Cipriani (grandfather and namesake of currently exiled Giuseppe Cipriani). That's not old at all. I've slept with women who were born before then. I kid! I kid! I think! Secondly, Blue team's dashing Italian says at one point, the yellow and the green components of the plate mix on the light spectrum to make blue. Nope, blue and yellow combine to make green; Those properties aren't transitive. Lastly and most personally affecting, Stefan clearly has a mistaken understanding of the word lesbian. I think he just repeats it phonetically when the need arises. He tries to kiss&mdash;but not with tongue, that's icky&mdash;Jaime, the short lezbeeyahn with a big ego, lots of tattoos who deserved to win. But that won't work because she likes shes not hes and hes a he.</p> <p>But here's what's really wrong: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbqv3MwwVd8">Mawwaige!</a> <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged PADMA LAKSHMI" href="http://gawker.com/tag/padma-lakshmi/">Padma Lakshmi</a> is still single. Not to neg Simmons (<strike>Congratulations!</strike> Best wishes!) but what has rotted in this topsy-turvey world that a foxy curvy girl like Lakshmi still roams the linoleum hallways of love lonesome? People, there's only one set of footprints! Maybe the Lord is carrying her. But maybe there's no God at all and she's alone. This can not abide. You know when you have a crush on a girl but then you have a girlfriend or a wife or something at any rate that precludes you from pursuing the crush so instead you try to pawn off this or that girl to one of your friends because look, if you can't do it, at least you can hear about <i>someone</i> doing it and get vicarious satisfaction? Yeah, we know she was once married to a bat-faced author with a fatwa hanging over him. But not anymore.</p> <p>So let's get it together people. Let's <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged FIND PADMA A MATE" href="http://gawker.com/tag/find-padma-a-mate/">find Padma a mate</a>. Like so many things having to do with love/sex, this has the possibility to go viral. If we try, <i>si se puede!</i> It can't be hard. "SIF, 38, looks like Pocahantas but actually the other Indian. Ex-Model/Cookbook author. Likes weed, alcohol, partying, NPR. ISO SM, 18-92, must like pets. Non smoking a plus. Fatwa OK." We've even gone and prepared a video personal ad (see above, thanks to Gawker video guy Mike Byhoff). Forward it to your friends, ex-lovers, food lovers, big spenders, Wim Wenders, Ry Cooder, Lewis Libby aka Scooter, any one and every one who might help. If my calculations are correct, Padma should be married by January. Send your nominations to joshuadavidstein@gmail.com. If this works out, we'll all be invited to the wedding.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ The Golden Globe Awards: Killers Of Dreams ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/golden-globe.jpg" width="300" height="382" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>Oh happy day, awards season has really started! The Golden Globe awards nominations have been announced, sending some hopes soaring and others to dash themselves on the rocks and die a quick death. </p> <p><em>Australia</em>, <em>W.</em>, and Josh Brolin were all met this morning with unfortunate news, their big dreams for the Oscar prom are now, if not completely gone, badly hobbled. After the jump we'll take a look, major category by major category, at what damage this 83-member little foreigners club has done to dear, sweet Hollywood.</p> <p><strong>Best Feature, Drama</strong><br /> Gus Van Sant's gay biopic <em>Milk</em> was a surprising non-inclusion here. Everything else that was nominated was well-reviewed (except for <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged THE READER" title="Click here to read more posts tagged THE READER" href="http://gawker.com/tag/the-reader/">The Reader</a></em>, which <a href="http://gawker.com/5106789/harvey-weinsteins-last-best-oscar-hope-may-be-crashing-and-burning">needed to get nominated</a> to keep <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HARVEY WEINSTEIN" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HARVEY WEINSTEIN" href="http://gawker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein/">Harvey Weinstein</a> alive), but <em>Milk</em> has probably been the most widely praised movie of the season. I guess foreign people are homophobes. </p> <p><strong>Best Feature, Comedy</strong><br /> More good news for <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HARVEY WEINSTEIN" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HARVEY WEINSTEIN" href="http://gawker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein/">Harvey Weinstein</a>! <em>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</em> was nominated for this category and three others, keeping the sun-splashed Spanish Woody Allen romance alive even though it debuted all the way last summer.</p> <p><strong>Best Actors, Drama</strong><br /> No surprises for the actors, really. On the actresses' side, though, it is a bit disappointing to not see indie hero Melissa Leo nominated for her gritty, sad work in <em>Frozen River.</em> Oscar, hopefully, will be kinder.</p> <p><strong>Best Actors, Comedy</strong><br /> Hah, <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged JAMES FRANCO" title="Click here to read more posts tagged JAMES FRANCO" href="http://gawker.com/tag/james-franco/">James Franco</a> got a bizarro nod for <em>Pineapple Express</em> and Dustin Hoffman got a "well isn't he <em>nice</em>" nomination for some movie about old people, co-starring Emma Thompson (who's also up for a trophy.) Come January, we'll probably have to put Sally Hawkins up in the big leagues for her <em>Happy-Go-Lucky</em> performance, probably knocking out the "I want MY son" antics of Angelina Jolie.</p> <p><strong>Supporting Actors</strong><br /> Robert Downey Jr. AND Tom Cruise for <em>Tropic Thunder</em>! That is very funny. And fun. Good for the gay old HFP. Ralph Fiennes was the lone, sad nomination for the once-aspiring <em>The Duchess</em>, joining his fellow in "you're not gonna win, but hey!"ness, the dearly departed Heath Ledger. There's Kate Winslet for <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged THE READER" title="Click here to read more posts tagged THE READER" href="http://gawker.com/tag/the-reader/">The Reader</a></em> in the supporting category, which might bode for a smaller Oscar campaign. And good for the always-awesome Viola Davis and dear Marisa Tomei. Davis will probably win the Oscar this year, but let's hope Tomei gets nominated too. </p> <p><strong>Screenplay</strong><br /> No Charlie Kaufman! Ah well. People just did not sync up with <em>Synecdoche</em>, I guess. And our youngest gay Dustin Lance Black was conspicuously not rewarded for his labor of love project, <em>Milk</em>. We're betting that Peter Morgan will win for his wordy <em>Frost/Nixon.</em></p> <p>So that's that! Some sadness abounds for Baz Luhrmann and his troupe of singing aborigines, while Harvey Weinstein clings to life, buoyed suddenly by glitzy recognition from a really small group of non-Americans. We'll have to wait until January to see where the Oscar chips fall, but these silly awards are usually something of a decent barometer. Other than that, though, they're useless. So congrats, all.</p> <p>See the full list of nominations, including TV!, <a href="http://defamer.com/5107309/golden-globes-jilt-milk-dark-knight-in-treatment-leads-tv-noms">here.</a> And now that we know which films are nominated, vote in our <a href="http://gawker.com/5107358/gawkers-golden-globe-poll">Golden Globe Poll</a>.</p> ]]></description>

Here are some of the questions <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1208/Blagojevich_questions_censored_on_Transition_site.html">Ben Smith discovered</a> voted down to hell by Obama's angry Islamist mob:</p> <p><ul> <li>"Given the current corruption charges involving Blagojevich, will 'serious' campaign finance reform that takes money completely out of politics through publicly funded elections be a priority in the first term?" asked Metteyya of Santa Cruz, California.</li></p> <p> <li>"In light of the recent corruption scandals (Blagojevich, Rangel, Jefferson, Stevens, etc) that have dominated the political scene,is there any ethics legislation being crafted to actually curb corruption and prevent another wave of nixonian cynicism?", a question from "lupercal," of Gainesville.'</li></p> <p> <li>And: "Is <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> aware of any communications in the last six weeks between Rod Blagojevich or anyone representing Rod Blagojevich and any of Obama's top aides?", a question from Phil from Pennsylvania.</li> </ul></p> <p>Change.gov looked like it was going to be <a href="http://wonkette.com/404742/a-childrens-treasury-of-polite-intelligent-threaded-comments-on-changegov">a nice, civil exception</a> to the usual mob rule in Web comment sections. And maybe it would have been, with some conscientious Change.govers letting in some Blago questions. But now Drudge <a href="http://www.drudgesiren.com/allhl.php?id=65486#h65486">has linked the site</a>, via this story, so a bunched of pissed off Obama conspiracists will jump into the game, resulting in an epic mod war and soon the whole thing will look like a <a href="http://gawker.com/339382/a-hymn-for-the-asshole-youtube-commenter">YouTube screaming match</a>.</p> <p>(Change.gov is the new IRC.)</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Et Tu, NPR? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/npr.jpeg" width="300" height="268" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>Five years ago, National Public Radio got a donation of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1494600">more than $200 million </a>from McDonald's fortune widow Joan Kroc. So you'd think they'd be set for a while, money-wise. But the economy sucks and it's a safe bet that individual donations to public radio are plummeting. We heard <a href="http://gawker.com/5106493/layoffs-at-npr">rumors of layoffs</a> this morning, and now it appears that they're true [UPDATE: it's official], and at least two shows are dying:</p> <p>Tipsters have told us that <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/press/021016.nprwest.html">NPR West</a>, the huge production center in LA, may be "completely shuttering." That's not confirmed, but at least two shows are being shut down. <a href="http://www.current.org/2008/12/npr-said-to-be-shutting-down-two-shows.html">Current.org reports</a> that <em>Day to Day </em>and <em>News and Notes </em>are being canceled, with dozens of layoffs:</p> <blockquote><p>An NPR West staffer says word inside the building is that more than 60 people will lose their jobs. It is unclear whether the production center, established in late 2002 in a major expansion of NPR’s news operations, will remain open.</p></blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2008/12/day_to_day_gets_the_word.php"><br /> LAObserved says</a> <em>Day to Day</em> will probably last a few more months, to allow stations time to rearrange their schedules. </p> <p>$200 million gifts are now not sufficient to save your dream job. Any staffers who want to share their stories, <a href="mailto:tips@gawker.com">email us.</a><br /> <strong><br /> UPDATE: </strong>NPR just sent out a press release saying it is indeed canceling those two shows (they'll end in March) and cutting its total workforce by 7%, thanks to a projected deficit next year of $23 million:</p> <blockquote><p> Staff and expense reductions will be made in reporting, editorial and production areas; station services; digital media; research; communications and administrative support. A total of 64 filled positions have been eliminated against NPR’s current staff of 889, 21 open positions will not be filled and travel and discretionary expenses have been cut across the organization.</p></blockquote> ]]></description>

Jackson says he was told he's "not a target of this investigation," and says he'll cooperate with the investigation. This makes two Obama allies caught seeming a <i>bit</i> corrupt in the Blagojevich filing!</p> <p>As Blago says in the affidavit: "We were approached 'pay to play.' That, you know, he'd raise me 500 grand. An emissary came. Then the other guy would raise a million, if I made him (Senate Candidate 5) a Senator." He's describing a talk with someone reputed to be associated in some fashion with Jackson. It's not quite damning, but it does look like Jackson was more willing to play ball than Obama's team. What's still unclear is why Obama wouldn't want his ally (and supposed friend!) Jackson appointed to his seat, something Blago seems convinced of in taped conversations.</p> <p>Oh, the other Obama ally kinda sorta implicated? <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1208/Source_SEIU_official_was_Stern.html?showall">Andy Stern, the head of the Service Employees International Union.</a> He's "SEUI Official," which seems simple enough.</p> <blockquote><p>On November 12, 2008, ROD BLAGOJEVICH spoke with SEIU Official, who was in Washington, D.C. Prior intercepted phone conversations indicate that approximately a week before this call, ROD BLAGOJEVICH met with SEIU Official to discuss the vacant Senate seat, and ROD BLAGOJEVICH understood that SEIU Official was an emissary to discuss Senate Candidate 1’s interest in the Senate seat. During the conversation with SEIU Official on November 12, 2008, ROD BLAGOJEVICH informed SEIU Official that he had heard the President-elect wanted persons other than Senate Candidate 1 to be considered for the Senate seat. SEIU Official stated that he would find out if Senate Candidate 1 wanted SEIU Official to keep pushing her for Senator with ROD BLAGOJEVICH. ROD BLAGOJEVICH said that “one thing I’d be interested in” is a 501(c)(4) organization. ROD BLAGOJEVICH explained the 501(c)(4) idea to SEIU Official and said that the 501(c)(4)70 could help “our new Senator [Senate Candidate 1].” SEIU Official agreed to “put that flag up and see where it goes.”</p></blockquote> <p>This sounds mostly like Stern is just <i>humoring</i> Blago, and, obviously, the flag didn't go anywhere, as Candidate 1&mdash;Valerie Jarrett&mdash;withdrew from consideration.</p> <p>Still, everyone in Chicago and a few in DC are getting lawyered up. Whee!</p> ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/moose.jpg" alt="moose.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" />Though <a href="http://www.observer.com/2008/media/analysts-times-great-job-guys?page=0%2C0">apologist analyst</a> were apparently out in force, and though the firm <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2008/12/09/nyt-co-execs-under-fire-at-ubs-conference?tid=true">bragged</a> about selling $1 million in Barack Obama knicknacks (whee!), there was no hiding the <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged NEW YORK TIMES" title="Click here to read more posts tagged NEW YORK TIMES" href="http://gawker.com/tag/new-york-times/">New York Times</a> Company's financial distress at a bank's media conference in New York Tuesday. The most alarming report in the wake of the event: Word that the <em>Times</em> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122887202494593459.html?mod=rss_media_and_marketing">will try to renegotiate</a> at least some of its more than $1 billion in debt and is preparing to do without much of a $400 million credit line expiring in May.</p> <p>The company also said it was <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/034bad64-c604-11dd-a741-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1">thinking about selling assets</a>, but it's been making similar noises <a href="http://gawker.com/5003728/times-talks-about-selling-assets-but-who-knows-how-seriously">since at least March</a> and was still talking about the idea, internally at least, <a href="http://gawker.com/5070441/new-york-times-layoffs-still-being-discussed-in-business-suite">in late October</a>. As with the <em>Times</em>' <a href="http://gawker.com/5103901/times-to-mortgage-its-house">bid to mortgage</a> its pricey headquarters, finding a buyer for, say, the <em>Boston Globe</em> or <em>International Herald-Tribune</em> would be tricky in the present economy. About.com, <a href="http://gawker.com/5074501/times-said-shopping-aboutcom">perennially rumored</a> to be for sale, might be an easier sell, to a hungry tech company like Microsoft, but many natural buyers like Google and Yahoo are retrenching.</p> <p>Some shareholders &mdash; or just worried admirers of the newspaper &mdash; are not satisfied. The company has been adding debt (at junk prices, these days) even as it pays out dividends to Sulzberger family members and other shareholders. <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2008/12/09/nyt-co-execs-under-fire-at-ubs-conference?tid=true">Via Jeff Bercovici at <em>Portfolio</em></a>:</p> <blockquote> <p> One audience member wanted to know why the company, which slashed its dividend by nearly 75 percent a few weeks ago, didn't go further. "Why keep the dividend at all?" he demanded. "The notion that cash is flowing out of the company to equity &mdash; it seems like you might not understand the gravity of the situation."</p> </blockquote> <p>Oh, but they're <a href="http://gawker.com/5027314/pinch-sulzbergers-moose-killed-the-times">learning</a>! This whole depression has been very educational for the <a href="http://gawker.com/5093958/what-will-times-scion-do-in-gotham">entire</a> Sulzberger <a href="http://nymag.com/news/media/51015/">family</a>!</p> ]]></description>

Sadly, the archive is missing key issues, containing such classics as "<a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/">Radical Chic: That Party At Lenny's</a>" and "<a href="http://nymag.com/nightlife/features/45933/">Tribal Rights of the New Saturday Night.</a>" But both of those are available, albeit ripped from their original context, on nymag.com, and Google has one classic that isn't: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iNkCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=viva+warhol&amp;ei=-RQ_SbSALYroyATRv7HADg#PPA36,M1">Barbara Goldsmith's "La Dolce Viva,"</a> which revealed the seedy side of Andy Warhol's entourage through Viva, a shriveled one-name actress. "I had never seen anything like it," <a href="http://nymag.com/news/media/48341/index5.html">Tom Wolfe wrote</a> of accompanying nude photos from Diane Arbus. But the article's appearance in the fourth <span style="text-decoration: line-through">debut</span> standalone <em>New York</em> nearly ended Clay Felker's magazine.</p> <p>As Wolfe <a href="http://nymag.com/news/media/48341/index6.html">later remembered</a>,</p> <blockquote> <p> <em>New York</em> lost every high-end retailer on Madison Avenue and beyond. This precipitated a crisis. The board, made up of the big investors, summoned Clay to a meeting... They were hopping mad over this “Viva” business. They could see their investment sinking without a bubble after only four issues. They were ready to can Clay then and there and probably would have, had not the elder statesman and maximum art collector, [Armand ] Erpf, exercised moral suasion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later <em>New York</em> owners <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5D8123CF93AA1575AC0A960958260">could not be talked down from this sort of intervention</a>. The present one at least gets credit for voluntarily sharing (as indicated by a sidebar credit) its library trove with the rest of the world.

			<title><![CDATA[ Why This Is Very Bad News for Barack Obama ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/11/bbbbb.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" />US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald made a point of saying <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> was unaware of the wrongdoings of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, but that decidedly does not mean that our president-elect will emerge from this unscathed. No, this is the kind of distracting, dragged-out mess than can derail a first term&mdash;or at the very least a first 100 days. And, you know, the full extent of the involvement of Obama's team and maybe Obama himself is yet to be discovered. So let's take a look at just a couple of the ways this can go terribly wrong for our president-elect!</p> <p><b>Democratic Culture of Corruption.</b> Remember when the Democrats took back the congress in 2006? They were aided by a million high-profile scandals involving weird sex crimes and plain vanilla corruption by Republicans. Well, the 2010 midterms are right around the corner (SIGH), and guess what House Gop head John Boehner is pushing? <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/12/are_republicans_coming_back.html">The Democratic Culture of Corruption!</a> Before they had to hang their corruption line on defeated corrupt Democratic congressman William Jefferson and the obscure misdeeds of New York member Charlie Rangel. Now they've got the governor of the state the president-elect resides from! Obama could face a less favorable congress in 2011, if this story stays on the front pages.</p> <p><b>Tony Rezko!</b> Hey, guess who's tied up in all this mess? Convicted felon Tony Rezko, who once sold Obama some land, and donated money to Obama's pre-presidential campaigns. So Rezko donated to Blagojevich in exchange for jobs for his friends and associates. Blagojevich's wife was Rezko's real-estate agent too, of course. And Rezko is now shorthand for "corrupt dealings in Chicago involving Barack Obama," even though the Obama-Rezko connection remains the smallest of potatoes compared to what went on with everyone else in Chicago politics.</p> <p><b>Fitzgerald Gets Subpoena-Happy</b> US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald is a really aggressive investigator, and he loves to hand out subpoenas. Even people accused of no wrong-doing will likely be called in to testify about what Blagojevich said to them. This may include Obama advisors, and perhaps even Candidate 1, Valerie Jarrett. Obama confidantes in court? That's a media nightmare for a president in the very beginning of his first term.</p> <p><b>What Did Obama Know and When Did He Know It?</b> Now we learn, over a couple weeks, what role Obama and his inner circle played in this mess. Obama says he hasn't been in contact with Blago. But was he in contact with the FBI and the US Attorney? Did his campaign report the bribe requests to the FBI? Who were the bribe requests made of, exactly? Drip, drip, drip&mdash;Obama's best chance here is that he comes off as aiding an investigation into a corrupt pol, and he gets style points for aiding an investigation into a corrupt pol from his own party. But if they <i>weren't</i> directly aiding the investigation, even after the bribery... well, why not? Plus the investigation's been going on forever. How much did Obama know about it and what dealings did he have with Blago in the years before this went public?</p> <p><b>Clinton Flashback!</b> The last time a Democrat was in the White House, hundreds of pointless, vague scandals were relentlessly pursued and investigated by Republicans, congress, prosecutors, and the media. Even when one went nowhere, three more were waiting in the wings. Is this Whitewater? Both the media and congress are a little more friendly with Obama than they were with Clinton back in 1992, but this is the sort of thing that starts off a million slightly related investigations into everyone Obama's ever known. A bad omen. Time for Travelgate II!</p> <p><b>Emil Jones/Jesse Jackson Jr.</b> "Candidate 5" in the criminal complaint is either Illinois Senate President Emil Jones or Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. Obama didn't want this person appointed (which is why we think it's Emil), but Blago kept threatening to appoint him anyway, as a bargaining tool. Now. Candiate 5 was supposed to give Blago something "tangible up front." If they were willing to do this, in exchange for the seat, it looks bad for them. Emil is reported to have aided young Obama's state legislative career, back in the day, with plum assignments. And Jesse Jackson Jr is a family friend. Either way, there's a connection that <i>might</i> look bad.</p> ]]></description>

In the spirit of hope! The email can't really be "verified," but appears genuine and is just too important not to share. This firm has even assembled an official internal "Diversified Holiday Guest List," in which they rank the top 10 acceptable black socialite attendees, in order of desirability. Uh... yes we can? After the jump, meet the fashion world's ten favorite African-Americans for Obama-era parties.

			<title><![CDATA[ <i>Gossip Girl</i>: Death Becomes No One ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/GossipGirl_Dec8.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/GossipGirl_Dec8.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" />I find myself at a bit of a loss this morning to describe the Sturm und Drang that was last night's half-season-ender episode of <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged GOSSIP GIRL" href="http://gawker.com/tag/gossip-girl/">Gossip Girl</a></em>. O, Stephanie Savage. You giver of hopes, you taker awayer of those same hopes. What began as something that felt almost, <em>almost</em> like the sweepy melodrama this show should regularly be going for, eventually just yawed sideways and no one seemed to know what was up and what was down. So we were left with Aaron Rose and Serena's grandma getting more airtime than a lot of the principals. Ah well! We'll sift through the wreckage after the jump. Let's see what treasures we find!</p> <p>Bart Bass, 1836-2008. May he rest in peace. Yes! Barty is dead from a mysterious carring accident that left <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged GOSSIP GIRL" href="http://gawker.com/tag/gossip-girl/">Gossip Girl</a> as chipper as ever and the casts' costumes blacker than Chuck's beady eyes. No one was really sad at first, just sort of squishy-faced concerned like they get. Then Lily, aggrieved widow, came breezing in all nervous energy and choppy line readings. I like Kelly Rutherford a lot, but she's not exactly <em>funny.</em> Please don't try to make her <em>funny.</em> But oh well. Her moms was there too, you know, that Old Lady Who Can't Act. She's always stirring up trouble, that Old Lady Who Can't Act. She meddles and purses her lips and we just kind of sigh and shrug our shoulders because honestly how much do we care?</p> <p>Somewhere in the mix Dan and the on-the-verge-of-throwing-something-through-my-TV annoying Aaron Rose got in a foppish little battle of the Who Did Serena Text Firsts, which ended up with them both looking like the silly little Berenstain Bear and whiny rodent that they truly are, respectively. It was totally obvious that Serena wanted to head off down a sunny dirt road into a Bear Country with Dans, but there was the fact that, you know, she feels this inexplicable need to stretch out events in her life to be paced in such a way. You know, so she can <em>deal.</em> Aaron nibbled on a piece of cheese in the background and glowered at everyone. He's going to be revealed to be some sort of sinister impostor, I think. Not his character. The actor. He's been sent by some Dark Agency to glamor these people into doing unspeakable acts. That or Josh Schwartz needs to call Terminix.</p> <p>The true tour de force of the evening was Ed Westwick's wild-maned, slurry, very very angry Chuckles Bass performance. That British fool can actually act! And what a joy it was to finally see someone on this show be open and expressive and unencumbered by some silly sense of how their clothes are falling or what light they're in or what emopop ballad is jamming above them in unseen editing rooms somewhere. Here was a dude just getting into the mud of acting, and smearing it delightedly on anyone nearby. Watching Chace Crawford try to hold up his stupid end of the stupid bargain was like watching a kid with construction paper feathers glued to his arms try to fly alongside a drunken, loop-de-looping Chuck Yeager. Comical, yes. Effective for an episode about Dying? No.</p> <p>Chuckles' real rage was directed at the elders, Pa Humphrey and Lily, who he blamed for the still-unexplained death of his beloved <em>Thinner</em> actor father. They had been carryin' on somethin' untoward behind nobody's back and he was going to crush them for it. The only voice of reason was the mournful Blair, played by Leighton Meester with a new sense of whiny urgency that just didn't fit the character. The part where she told Mr. Thang that she loved him was good, but then she went into the house (where her mother was marrying a gnome) and cried the line "only a masochist could love such a narcissist" and I threw something in Stephanie Savage's general direction and yelped loudly because that is a really dreadful, dreadful line. Oh well! Like I could do better! ("Only a pharmacist could love such an allergist." Does that work?) Chuck ignored her lurve and went off to find out the mystery of Lily and Pa Humphrey, the Mystery that has hung over the show like so many invisible, undetectable particles of nothing for so many forgettable episodes. We all knew it was a secret baby anyway.</p> <p>Meanwhile, other things happened: Erik, the gay one who talks like he has ice cubes in his mouth, sorta reunited with his twinky little friend Jonathan. Jonathan's a fine name and all, but could we maybe have like Jon or Jonny? Just so it doesn't seem like the kid poops Fancy Feast and cries diamonds and is scared of big flowers. So that happened and Dan and Serena continued their little flirtation/deep need for each other and Aaron invited Serena to go to Buenos Aires, which all the actors did a good job of pretending that they knew where that was. Eleanor became the Gnome Queen and Rufus and Lily expressed love for one another and made a plan to meet and go to Cornwall, where it would be gray and icky, Lily said. At first my roommate and I thought they meant Cornwall, England and we groaned and thought it was silly, but then we figured out they meant Cornwall, CT. Of which the poet Mark Van Doren wrote "The mind, eager for caresses / Lies down at its own risk in Cornwall." Though I don't think Rufus and Lily were planning on caressing each other's <em>minds</em>, if you get my drift. I mean their privates. They wanted to touch each other's no-no special places. Then in a limo somewhere Serena let her mom pursue Rufus by staying with Aaron, who said to her "I think I might be falling in love with you." And let me tell you, if someone ever said that to me, I would throw them out a window. Don't give me the preamble without the constitution, bub. Also, don't say gross things like that.</p> <p>In the end, despite Serena's stepping aside, Rufus and Lils were not meant to be. We thought that the sour Chuck would spill the baby beans, but he kept mum and burned the document (that I imagined said: "On this day today this lady did give birth to this baby and give it away and did not tell her rockstar boyfriend. End communication") in his silly fireplace and put it in the special receptacle he had beside the hearth that is used for disposing of documents ominously burned in the fireplace. It's all very complicated. Anyway, he went mopping back to Blair and in probably some of the best, if not <em>the</em> best, blocking of the whole show ever, they had an awkward, hungry embrace. It was downright touching, I gotta say. Then of course he left later and the whole sad thing fell flat again.</p> <p>Then the Old Lady Who Can't Act showed up at Pa Humphrey's and (off screen) dropped the baby boom on him and his face curdled into a million tiny embarrassments and Dan came home all mixed emotions about Serena/Lily/Rufus/Dan/Dorota (she got mixed up in there at some point, I'm sure. "Mister Rufus, your whammy bar is so skinny.") But then he saw his Pa's angry rumple of a face and then he didn't, because Rufus went storming out.</p> <p>Smiling sweetly in the middle of busy Grand Central was Lily, with her sad little suitcases. Her smile crumbled when she saw how rockstarry mad Rufus was. "Tell me one thing," he hissed. "Was it a boy or a girl?" And then it was a girl! No, not their baby. Gossip Girl was talking! Because the episode was over! And there won't be another one until next year.</p> <p>Things that I hope will happen in the bold new future: Serena will figure out that peanut butter works in the Aaron traps she's laid around the house. Eleanor will become mad with her new gnome powers and will have to be subdued by Dorota, a secret Gnome Slayer. Dan will go to Buenos Aires to find Serena, but will be perturbed and slightly embarrassed to realize that Belgium is not where Buenos Aires is and oh my god he just wasted so much money on this plane ticket and now he's stuck in fucking Belgium. Erik and little Jonathan will open a B&B in Cornwall called the Cornwall Cornhole, which will appeal to frat boys who like butt jokes but also oddly like third-tier character twink love stories.</p> <p>And probably much, much more!</p> <p><em>PS: My roommate thinks Bart faked his death. Agree? Disagree?</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Illinois Governor Arrested For Selling Obama Senate Seat ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/obamarod.jpg" width="395" height="345" style="display:block;" />You want your Chicago-style politics? They don't come much more Chicago-style than this: Democratic Illinois Governor <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged ROD BLAGOJEVICH" href="http://gawker.com/tag/rod-blagojevich/">Rod Blagojevich</a> was just arrested, along with his chief of staff, by FBI agents. How many corrupt things can one Governor do before a new ethics law takes effect at the beginning of next year? Blagojevich was apparently trying to set some sort of <i>record.</i> And Rezko's involved! And Tribune Co! Let's start with Rod's charming decision to sell the Senate seat vacated by squeaky clean president-elect <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>!</p> <p><a href="http://cbs2chicago.com/local/rod.blagojevich.charged.2.883170.html">From the 76-page FBI affidavit:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>At various times, in exchange for the Senate appointment, Blagojevich discussed obtaining:</p> <p>A substantial salary for himself at a either a non-profit foundation or an organization affiliated with labor unions;</p> <p>Placing his wife on paid corporate boards where he speculated she might garner as much as $150,000 a year;</p> <p>Promises of campaign funds – including cash up front; and</p> <p>A cabinet post or ambassadorship for himself.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully the feds have been wiretapping Blagojevich for a month or so. "I want to make money," Rod said to John Harris, his chief of staff.</p> <p>You know who'll be thrilled to hear the news of Rod's arrest? The good people at the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> and the incompetent people at Tribune Co. Part of Blagojevich's brilliant money-making scheme involved withholding state aid to the ailing, now-bankrupt Tribune Co, unless they fired editorial board members critical of the governor. You know what is amazing? That after Rod talked to "Tribune Owner" and "Tribune Financial Advisor" regarding their attempt to offload the Chicago Cubs to the state, they called him back and promised to fire the deputy editoral page editor of the <i>Tribune.</i> Great fucking work, Sam Zell.</p> <blockquote> <p>In a November 11 intercepted call, Harris allegedly told Blagojevich that Tribune Financial Advisor talked to Tribune Owner and Tribune Owner "got the message and is very sensitive to the issue." Harris told Blagojevich that according to Tribune Financial Advisor, there would be "certain corporate reorganizations and budget cuts coming and, reading between the lines, he's going after that section." Blagojevich allegedly responded. "Oh. That's fantastic." After further discussion, Blagojevich said, "Wow. Okay, keep our fingers crossed. You're the man. Good job, John."</p> <p>In a further conversation on November 21, Harris told Blagojevich that he had singled out to Tribune Financial Advisor the Tribune's deputy editorial page editor, John McCormick, "as somebody who was the most biased and unfair." After hearing that Tribune Financial Advisor had assured Harris that the Tribune would be making changes affecting the editorial board, Blagojevich allegedly had a series of conversations with Chicago Cubs representatives regarding efforts to provide state financing for Wrigley Field.</p> </blockquote> <p><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>, wisely, distanced himself from Blagojevich during his run for the presidency. But the wonderful thing about the Chicago political machine is that basically no one elected to anything in that town is clean. Good thing for our President-elect that he won the election before <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged PATRICK FITZGERALD" href="http://gawker.com/tag/patrick-fitzgerald/">Patrick Fitzgerald</a> made his move.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Jay Leno Moves to 10 p.m. in NBC Shakeup ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/81718249.jpg" alt="81718249.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" /><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged JAY LENO" title="Click here to read more posts tagged JAY LENO" href="http://gawker.com/tag/jay-leno/">Jay Leno</a> will stay at NBC and move to 10pm weeknight slot after <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CONAN O'BRIEN" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CONAN O'BRIEN" href="http://gawker.com/tag/conan-o.brien/">Conan O'Brien</a> takes over his <em>Tonight Show</em> in June, <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/CA6620935.html">Broadcasting &amp; Cable</a> and <a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/source-nbc-may-strip-leno-at-10-pm/">Nikki Finke</a> are reporting. Everyone thought Leno was probably going to end up at ABC after he said in a July interview "<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-16-leno-cover_N.htm?csp=34">I am definitely done next year</a> — with NBC." But NBC Universal chief <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged JEFF ZUCKER" title="Click here to read more posts tagged JEFF ZUCKER" href="http://gawker.com/tag/jeff-zucker/">Jeff Zucker</a> persuaded him to stay! Probably with wheelbarrows full of money. The big loser in all this? That would probably be embattled NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman, who just survived a <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996916.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1">major</a> corporate <a href="http://defamer.com/5104880/i-am-silverman-the-last-nbc-exec-on-earth">bloodletting</a> but suddenly finds himself with five fewer hours a week to program. And to think he was having so much fun <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/12/nbc_may_scale_back_the_number.html">skiing in Utah</a> this weekend!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/83945336.jpg" alt="83945336.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" />Just last week, the <em>Washington Post</em> reported NBC was running out of shows, "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/03/AR2008120303862.html">in what might be a broadcast-TV first</a>." That would be a clear demerit on Silverman's report card.</p> <p>He's been <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/12/did_ben_silverman.html">trying to shift blame</a> for NBC's many recent stumbles over to fellow executive Katherine Pope. But he neglects to mention that NBC also canned Teri Weinberg, who Silverman deputized as his number two even though she had "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/17/business/fi-silverman17">no experience at a network or managing a large staff</a>" and whose boyfriend also got a nice producing deal. This handpicked Silverman team was, predictably, a "<a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/major-nbc-shakeup-ahead-network-wants-to-ax-teri-weinberg-hopes-ben-silverman-quits/">train wreck</a>."</p> <p>Silverman's contract is up in June, which means he would normally be starting renegotiations any time now. It's hard to imagine him doing as well as Leno, who may have been bumped, and who risks losing his audience, but at least is still profitably employed.</p> <p>Bigger picture: NBC now has three late-night shows each weeknight (Jimmy Fallon is taking over O'Brien's <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged LATE NIGHT" title="Click here to read more posts tagged LATE NIGHT" href="http://gawker.com/tag/late-night/">Late Night</a></em>), a development critics are sure to hail as another nail in the coffin of traditional, scripted primetime network television, already under siege by reality shows and expensive dramas on HBO, Showtime, AMC, etc. But it could just be that Ben Silverman sucks. Or both! We vote for both!</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ The Tribune Company Is Bankrupt ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/zelltrib.jpeg" width="340" height="273" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>The Tribune Company, owner of the<em> LA Times</em> and <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, has filed for bankruptcy. <em>Bummer</em>. Pretty much everyone saw this coming. The company is $12 billion in debt, its revenues are going steadily downward, it's been having round after round of layoffs, and it's run by an angry (but honest!) <a href="http://gawker.com/tag/sam-zell/">billionaire gnome</a> and a <a href="http://gawker.com/tag/lee-abrams/">Ron Jeremy doppelganger</a> of questionable sanity. Its papers will keep publishing, but working journalists are sure to get even more royally screwed before this is all over&mdash;their pension plan actually owns the company. Key details below:</p> <p>From the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2008-12/43780244.pdf">press release</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>The company will continue to operate its media businesses during the restructuring, including publishing its newspapers and running its television stations and interactive properties without interruption, and has sufficient cash to do so.<br /> The Chicago Cubs franchise, including Wrigley Field, is not included in the Chapter 11 filing. Efforts to monetize the Cubs and its related assets will continue.</p></blockquote> <p>The LAT says the company has $300 million cash, which is enough for the short term but not for the long term. Zell told employees that their health care and 401k plans would not be affected. </p> <p>Zell's Tribune buyout may go down as the worst media purchase of the decade. Sorry, guys. At least you still have time to sell the Cubs.

			<title><![CDATA[ Everyone But Hillary Loves Caroline Kennedy ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/caroline.jpg" height="371" width="280" />Supposedly, Governor Paterson is going to appoint <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CAROLINE KENNEDY" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CAROLINE KENNEDY" href="http://gawker.com/tag/caroline-kennedy/">Caroline Kennedy</a> to serve the remainder of <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HILLARY CLINTON" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HILLARY CLINTON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a>'s Senate term. <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CAROLINE KENNEDY" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CAROLINE KENNEDY" href="http://gawker.com/tag/caroline-kennedy/">Caroline Kennedy</a> is basically the only Kennedy left who everyone <i>likes.</i>We like her, don't you? The lady Kennedys have historically been much more tolerable than the men Kennedys of course, and now all we have left of them anyway are smug RFK Jr and sad old Ted and some drunk kids and, uh, <a href="http://wonkette.com/171828/patrick-kennedy-drinking-or-pill-popping">Patrick Kennedy.</a> So Caroline: the Kennedy it's still cool to like! Unless you're <i><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HILLARY CLINTON" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HILLARY CLINTON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a>.</i></p> <p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/12082008/news/columnists/paterson_cool_on_caroline_143173.htm">According to Fredric Dicker</a>, Paterson is actually not leaning toward appointing Kennedy, because she is "quiet and non-assertive," and a New York Senator needs to be a huge dick all the time, like Chuck Schumer. Also, well, there is this little problem:</p> <blockquote><p>"Why would she want to see that seat go to someone who essentially double-crossed her?" the source said, noting the Kennedy family's endorsement of Obama in the primary. "It's a nightmare scenario for her."</p></blockquote> <p>Yes! Clinton/Kennedy bitchery! The primaries will never, ever end!</p> <p><a href="http://blog.newser.com/post/2008/12/8/Caroline-Runs.aspx">But as Michael Wolff says</a>, we should probably just give Caroline Kennedy the seat anyway, even though Hillary hates her, because she's Caroline Kennedy, and she seems pretty cool. Assertiveness aside, she is also basically the ultimate insider, which is a good tool for getting things done in the chummy Senate.</p> <blockquote><p>When the New York Post pursued a story about antics (Kennedy-type antics) involving her then 18-year-old daughter, Caroline went to Rupert Murdoch’s primary aide, Gary Ginsberg, formerly her brother John’s right-hand-man, who went to Murdoch, who quashed the Post’s story. In turn, she wrote a letter to Brearley, the private school in Manhattan where she sits on the board, when Murdoch’s daughter, Grace, was applying for kindergarten there.</p> <p>Likewise, when Murdoch wanted an audience with Barack Obama, he went through Caroline (who, at that moment, was riding with Barack Obama in his car). All this is not in any way an indictment of her insiderism. Indeed, the attraction to her is precisely because she seems like the ultimate insider, the person who most knows the truth about power and celebrity, and the darkness of American public life (everybody else has to claw their way to insider status, compromising themselves as they climb the pole—she was born inside).</p></blockquote> <p>So hooray for a potential new Senator Kennedy who hasn't killed anyone and isn't dying! Seriously, Paterson, everyone else on the shortlist sucks, unless you want to send Bloomberg to Washington so he'll <i>stop bothering us here.</i></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Girls Drinkier than Usual These Days on Demon Rum, Alcopops ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228748258689_drunkgirls2.jpg" width="158" height="160" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2">Everyone knows that girls can't metabolize their alcohol like boys! That's why they're always staggering out of Mansion at 4 a.m., vomiting, crying, and curling up on the sidewalk like baby deer. In the last ten years, the ones who didn't drink much are now drinking, and the ones who already drank are drinking more, <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/52758/">reports <em>New York Mag</em></a>. Their article on women and drinking is basically a public service announcement: <I>What is happening to America's girls</i>?</p> <p>The factors: stress, crazy jobs, keeping up with the boys, postwar equality ("As women ‘immigrated’ into the culture that was once unique to men,” says [a professor], “they picked up a lot of the same mores and attitudes and behaviors and ideas about what is socially acceptable that men had previously held.")<br /> <blockquote>Not all of my female friends drink like Kate, but most of them do drink—and not just in a glass-of-wine-with-dinner way. Drinking is our go-to activity. Meeting a friend implies going to a bar. Having a meal implies a round of cocktails beforehand. A party implies a serious hangover. Drinking feels like our prerogative—if we want to get blasted at the company Christmas party or nurse a bottle of scotch through the holidays, no one should, or can, stop us.</p></blockquote> <p>Well... <i>yeah</i>! Is this wrong?</p> <p>OH and then they quote an IM conversation (<i>an IM conversation made into a blog post!</i>) between "two editors at [our sister site] Jezebel.com":</p> <blockquote><p>"FEMINIST ONE: You would be proud of me. I drank alone last night!</p> <p>FEMINIST TWO: I am proud! I should have called you. I was too drunk.</p> <p>FEMINIST ONE: I opened a bottle of wine—a good bottle that I had been saving—poured some into a juice glass, and watched The Age of Love. My dad called, and he was like, “You know that drinking doesn’t solve things long-term?” And I was like, um, that’s a lie.</p> <p>FEMINIST TWO: Hahahaha!</p> <p>FEMINIST ONE: I know. I was so serious too.</p> <p>FEMINIST TWO: Yeah, it solves things long-term, as long as you commit to drinking.</p> <p>FEMINIST ONE: I told him booze was no different from Klonopin and it’s cheaper!</p></blockquote> <p>Unless you get the Klonopin generic! </p> <p>"And so alcohol is our choice to soothe us in times of trouble, celebrate with us in times of joy, engage us in times of boredom. We use it to change our mood, to forget our problems, to give us courage, to access some essential, uncensored, better self," the article concludes, which means: OK, so, women like to drink for more-or-less the same reasons men like to drink! <I>Is that so wrong</i>? Please drink and metabolize your alcohol responsibly, everyone. Or whatever.<br /> <br /></p> ]]></description>

People are literally <a href="http://gawker.com/5099813/wal+mart-employee-killed-in-black-friday-stampede">making a killing at the discount stores.</a> But you, bedraggled and drunken procrastinator, you probably won't get started with your shopping until the 23rd or so. And then it will be a mad dash. What to buy? And for whom?? Well, after the jump I'll give you a few helpful suggestions that ought to help expedite the process a wee bit. Print the list out, file it away, then go back to lying on the rug and drinking spiced eggnog from a mug with a straw and laughing dimly at <em>George Lopez</em> reruns.</p> <p><u>For the boy who...</u></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228670242684_sopranos2.jpg" width="158" height="119" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"/><strong>...likes to imagine he's walking in slow motion and furtively writes screenplays about things like a bookie who falls in love with a hooker and has to shoot his way out of a bad situation:</strong> Um, duhhh. <a href="http://store.hbo.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3201041&cp=1885646">The complete <em>Sopranos</em> series on DVD</a>. It comes, of course, with a bunch of extras that he can watch and bone up on so when he's not showing off his new leather coat or talking about the time he went clubbing "in the city" and Vin Diesel was there, he can "impress" ladies with mob minutiae. And it only costs $399.99!</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228670203682_aw__liza.png" width="158" height="158" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/><strong>...hung some beads off the rear view mirror of his VW Bug, waits tables at the Cheesecake Factory and calls everybody Miss Thang out of the house but back at home mostly stays in his room, from which muffled sobs and/or singing can be heard:</strong> Christmas with a Z, naturally! Buy him tickets to <em>Liza's at the Palace...</em>, the indefatigable Minnelli's latest <a href="http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/theater/reviews/05liza.html">well reviewed</a> cabaret act cum Kay Thompson homage. It closes on the 28th, so make it an early present. He'll wait by the stage door, meet her, and then drive around town in that silly car of his, feeling a little bit special for a few days. </p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228670238869_video-games.jpeg.jpg" width="158" height="221" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"/><strong>...always has a slight orangey Cheetos tint to his hands, doesn't shave (if he even needs to shave) a lot, and kinda smells.

In federal government buildings. Sure, he went on to say that he's planning a massive public works project to build roads and schools, but it reminds us why <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> has been sticking to his "one president at a time" line: first, he doesn't want to be stuck in the political trap of taking responsibility for the nation before he has the power to do anything, and second, actual governing is boring. Which may be why our current president decided to skip it entirely.</p> ]]></description>

Please don't say "It's the economy, stupid." That's really annoying. Of course it<em> is </em>the economy, but this week has been bad even by the standards of the last three months. Because it has special qualities! Qualities that, unfortunately, conspired to screw thousands of people out of employment. After the jump, we'll have a little review of the most recent bad news, and explain why everybody got executed just after they finished their last Thanksgiving leftovers.</p> <p>What's happened since Thanksgiving?</p> <p><ul></p> <p><li>Viacom <a href="http://gawker.com/5101825/the-dreaded-viacom-layoffs-850-people">laid off 850</a>.</li> <li>NBC Universal <a href="http://gawker.com/5101893/nbc-universal-hacking-staff-everywhere-today">laid off 500</a></li> <li><em>Newsday </em><a href="http://gawker.com/5102726/100-layoffs-at-newsday">laid off 100</a>.</li> <li><em>People</em> finished <a href="http://gawker.com/5102204/blas-people-editor-confirms-layoffs">laying off 18</a>.</li> <li>Simon & Schuster <a href="http://gawker.com/5101443/layoffs-at-simon--schuster">laid off 35.</a> </li> <li>Niche Media <a href="http://gawker.com/5101579/niche-media-folds-atlanta-mag">folded a magazine</a>.</li> <li>Tragedy <a href="http://gawker.com/5101084/comings-and-goings-at-gawker">on the homefront</a>.</li> <li>Google announced it's <a href="http://gawker.com/5101443/layoffs-at-simon--schuster">cutting its fancy job perks</a>.</li> <li>Sotheby's and Christie's <a href="http://gawker.com/5102763/going-once-going-twice-your-job">announced pending layoffs</a>.</li> <li>In the corporate world, there are major layoffs going down at AT&T (12,000 workers), <a href="http://gawker.com/5101443/layoffs-at-simon--schuster">Goldman Sachs,</a> Carlyle Group, Credit Suisse, and tons of other financial firms.</li> <li>The big picture: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/dec2008/db2008124_194018.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story">533,000 US job losses in November.</a></li> </ul><br /> <br />The economy only determines the need to<em> have</em> layoffs. Companies determine when and how to announce them. And no matter how cold-hearted a corporation is, long experience has proven that you will be made to regret laying off <em>anyone</em> too close to one of the more heartwarming holidays. </p> <p>Thanksgiving and Christmas are the #2 and #1 most heartwarming holidays, respectively (according to science). That means the week of each holiday is totally out for layoff announcements. It's also bad form to fire people as soon as they return to work from their nice holiday. However! The flipside is that many companies are desperate to clear out everyone they want to get rid of before the end of the year. In practical terms, that means that the layoff machine paused in the week of Thanksgiving; it gave people a few days to get settled back in after they went home and gave thanks; and now, this week, KABLAMOOIEZAMMO. Layoffs everywhere. </p> <p>Also an acceptable time, from a PR perspective: next week. Expect there to be many more layoffs then. Once we move into the second half of December, though, it's dangerously close to Christmas. Companies risk being branded (more) heartless (than usual). So we'll see a relatively quiet last couple of weeks in December. But a mad rush before then&mdash;which we're in the midst of right now.</p> <p>Ideally, everything would then be taken care of, so workers could come back for the new year secure in their jobs. In reality, who the fuck knows? Unless you work for Campbell's Soup, don't get too comfy.

			<title><![CDATA[ OJ Gets 15 Years in Actual Prison ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/OJ_Sentenced.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/OJ_Sentenced.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" />Our long national nightmare of not seeing justice done in one high-profile crime is over! <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged OJ SIMPSON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/oj-simpson/">OJ Simpson</a> was just sentenced, and now journalists across the nation are trying to figure out all the fancy law talk to see just how much time OJ will spend in jail. The judge was <i>very</i> disappointed in the Juice, even though <a href="http://gawker.com/5102684/before-he-goes-to-prison-oj-is-very-very-sorry">he was very very sorry</a>, and OJ will be in jail for <strike>5</strike> 6 years before he can make parole. The full sentence is 15, we think, though hopefully the AP or someone will let us correct that soon (oh <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=081205182132.kownc7ye&show_article=1">hey</a>). This means the world will finally get closure on a 14-year-old circus. We finally get to see OJ in prison! We never thought we'd see the day!</p> <p>[Unrelated rant: Our half-paying attention to the sentencing is better than CNN did, at least.What the shit is wrong with Kyra Phillips? In addition to introducing the sentencing by bitching like a talk radio caller about how OJ is the most evil man alive, she followed up the judge by announcing that she hadn't been paying attention and was unable to follow the sentencing. She can't follow the sentencing? It's 15 years, six years until possibility of parole. (Counting some consecutive sentences it's maybe 18 years? That is part we missed.) Philips explained the news to her viewers like they were children. "He used a gun, and he's going to the slammer." Off to commercial!]</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Tina Fey Is Funny, But Also Kind Of Mean ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/Liz_Bully.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/Liz_Bully.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" />Last night's <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged 30 ROCK" href="http://gawker.com/tag/30-rock/">30 Rock</a></em> seemed a bit familiar, didn't it? It felt like something we'd read was just being basically reiterated to us, with a lot more jokes. The episode took place mostly at Liz's 20 year high school reunion, and we came to see that she was an acidic loner at her suburban Philadelphia school, with extra weight and big silly eyebrows. Where have we heard this tale before? Oh! Yes! Of course! In the cover story on creator/star <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged TINA FEY" href="http://gawker.com/tag/tina-fey/">Tina Fey</a> for <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/tina_fey200901">this month's <em>Vanity Fair</em>!</a> Snide. But, y'know, funny.</p> <p><br clear="all"> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/041608_fey88_240x320.jpg" width="240" height="320" class="right">In the article she cops to being a bit of a nerdy weirdo joke-making loner in high school, and much is made of her biting mean streak. Which was... basically what the episode was about. Liz pictured herself as a quiet, put-upon nerd in high school. Everyone else remembers her as a quick-with-the-nasty-joke tormenting bully. We're sure the actual truth of Fey's adolescence is somewhere in the middle. But we gotta be honest, while the episode was hysterical as always, we feel a little cooled to Fey after the <em>VF</em> piece. Maybe it's seething jealousy, and maybe it's worry that if we were to meet her, she'd tear us down to size in about two seconds.</p> <p>That said, we wonder what she thinks about <a href="http://www.philebrity.com/2008/12/04/from-the-desk-of-conor-corcoran-im-not-certain-but-im-pretty-sure-i-might-have-made-out-with-tina-fey-in-the-seventh-grade/#more-17468">this Philly dude who says he "made out" with her</a> when he was in seventh grade. It's probably something snide. But, y'know, funny.</p> ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/robfb2_01.jpg" alt="robfb2.JPG" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2">[<strong>Update:</strong> The purported Pattinson pen-pal, Ben Coles, called us to deny that he was speaking with the <i>Twilight</i> star. Read more from Coles <a href="http://gawker.com/5104175/twilight-star-impersonated-on-facebook">here</a>.] Swirling around the release of <em>Twilight</em>, the <a href="http://gawker.com/5096120/in-which-i-try-to-explain-twilight?skyline=true&amp;s=x">terrible</a> but <a href="http://gawker.com/5097578/twilight--laughed-at-by-youngs-beloved-by-olds">terribly successful</a> vampire romance movie, were <a href="http://gossipteen.com/2008/11/21/robert-pattinson-and-kristen-stewart-twilight-romance/">rumors of a hookup</a> between stars <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged KRISTEN STEWART" href="http://gawker.com/tag/kristen-stewart/">Kristen Stewart</a> and heartthrob <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged ROBERT PATTINSON" title="Click here to read more posts tagged ROBERT PATTINSON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/robert-pattinson/">Robert Pattinson</a>. This sounded like so much publicity fodder for the film's teenage target demos. This might be more of the same: A tipster forwarded the following screenshots, purportedly of a Pattinson Facebook account under the alias of Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson's character in <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>).</p> <p>We are told the account was hacked, and images spread to various Web forums. (We were able to dig up a <a href="http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:JEbbzVsvPYsJ:robertpattinson.org/forum/viewthread.php%3Ftid%3D2747%26page%3D1+Randle+Patrick+McMurphy+pattinson&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us">since-yanked reference</a> to the account on a Pattinson fan site, but nothing more.) One image does indeed show McMurphy, purportedly aka Pattinson, alluding to hooking up with Stewart, while another shows chats with another girl. All in all, it's pretty tame stuff, making for a perfect publicity stunt for the still-in-theaters film. Although it's also plausible the account was genuine; Pattinson would follow everyone <a href="http://gawker.com/5010935/kristian-lalibertes-identity-stolen-how-will-he-know-who-he-is">from Kristian Laliberte</a> to <a href="http://gawker.com/5050141/fake-prince-williams-facebook-fools-a+list-friends">Prince William's friends</a> in being taken in by Facebook mischief makers &mdash; not to mention poor Paris Hilton and her sidekick phone.

"[His] cock may be sore from the hours of blow jobs here but he retains his good humor," <a href="http://twitter.com/anamariecox/status/1039398133"><em>Time</em>'s Ana Marie Cox wrote from the frenzied mob.</a> That's only half a joke: Gibbs may not be a hottie in the conventional sense (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgn6rjGbp0c">except in a dogfight</a>), but if you're a journalist soon to cover the president-elect &mdash; and who isn't, on some level? &mdash; you better start the kissing up as soon as possible (preferably three years ago). Luckily for the Obama supplicants, this administration is considerably younger and hotter than the last, and even tops the Clinton administration, with its charming young George Stephanopoulos, the It Boy of his administration.</p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/SafariScreenSnapz004_01.jpg" alt="SafariScreenSnapz004.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"> There are, of course, other coveted White House liaisons beyond Gibbs. The top picks:</p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/SafariScreenSnapz005_01.jpg" alt="SafariScreenSnapz005.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"><strong>Jon Favreau, 27, top speechwriter</strong> : Not to be confused with the actor from <em>Swingers</em>. How did he get Rob Lowe's <em>West Wing</em> job at such a young age? Worked for the John Kerry campaign right out of college and met Obama backstage at the convention. He couldn't get dates during the campaign, due both to the rigors of the trail and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/fashion/20speechwriter.html?sq=jon%20favreau&amp;st=cse&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;scp=2&amp;adxnnlx=1228454381-lDCfer3EXfpG7+h4XSfetg">skeptical girls</a>: "There’s been a few times when people have said, ‘I don’t believe you, that you’re <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>’s speechwriter.' To which I reply, ‘If I really wanted to hit on you, don’t you think I’d make up something more outlandish?’ ”</p> <p><a href="http://twitter.com/anamariecox/statuses/1025358990">Cox</a>: "No matter what happens in the Obama transition, one thing is for sure: Jon Favreau will still get laid as often as he wants."</p> <p>Favreau isn't going to be able to do much for you immediately, like write you into a speech or whatever, so throw yourself at him if you're young and can afford to make a long-term investment in the future.

That' s positively flirty by <em>Economist</em> standards! And you-all have already demanded him <a href="http://gawker.com/5096349/obama-selects-money+fixer#c9065858">topless in a fundraising calendar</a>.</p> <p>Now you know who you have to blow to get a government bailout around here! Although he's been married for more than 20 years, so you probably won't get past flirting.</p> <p>UPDATE: <a href="http://wonkette.com/404728/catfight-geithner-doesnt-like-bair#more-404728">He's kind of a dick who hates the poors</a>.

But he's married, too, so prepare for disappointment. Although there are probably plenty of OTHER things the second-most-powerful man in the world could do that would make you happy (like having your enemies audited).</p> <p>We're probably forgetting, like, half the cabinet, so post your nominations in the comments or <a href="mailto:tips@gawker.com">send them by email</a>. Especially if you know some <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged OBAMA HOTTIES" href="http://gawker.com/tag/obama-hotties/">Obama hotties</a> of the female persuasion.

We heard earlier that as many as <a href="http://gawker.com/5101778/mtv-closing-rhapsody-office">300 layoffs </a>might be coming at MTV today, but the total, Viacom-wide numbers are even worse: 850 people are being cut, about 7% of the company's global staff. And top management is "suspending salary increases" next year, if it makes you peons feel any better. The full internal memo that went out this morning is after the jump; if you know more about the specific breakdown of the layoffs, <a href="mailto:tips@gawker.com">email us</a>. <strong>UPDATES</strong>: additional memos from MTV and Paramount added below:</p> <p><br clear="all" /></p> <blockquote><p>Dear Colleagues:</p> <p>With less than a month until the close of 2008, our entire organization continues to do everything possible to anticipate and adapt to the unprecedented changes affecting all our businesses. We know it hasn't been easy and we couldn't be more proud or more appreciative of how you have risen to the challenge.</p> <p>Even in these tough economic times, Viacom has a strong hand to play. We have a broad stable of outstanding brands, diverse revenue streams and an impressive global footprint, backed up by exceptional financial strength. Added to that we have talented employees, extremely able leaders and a creative ingenuity that runs deep.</p> <p>Unfortunately, our advantages and best efforts can't completely protect Viacom from the very serious and broad-based challenges of this economic recession. Viacom's long-term health will depend on our shared commitment to adapt, to innovate and to make difficult choices. To compete and thrive, we need to create an organization and a cost structure that are in step with the evolving economic environment.</p> <p>Today, we are announcing a company-wide restructuring plan that includes staffing reductions in all divisions. This will result in a reduction of our worldwide workforce of approximately 7 percent, or about 850 positions. We are also suspending salary increases for the Company's senior level management in 2009. In addition, after a comprehensive review of our operations, we will write down certain programming and other assets. These three actions will bring us significant cost savings and other efficiencies.</p> <p>Top managers at every part of the company worked thoughtfully, carefully and compassionately to create a leaner, more focused organization. It was not an easy task, but it was an essential step that will keep Viacom at the competitive forefront today and tomorrow. Department heads and supervisors will provide you with more information about the changes that will be taking place in your division.</p> <p>Saying goodbye to friends and colleagues is always difficult, particularly when we have shared so much. Those of you who will be leaving should be proud of your contributions, which we will always respect and appreciate. We thank you and we wish you the best.</p> <p>The true measure of an organization is how it deals with change and overcomes challenges. We know that you are up to the task and that together we will push through the difficulties ahead and go on to even greater achievements.</p> <p>We truly appreciate your continued commitment and hard work and we thank you for everything you do each day. </p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Philippe and Tom </p></blockquote> <p>From MTV's Judy McGrath to employees:</p> <blockquote><p>I'm sure you've read Philippe and Tom's note, and I want to talk to<br /> you about what it means for MTV Networks – today and in the context of<br /> our overall mission and strategy going forward.</p> <p>We all know there's a fundamental restructuring of our entire economy<br /> going on, and it extends beyond our borders. This is not just about<br /> MTVN, Viacom or even sister media companies – it's happening in every<br /> industry, all over the world. This doesn't make it easier to say<br /> goodbye to people we love and respect, but it is the hard truth. In<br /> these tough times, we are responsible for sustaining and reinventing<br /> our company as thoughtfully as we can. The changes we're making today<br /> are necessary, difficult, and the responsible way for us to move<br /> forward.</p> <p>Here in the U.S., we're consolidating some groups, centralizing<br /> functions and outsourcing others, and aligning our resources across<br /> brands and platforms. Specific details of the changes and how they<br /> affect you and your group will be communicated by your department<br /> heads today. Our International organization continues to implement a<br /> new approach to structure and operations, which has been underway<br /> throughout the year. Further moves will be outlined by the leadership<br /> of each MTVNI region.</p> <p>Change like this is so tough, to say the least. But we must accept<br /> that we operate today in a state of constant evolution, constant<br /> change.</p> <p>We believe the next chapter for each of us will be all about new<br /> possibilities, creativity and invention. This is where our<br /> opportunity lies. We can use this moment of global transformation to<br /> reassert our capacity to innovate, to inspire through creative and<br /> business excellence, to connect with our audience as powerfully as<br /> ever. We will be a leaner organization, but we will always be<br /> champions of new ideas, champions of all of our customers and brands,<br /> and leaders in new ways of doing business.</p> <p>Everyone here contributes to MTVN and Viacom every single day and<br /> night without exception. We hate to see dedicated friends and<br /> co-workers leave us, and we say goodbye with care, gratitude, support<br /> and respect.</p> <p>Thank you all for your continued commitment to MTV Networks.</p> <p>&mdash; Judy</p></blockquote> <p>From Paramount's Brad Grey [via <a href="http://weblogs.variety.com/hal/2008/12/viacom-announce.html">Variety</a>]:</p> <blockquote><p>Dear Colleagues:<br /> By now, you all have seen the email from Philippe Dauman and Tom Dooley regarding Viacom's cost-saving initiatives, which are designed to better position the Company in this difficult economic climate. Like all other divisions of the Company, Paramount too is adapting to the changing conditions and, as a result, we will reduce our global workforce. </p> <p>These reductions are across the studio: accounting, business/legal affairs, corporate and government affairs, home entertainment, human resources, information technology, production, studio lot operations and Vantage. The vast majority of affected employees will be notified today in the United States and in the coming days internationally. We wish them the best, and thank them for their many contributions to Paramount.</p> <p>Without question, the changes we implement today required us to make difficult choices. We take these steps after a careful analysis of our overall business and as part of a broader strategy to overcome the challenges of this unusual time in the market and to chart a successful course for the future.</p> <p>As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the strength of our slate, the quality of our creative partners, the innovation we see on the lot every day and the projects we have in development. These assets, coupled with your talent and hard work, I believe will enable us to remain strong over the long term. </p></blockquote> ]]></description>

The Congresswoman hung up on <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> <em>twice</em> today, and <em>then</em> put out a press release about it, and <em>THEN mis-spelled "Barak's" name (and the name of his chief of staff) <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/12/an-actual-press.html">in the press release</a>.</em> Surely what's going on here is that Ros-Lehtinen, the longest-serving woman in Congress and <a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28982833_ITM">no stranger to embarrassment</a>, has learned all too well the apparent lesson of <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SARAH PALIN" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SARAH PALIN" href="http://gawker.com/tag/sarah-palin/">Sarah Palin</a>'s <a href="http://gawker.com/5073740/sarah-palin-gets-pranked-by-crafty-canadians">crank call from fake Nicolas Sarkozy</a>: Dense politicians should not attempt to talk to famous strangers on the phone. But she's still incredibly stupid, as revealed by the hilarious chronology of events she published today:</p> <p><ul> <li>"Ros-Lehtinen received a call on her cell from a Chicago based phone number and an aide informed her that President-Elect Obama wished to speak to her.</li></p> <p> <li>"A gentleman sounding like Obama introduced himself when Ros-Lehtinen cut him off and said that 'I’m sorry but I think this is a joke from one of the South Florida radio stations known for these pranks'</li></p> <p> <li>"and hung up.</li></p> <p> <li>"Cong. and Chief of Staff designate Rahm Emmanuel (sic) called Ileana and stated 'Ileana, I cannot believe that you hung up on the President-Elect.' Ros-Lehtinen told Rahm that she didn’t believe the call was legitimate</li></p> <p> <li>"and hung up on Emmanuel (sic).</li></p> <p> <li>"A staffer to the Congresswoman informed her that Chairman Howard Berman of the Foreign Affairs Committee needed to speak with her urgently. When Chairman Berman called, Ros-Lehtinen <strong>urged him to recount a story only both of them would know <span style="font-weight: normal;">[emphasis added]</span></strong>, which he did, and told her that she had indeed hung up on the President-Elect."</li> </ul></p> <p>Then Obama called this insane lady again, telling her "it is very funny that you have twice hung up on me," by which he meant, "please tell me what you would like to see happen in Cuba, so that I know how <em>not</em> to conduct diplomacy there, because you sure suck at that kind of thing."</p> <p>Being idiotic is basically incurable, and was Palin's real problem to begin with, not the red herring crank call thing.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Who's Behind the Campaign to Smear Wendi Deng Murdoch? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228330136861_83640716_01.jpg" width="340" height="295" />Sometimes the mere existence of a rumor is as interesting as the rumor itself, and the recent surge of people breathlessly telling us that <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged WENDI DENG" title="Click here to read more posts tagged WENDI DENG" href="http://gawker.com/tag/wendi-deng/">Wendi Deng</a> Murdoch is cuckolding News Corp. <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged RUPERT MURDOCH" title="Click here to read more posts tagged RUPERT MURDOCH" href="http://gawker.com/tag/rupert-murdoch/">Rupert Murdoch</a> certainly falls into that category. In the last couple weeks, three separate people have come forward to tell us Deng is having an affair with <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CHRIS DEWOLFE" title="Click here to read more posts tagged CHRIS DEWOLFE" href="http://gawker.com/tag/chris-dewolfe/">Chris DeWolfe</a>, a MySpace founder who now works for Rupert after News Corp. purchased the social network three years ago for $580 million. It's pretty clear there is a campaign underway to get this story out. And whoever it is has finally <a href="http://www.jossip.com/wendi-murdoch-likes-her-wolves-20081203/">found an outlet to bite</a>. There's certainly no shortage of people who might have an ax to grind against Murdoch, Deng or even DeWolfe. If you have any idea who's behind it, please <a href="mailto:gabriel@gawker.com">email me</a>.</p> <p>The rumor itself is actually at least 18 months old &mdash; we first heard it last year after a reporter at a major business magazine got the News Corp. nuclear treatment when he rang up the flacks to ask whether they had made out at a party &mdash; largely spurred by Deng <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/06/28/myspace-china-deng-markets-equity-cx_jc_0628markets2.html">being named the "chief of strategy" at MySpace China</a> last summer, putting her in close (business) contact with DeWolfe. And then <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2007/09/07/will-wendi-pad-her-myspace-pals-payday">there were reports </a>that DeWolfe was using his friendship with Deng in his negotiations for a new compensation package with News Corp. </p> <p>The first time in the most recent spate of tips was in the form of an an email from someone using the <i>Dark Knight</i> pseudonym "Harvey Dent" and was pre-written in gossip-columnese ("What media mogul billionaire’s wife has been guilty of so many sexual escapades that she is the talk of LA?"), but it also made some amateurish mistakes, such as referring to "Wendy Deng." The second tipster came from inside a media organization that's locked horns with News Corp. plenty of times in the past. The third was the most aggressive. Their first account was that they had heard that someone with a grudge against Murdoch had hired a private investigator who had discovered that Deng was involved with "Chris DeWitt." Asked why someone was digging dirt on Rupert, they said it was "more of a personal interest." </p> <p>None of the new tipsters have offered any new evidence to made us think it's true. Like the Jossip item, all leaned heavily on the detail that they're hooking up at 141 Prince St. But that's <a href="http://www.observer.com/1999/rupert-murdoch-wins-6-5-million-battle-prince-street">hardly a secret address</a>. <strike>since that's where the Murdochs <i>live</i> when they're in New York.</strike> And as someone familiar with the Murdochs points out, <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15263/">they sold that apartment in 2005</a> and now live on Fifth Ave. So color us skeptical. Though, of course, if you know more than our previous tipsters, we're interested in that, too.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Obama Cabinet Scandal: Where's Bill Richardson's Beard? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/richardson_Beard.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/richardson_Beard.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" />Today, <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> had his, what, fifteenth press conference in two weeks or something, to introduce America to his Secretary of Commerce, New Mexico Governor <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BILL RICHARDSON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/bill-richardson/">Bill Richardson</a>. The assembled press had a very important question for the president-elect and his appointee: what happened to <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BILL RICHARDSON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/bill-richardson/">Bill Richardson</a>'s awesome primaries beard? Obama acknowledged his frustration with Richardson's decision to shave: "We're deeply disappointed with the loss of the beard," he said. Is this why Richardson didn't get the State job? Sure, the beard and also the fact that he's kind of a buffoon.</p> <p>Here's what you need to know about new Secretary of Commerce Bill Richardson: the former UN Secretary <i>really</i> wanted a foreign policy gig, but he's terrible with foreign policy, having been incoherent about <i>both</i> Gulf Wars and supporting the Contras and also persecuting Wen Ho Lee (<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bizreports/ci_11123347">so the Chinese hate him</a>). He's also shitty on domestic policy, but less dangerous, especially at Commerce. He was owed a position for supporting Obama over Clinton, his old boss. He has a bad habit of <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0307/3054.html">being grabby with ladies.</a> He used to have a beard. He's a free-trader who decided, after pushing NAFTA, that he is now a "fair trader."</p> <p>But yes he's mostly harmless.</p> ]]></description>

The golden fishboy should, by all rights, have fallen out of the spotlight by now. It's been what, like, four months since he won any Olympic medals? Old news. But by god people just love this goofy <a href="http://gawker.com/5045869/michael-phelps-aggressive-grip">ass-grasper</a>, so <a href="http://gawker.com/5100463/cheerio-outrage">we</a> and the rest of the media will continue to<a href="http://gawker.com/5097783/michael-phelps-jared-from-subway-form-goofy-coalition"> tell you exactly</a> what he is <a href="http://gawker.com/5069852/michael-phelps-and-the-nerdy-endorsement-trap">formally recommending</a> for <a href="http://gawker.com/5038764/heroic-phelps-inspires-world-to-gorge-on-mcdonalds">public consumption</a>. Today, the story of how one tiny company swindled the unsophisticated manchild into ongoing indentured servitude:</p> <blockquote><p>Before he earned his eight gold medals and became a global celebrity at the Beijing Olympics, Mr. Phelps and three teammates agreed to endorse PureSport, a protein mix made by a tiny Austin, Texas, company that didn't exist three years ago...</p> <p>The foursome, introduced to the company while training in Austin last year, took a 5% stake in exchange for their endorsements</p></blockquote> <p>So now, in exchange for 1.7% of nothing and all the sugar-and-whey mix he can guzzle, <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged MICHAEL PHELPS" title="Click here to read more posts tagged MICHAEL PHELPS" href="http://gawker.com/tag/michael-phelps/">Michael Phelps</a> is obliged to plaster his face all over this product's packaging, and be dragged around the country to various promo events seven days a year, where hopefully he at least gets mad chicks.

			<title><![CDATA[ Google's austerity campaign ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/googlecover.jpg" width="464" height="604" style="display:block;" />The best place to work in America is becoming like every other big corporation. Google, at its heart an overgrown advertising agency, is most famous for its lavish perks. Now those are disappearing.</p> <p>The billions gushing in from Google's search monopoly don't make for a good story. Whenever Google's PR executives have looked to drum up press, they've led with the candy-colored offices, the free food, and the copious free time. All of those are now on the chopping block &mdash; which leaves not much to talk about at Google except the profits.</p> <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> takes a look at Google's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122826503489174369.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">new push for cost cuts</a>. As <a href="http://valleywag.com/tag/google/food-fight/">others have reported</a>, Google is curtailing service at its cafeterias, reducing hours and restricting guests. A third of Google's 30,000 workers are contractors &mdash; and many of those jobs will disappear. (Conveniently, when a contract ends, it's not deemed a layoff.) And superfluous offices are being shut.</p> <p>More importantly, Google's employees no longer have free rein to pursue their own ideas. Google's engineers can spend 20 percent of time on side projects. That freedom remains, in theory, but the progress a lone engineer can make on a new website without hardware and additional personnel is limited. The new message: Fiddle all you want, but don't expect any money from Google to back your creation.</p> <p>When Google went public in 2004, founders <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged LARRY PAGE" href="http://valleywag.com/tag/larry-page/">Larry Page</a> and <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SERGEY BRIN" href="http://valleywag.com/tag/sergey-brin/">Sergey Brin</a> told shareholders to get ready to be taken for a ride. Not in so many words, of course. But in the company's IPO prospectus, they defended the company's already-lavish perks, and said that investors should expect spending to go up, not down.</p> <p>But Larry and Sergey have grown tired of coddling their employees. Far from being grateful, the perks have made employees feel entitled. Brin in particular has complained about workers taking bowls of M&Ms and free bottled water for granted.</p> <p>Why should Google's founders care, really? They seem increasingly detached from Google's core business, preferring to spend time on rockets and electric sports cars rather than optimizing AdWords. They increasingly deal with a small core of early Google employees, all IPO lottery winners, who are similarly insulated from the economic reality of living in one of the most expensive areas in the U.S.</p> <p>A famous example of their cluelessness: Brin allowed his sister-in-law, <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SUSAN WOJCICKI" href="http://valleywag.com/tag/susan-wojcicki/">Susan Wojcicki</a>, also a Google executive, to <a href="http://valleywag.com/5016355/google-daycare-now-a-luxury-for-larry-and-sergeys-inner-circle">spend millions of Google's money on a new child-care center</a> which dramatically raised its costs. Rather than revise plans to make child-care more affordable, Google <a href="http://valleywag.com/tag/google/kinderplex/">started charging employees nearly twice the market rate</a>.</p> <p>Investors will be unbothered by Larry and Sergey's change of heart. And employees, after they get done grumbling, will likely content themselves with the reality that they still have jobs.</p> <p>No, the people hit hardest by this will be Google's flacks &mdash; and the servile journalists who so eagerly celebrated Google's lava-lamp culture. What stories will they tell now? How Google is cutting corners on the organic foie-gras hamburgers in its cafes?</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Clinton Ineligible For Secretary of State! ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/ron_paul_starting_constitution.gif" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="424" height="477" style="display:block;" />Senator <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HILLARY CLINTON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a> is forbidden from being the nation's Secretary of State&mdash;by <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged THE CONSTITUTION" href="http://gawker.com/tag/the-constitution/">the Constitution</a>! All the hope in the <i>world</i> can't get around that little document, you <i>monster.</i> <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/news/2008/dec/judicial-watch-announces-hillary-clinton-constitutionally-ineligible-serve-secretary-s">Here's the Constitutional bit in question</a>, Article I, Section 6:</p> <blockquote> <p>No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time.</p> </blockquote> <p>"Emoluments" is an old-tymey Constitution word for "scrill." And hey, wouldn't you know, between Clinton's 2006 reelection and now, the salary for Secretary of State went up to $191,300!</p> <p>This has actually, as you might imagine, happened before, lots of times. Usually Congress just passes a bill cutting the salary. But what is different about <i>this</i> nomination, as opposed to the times this has come up in the past? <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/is-clinton-eligible-to-join-the-cabinet/">Crazy obsessive anti-Clinton bloggers!</a></p> <blockquote> <p>“There’s no getting around <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged THE CONSTITUTION" href="http://gawker.com/tag/the-constitution/">the Constitution</a>’s Ineligibility Clause, so <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged HILLARY CLINTON" href="http://gawker.com/tag/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a> is prohibited from serving in the Cabinet until at least 2013, when her current term expires,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. “<a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> should select someone who is eligible for the position of secretary of state and save the country from a constitutional battle over Hillary Clinton’s confirmation.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton flack Philippe Reines' response is pretty choice: "This is a Harvard Law grad nominating a Yale Law grad here, so all parties involved have been cognizant of this issue from the outset." BURN.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ <i>Vogue</i> Intern Disses Celebrity Girlfriend, Gets Suspended ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/avery.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/avery.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" /><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged SEAN AVERY" href="http://gawker.com/tag/sean-avery/">Sean Avery</a> has long relished his role as the National Hockey League's miscreant-in-chief, but the Dallas Stars forward's internship at <em>Vogue</em> seems to have sharpened his instincts for provocation to razor precision. Avery was just suspended indefinitely by the NHL for talking smack about two ex-girlfriends, actress Elisha Cuthbert and model Rachel Hunter, who ended up in the arms of other players. His own team said it would have suspended him had the league not done likewise. The truly insane part of the whole incident is that Avery sought out TV cameras so he could broadcast his self-destructive <a href="http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2008/12/02/Avery_suspended_indefinitely_by_NHL/UPI-27821228269068/">diss.</a> (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Video after the jump.)</p> <blockquote> <p>"I'm really happy to be back in Calgary; I love Canada. I just want to comment on how it's become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my sloppy seconds."<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Cuthbert (pictured below) is <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/H/HKN_STARS_AVERY_SUSPENDED?SITE=FLSTU&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">dating</a> Calgary defenseman Dion Phaneuf, while Hunter ended up with Jarrett Stoll of the Los Angeles Kings.</p> <p><img src="http://gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/75628955.jpg" alt="75628955.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="160" height="222">Avery instinctively understands that the NHL, which is trying to attract new viewers, needs to play up conflict and characters within it own ranks if it wants to draw attention. "Tthe NHL does a terrible job of marketing [by not promoting its] villains," he recently told ESPN. "Nobody cares about Jarome Iginla and guys like that, they're just not exciting enough."</p> <p>Call it the reality television approach to sports &mdash; or, less flatteringly, the professional wrestling approach. Either way, alienating the female half of the potential audience with this "sloppy seconds stunt" doesn't seem like the smartest way to extend the strategy. But then ladies man Avery should know that already!</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ <i>Gossip Girl</i>: The End Of Innocence ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/GossipGirl_Dan_Serena.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/GossipGirl_Dan_Serena.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;" />Nobody died last night! I don't mean in the world, of course people, too many people, died in the world last night. I mean, more importantly, on <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged GOSSIP GIRL" href="http://gawker.com/tag/gossip-girl/">Gossip Girl</a></em>. Two long weeks ago, the "on the next..." clip made it seem like old Barty <strike>Crouch</strike> Bass would be saying hoof to that bucket and bending it like BeckHamm (the super soccer robot made from parts of David and Mia). And maybe he did, far off in the Chekhovian outlands of unseen action, but we didn't get any confirmation one way or another. Just late-breaking word of "the accident." So, ah well, I guess we'll have to wait til next week. For now, other stuff happened! Come read about it with me, won't you?</p> <p>Because <em><a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged GOSSIP GIRL" href="http://gawker.com/tag/gossip-girl/">Gossip Girl</a></em> understands you, Jenny has become the avatar of all the listless young New Yorkians currently out of work. She stays at home in Brooklyn and does manic, weird tasks like arranging records by category, and worries about what the eff she's going to say to her parents. Plus she has an older Mexican orphan come over and steal her boyfriend, just like you! I'm talking of course about Vanessa (I know she's not necessarily Mexican. Comedy!) who had a terrible Nate-shaped (basically like a croissant only floppier) secret in her heart. Remember that she hid his lusty mash note to young Jennifer? Well she did. And now she and Nate are doin' it on the down low and she feels very conflicted. How far all of these morally superior characters have to fall once they've made a small mistake!</p> <p>Then one of the Weird Sister Bitches came over, the Greek princess named Penelope (fitting!), and said "I hate you, make me a dress." Jennifer needed the bones so she said aight and got to sewing a fantastically stupid brackish dress. No matter, because that would soon be tossed to the wind when: young Nathaniel, played semi-convincingly by Twink Android model number #542-fancyfeather (service name: Chace Crawford), is caught by the nefarious Gossip Girl whilst sucking mug with his Dickensian chica. Ohhh the blood did boil when Jenny got her hair helmet in a snitz and saw the photos on her phone box! She needed revenge, nowwww!!!!</p> <p>Like the lovelorn and world weary Odysseus, Jenny was drawn back to Penelope and dashed upon the rocks of her scheming bitchery. "Make her wear this see-through dress," the Weird Sisters (really mixing my metaphors here) hissed. Because, oh yes! What crime! To be seen in ones shapely underoos by a crowd of horny teenage boys! She'll be the laughingstock of awkward late night fumblings! Jenny, scrumple-faced and as unconvincingly motivated as ever, decided to go through with the wicked plan ("Is this a shitty see-through dress which I see before me?").</p> <p>Meanwhile, there was some lumbering nonsense about Serena and her <em>Secret of NIMH</em> boyfriend Aaron. She heard his ex-goilfriend Lexi making apt fun of the stupid Gyro lady photos he'd taken of S. and hung in a gallery. He defended himself dumbly by saying "women have been a focus of art since time immemorial" or some bullshit. That's like saying "bowls of fruit have been a focus of art since blah blah someone push me down a flight of stairs, please." His whole "Brooklyn artist" thing is just... he looks like a rat, OK? He looks a rat and I don't like it. All the while, Lexi was fixing her beady eyes on young Humph, innuendoing that perhaps he should escort her to the big school charity Snowflake Ball.</p> <p>Oh! I forgot to tell you! Because I guess I assumed you would infer it anyway, because every fucking episode of this show must revolve around a party or some kind of dopey event. Well this one was the Snowflake Ball and it involved people dancing and mingling until midnight when Chace Crawford was lowered into the room on a disco ball, dressed as a sex elf named Snowflake. Or something like that.</p> <p>So yeah, Lexi was going with Danno and Serena was grumbly about it and Aaron said "Dan ain't gonna be grumbly about it, that girl puts out on the first date for some weird tangentially feminist reason." Serena was all grossed out by sex so she decided to sex Aaron, after the big dance. Er'body wanted to bone! Including Blair and Chuckles, who continued to circle each other while the ever-quizzical Dorota squirms, stuck in the juicy middle. "You find me a date that I like, and I'll find you a date that you like" was the bet/dare/challenge/yawn of this particular episode and it yielded some funny results when: a) predictably, the dates ended up being into each other and b) Chuck showed up to Chace's big elf debut dressed as a third grader's bedroom ceiling. Seriously. It was like he had glow-in-the-dark stars and moons all over that sparkly jacket of his.</p> <p>Something also happened with Rufus and Lily making goo-talk at each other, but the real dramz was unfolding when V. told N. about stealing the letter and N. was all "evs," but it was too late because she stepped out <strike>across the seal, thus destroying the temple in which the true Grail and the old knight guy are kept, and Elsa fell into a bottomless pit!</strike> into the middle of the room, the spotlight went on, and there, soooo embarrassingly, her perfect figure was revealed. Jessica Szohr did a good job of acting like she'd just pooped herself and N. ran up to Jenny, who looked like Catherine O'Hara in <em>Beetlejuice</em> at this point, and was like "you're so stupid" and then Jenny was all sad and was like "I can't believe I almost had sex with him" and then Chuck was like "you almost had sex with who?" and Jenny was like "Nate" and Chuck was like "bwahahah, your man Nate is a cake boy!" and Jenny was like "what?" and then Blair drove on the freeway and everyone shrieked. Or you know, whatever happened. Nate and Van are smoochily together in the end. Which is good, because she knows she has that Twink Android users manual somewhere at home. Jenny meanwhile made ominous threats to the Weird Sisters that she might be moving to Manhattan so she can compete in the ever-important high school social scene.</p> <p>Then Dan and Serena had a weird awkward conversation about people sticking things into other people and how it made them feel and I don't like watching Penn Badgley try to dance or act lusty or really anything. I wish I could clap my hands or wrinkle my nose or blink my eyes and banish him back to <em>John Tucker Must Die</em> forever. I think things were resolved with them, but who knows??? Because then Lily came rushing up and said "holy fuck, there's been a fucking accident. That old dude's dead or something, holy shit balls what am I gonna tell that shitty kid of his? Ohhh for fuck's sake I hate my fucking life." I think that's verbatim, actually. You can consult the clip above to verify that.</p> <p>So we're left teetering on the brink of something: when do we grieve? And how? Judging by the promo tease, it looks like Chuckles' hair gets long and greasy and there's some srsly big secret about why Lily was in the mental institution. Secret Rufus love child? Hysterical rickets? Schmendrick's disease? (Please someone get that last reference, I will give you money.*)</p> <p>I guess we'll have to wait to find out next week! Oh it's all so exciting! And all so fleeting. Everyone's dying and lying and having sex now. I remember these jokers when they wuz but kids. It happens so fast. It happens too fast.</p> <p><em>*Not really.</em></p> <p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-JpJjsHgYHA&hl=en&fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-JpJjsHgYHA&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></object></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Calling Bullshit On The Obama Ring Story ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/12/obamas2.jpeg" width="287" height="297" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>President-elect Obama&mdash;allegedly a 'man of the people'&mdash;is allegedly buying a fancy $30,000 ring for his fancy wife, allegedly! It was <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1090653/Barack-Obama-buy-rare-20-000-rhodium-ring-wife-say-thanks-support.html">in the trusty<em> Daily Mail</em></a>, and now it's the top story on Drudge, meaning it is the single most important news story in all the world. Elitist Obama drops 30K on bling for his wife during a recession&mdash;and this bling will be made out of rhodium, the world's most expensive metal! This story is almost certainly bullshit, and we will tell you exactly why. [Updates below&mdash;we were right]:</p> <p><strong>1. The setup&mdash;</strong>Say, for argument's sake, that Obama <em>did</em> order an expensive, custom-made ring to thank his wife for her help in the campaign. Would the chosen designer of that ring run out and immediately tell the press all about it? Not just the press, but the <em>Daily Mail</em>, a sleazeball London tabloid? No, because that designer would subsequently be destroyed by <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>, the president of the US.<br /> <strong><br /> 2. The story itself&mdash;</strong>What's the sourcing for this big story? Did Obama sheepishly acknowledge his gift with a smile once it broke? No. The sole source is a "spokesman" for the "designer" of the ring. Who also gave this ridonkulous quote:</p> <blockquote><p> 'For obvious privacy reasons I cannot reveal the cost of the ring but bearing in mind it is made from rhodium or black gold and encrusted with diamonds you can be sure it will cost thousands of pounds.'</p></blockquote> <p>Mmm hmm. Classy. It's also painfully clear that the story is filled out by fun facts about rhodium pulled off some press release. Did you know that "rhodium was chosen as the material for the disc presented to Beatle Paul McCartney for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist"? <a class="autolink" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" title="Click here to read more posts tagged BARACK OBAMA" href="http://gawker.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> obviously did, which is why he insisted on ordering this here ring!</p> <p><strong>3. The designer&mdash;</strong>Supposedly Obama has ordered this ring to be specially made by Giovanni Bosco, an "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hit-and-run/hit--run-ring-the-changes-1044166.html">A-list</a>" Italian designer. Really? If he's so A-list, why has his name never&mdash;never!&mdash;appeared in Nexis, the database of all things media? If he's so A-list, why does<a href="http://www.boscogioielli.it/apri_doc.asp?doc=1895"> his website</a> look so D-list? And why does the <a href="http://www.boscogioielli.it/pictures/press_/index.html">"Press" section</a> seem to be full mostly of his own ads? Decidedly non-Presidential. </p> <p>So the worldwide media has bitten big-time on a story that was almost certainly planted by this jewelry designer himself, or a very enterprising flack. And everybody wins ("everybody" meaning "Right wing media outlets" and "Giovanni Bosco")! Good show, Giovanni Bosco. Thanks to all this press you will probably be able to sell some rings that are real. [Pic <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/perry032/impossible/Obamas%20dap2.jpg">via</a>]</p> <p>[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1208/Obama_aide_denies_ring_story.html">And the Obama camp just denied it</a>.]</p> <p>[UPDATE 2, via Politico:<a href="http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2008/12/02/barack-obama-not-buying-michelle-obama-30k-ring/"> Tommy Christopher at AOL got a head-scratching statement </a>from the spokesman for the jeweler in question, who also denies the story as reported:</p> <blockquote><p>I regret to inform you that because of reports so wrong and clearly different from the reality of our statements, we decided to not issue statement on this matter.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we were negatively affected by read on national and foreign media news stories that have no basement[sic], and in excess of the objective reality.</p> <p>I inform you that we have no intention to disseminate more information about this story. </p></blockquote> ]]></description>
