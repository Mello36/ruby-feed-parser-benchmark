It was an important band from my early 20s and I allways missed them. They are pretty historical band in fact, but you would never guess it from their attitude, I really like that about them, the antithesis of the star attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Barlow"&gt;Lou Barlow&lt;/a&gt; (was in Dinosaur Jr, then founded Sebadoh, also Folk Implosion, also follow his solo carrer) is credited for having invented the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music"&gt;lo-fi&lt;/a&gt; style (meaning more authentic, not over produced, sometimes meaning home recorded). The 3 of them all sing ther own composition, switch instruments and just stay true to what they started as: experimentation, freedom and chaos even if it means aking us wait 5 minutes in between songs because they are switching places and gears. In short, &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=u78BXs5tsOo"&gt;very very cool show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other very good suprises from that show were &lt;a href="http://www.loveofdiagrams.com/"&gt;Love of Diagrams&lt;/a&gt;, a two girls one guy band from Australia with an interesting punky Nu Wavy sound,  and &lt;a href="http://www.thebentmoustache.com/"&gt;Bent Moustach&lt;/a&gt;, a Dutch band (i have a sweet spot for anything Dutch having lived 4 years there) with a very funny energy, mixing shoegaze and Dub. Very very nice live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more on these bands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sebadoh.com/mp3/mp3.html"&gt;Sebadoh MP3s &lt;/a&gt;- they are asking for bootleg on their websites :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QGiwgKXRm7I&amp;mode=related&amp;amp;search="&gt;Sebadoh video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shootthevariable.com/loveofdiagrams/nowayout.mov"&gt;Video of Love of Diagrams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebentmoustacheband"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Bent Moustach on My Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2007/03/sebadoh-at-noise-pop-2007.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-116288380285744524</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2006 07:16:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-01-02T14:43:12.006-08:00</atom:updated><title>CSS (Cansei De Ser Sexy)</title><description>&lt;b&gt;Cansei de Ser Sexy - Alala&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/apB7V4PIeLI"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://youtube.com/v/apB7V4PIeLI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest discovery: CSS.&lt;br /&gt;Do you know this band? Really fun, not taking themselves seriously at all 5 girls and a guy, self-proclaimed, self-taught musicians and singers but that got signed by Sup-Pop nonetheless, pretty amazing! They are from Brazil but you would not guess it, their sound is more European Electro-rock-trash. They don't sing in Brazilian but in English because as they proclaim it: their scene is the Internet. So you find them all over the net, they have their own "TV channel" on You Tube: CSS.tv.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that I could not find their music digitally elsewhere than iTunes (well ok they are not on eMusic, the MP3 site I use, so I bought them DRMized, damm!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here is a video of them, enjoy!</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/11/css-cansei-de-ser-sexy_06.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-116288206582963407</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2006 06:36:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-11-06T22:52:18.820-08:00</atom:updated><title>Green Festival this WE</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.sjaaks.com/logo.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://www.sjaaks.com/logo.gif" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this is a busy week in San Francisco for the techies...there is of course the one and only &lt;a href="http://www.web2con.com/"&gt;web 2.0 conference&lt;/a&gt;. We also just finished the very good first ever on that subject &lt;a href="http://widgetslive.com/"&gt;Widget Live conference&lt;/a&gt; organized by &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/"&gt;Om&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/"&gt;Niall&lt;/a&gt;, there will be &lt;a href="http://www.web2point2.org/"&gt;web2point2&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the week....but in a very different category, I wanted to point out an expo not to miss this WE: the &lt;a href="http://www.greenfestivals.org/content/view/7/29/"&gt;Green Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I volunteered to the first ever &lt;a href="http://www.greenfestivals.org/content/view/7/29/"&gt;Green Festival&lt;/a&gt; 4 years ago (geez, time flies) and loved the vibe and energy from this conference. There is such a vibrant community and ecosystem in that field and so much innovations in there too. This year, I will be attending again but this time selling/promoting organic chocolates :-) for a small traditional chocolate company that started an organic line couple of years ago: &lt;a href="http://www.sjaaks.com/"&gt;Sjaaks Organics Chocolates&lt;/a&gt;. This should be fun, so if you're in the neighborhood, you should check it out....</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/11/green-festival-this-we.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-115834223863889797</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2006 17:32:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-01-02T14:48:08.976-08:00</atom:updated><title>Fresh song to put smile on your face</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.lilyallenmusic.com/ms/imagerepository/galleryimagespublic/1615997-2"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;

So I moved some of my tracks back to private and left what I thought would be "socially more acceptable"&lt;br /&gt;- me showing to my boss Mercora and Last.fm and him fixating on: what is it that you're listening to? The new Pornographers? What is that? It is just an inoffensive pop band but going through the length of explaining it to my boss is something I could have lived without.&lt;br /&gt;- my old manager saying "so had some fun last WE?" after I uploaded a bunch of pictures on Flickr of me and a co-worker celebrating at a very fun party where in some of them we may have looked a little tipsy...there again I moved these pics to "friends only", not that Sean, my old boss, cared at all but more because again of what image did I want to portray to my work sphere, as well as because of the fact that it was not just about me but about my co-worker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess there is what I am okay with portraying and there it is fine that my "attention data" are used and displayed because I find value in it... and then there are these embarassments or "not always socially acceptable" moments that I would prefer and should be able to keep to myself or a chosen inner social circle or even a trusted service provider. And I would love to have control over that.&lt;br /&gt;Which is why an organization like &lt;a href="http://www.attentiontrust.org/"&gt;Attention Trust&lt;/a&gt; is so important and why the ability to control who sees what will be a highly demanded service in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, excellent post from Danah with some serious food for thought</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/06/about-privacy.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-115000321257009288</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2006 05:02:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-06-10T22:22:23.930-07:00</atom:updated><title>Pikeo is on</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://pikeo.com/bitmaps/pikeobetalogo_120x60.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://pikeo.com/bitmaps/pikeobetalogo_120x60.gif" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a nice project from our center just went live.

Too bad, I am subscribing to great content like ITC, but I end-up very rarely listening to them. &lt;br /&gt;I wonder how true is it for other people as well, when you know that today most people listen to their podcasts on their computers. I don't take the time to synch them to my iPod. I guess this will change when podcasting-to-the mobile will become more mainstream, as then we will not need to synch anymore and then when I will have some time to kill or will be working out, I would have all of my great podcasts imediately available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, here are some music podcasts I would recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://cognacjay.blogspot.com/"&gt;Cognac Jay&lt;/a&gt;, podcast from a friend from France with some really good eclectic music,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.subpop.com/syndicate/"&gt;Sub Pop&lt;/a&gt;, each week this great label podcast songs of its artists for download, very cool initiative,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anticon.com/"&gt;Anticon&lt;/a&gt;, label that I love from Oakland, has some really cool podcast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;, show from NPR with a very different mix of artists at each time.</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/05/podcasts-i-listen-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-114844801813512023</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2006 05:08:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-05-23T22:34:40.233-07:00</atom:updated><title>Grand Canyon</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2952/622/1600/DSC01497.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2952/622/320/DSC01497.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my week at Las Vegas for the CTIA show, I did a small roadtrip with Troy to Grand Canyon. It was actually nice to escape the craziness and business of Las Vegas for the desertic roads. Grand Canyon, sorry for the lack of originality but really, was gigantic. I loved it. It was so different from any other landscape I experienced and so big, this huge hole that goes on for miles and miles, just the result of erosion, amazing!&lt;br /&gt;We experienced a stunning sunset, definitely in my top ones ever, at Desert View.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely regret we did not take more time to explore the Grand Canyon, so wished we could have take a day hike to Colorado River. I so would have liked to see the other canyons too. Well, next time...damm this country is so big and so much to see!</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/05/grand-canyon.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-114810640607966646</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2006 06:16:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-05-25T07:15:17.130-07:00</atom:updated><title>Entre les deux</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000BPR6DI.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000BPR6DI.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000AHMRB8.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000AHMRB8.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mon coeur balance....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hesitating between these 2 phones for my next little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Both looks cute (very important factor for me), both do what I want in terms of multimedia (pics, video, music), both looks pretty small.

I also I really cherish my subscriptions to &lt;a href="http://www.emusic.com/promo/new25free/index.html?fref=700006&amp;refsrc=google"&gt;E-music&lt;/a&gt;. It's pure MP3, no dirty DRM associated. However, it's more of a download type of place, the social features are not there, and although their catalogue is good, they don't have everything. Actually, I was pleasently surprised to see that some of the small artists I discovered here in the Bay are on Yahoo! Music...The beauty of the digital world. &lt;br /&gt;MySpace Music is so prominent in terms of artists represented, it would be cool to integrate it witin a music service... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- today, the weather is bad, so I am staying in reading "This is Burning Man"</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/03/what-ive-been-up-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-114056823098521339</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2006 00:27:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-02-23T22:39:21.683-08:00</atom:updated><title>like this quotation</title><description>from &lt;a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1894895,00.asp"&gt;Jim Rapoza, Columnist, e-week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Isn't saying that performing searches is one of the main reasons people use the Internet kind of like saying that riding in taxis is one of the main reasons people go to New York City?"</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/02/like-this-quotation.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-114011707338503260</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2006 19:03:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-02-17T12:13:13.640-08:00</atom:updated><title>Podbop: I dreamed it, they made it</title><description>I have been wanting something like this for a long time now.

He mentions these points as being hi summary of Umair Haque’s theory of media economics.&lt;br /&gt;To sum-up the most important points for me:&lt;br /&gt;"When there were only a handful of content choices, there was plenty of attention to go around — and attention could be bought through marketing.&lt;br /&gt;When there were only a handful of distribution channels, and the cost of entry was high, a handful of players could profitably compete for a slice of the attention pie.&lt;br /&gt;Digital and network technology has lead to an explosion of content and distribution channels, i.e. a proliferation of media.&lt;br /&gt;The proliferation of media is destoying the economics of Old Media, which depended on a finite media universe.&lt;br /&gt;The proliferation of media is a bubble because it’s being driven by speculation — the 20 million bloggers and dozens of Web 2.0 sites popping up everyday are speculating on the unbundling of content and distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;As a result of the speculation in media, there is now too much media competing for too little attention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the cognitive dissonance of too much media choice becomes too great, individual media behavior, i.e. the allocation of attention, will become chaotic and haphazard. When this happens (and it already has), no one is going to be able to build a profitable business model because the two types of media dollars — advertising and content fees — won’t be able to flow efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;What the user needs is help allocating a finite amount of attention. And the solution needs to be personal — perfectly tailored to each user’s needs. The user needs a personal killer app."</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/02/bubble-20-is-bubble-in-media.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8866130.post-113894587288815583</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2006 05:27:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-02-13T19:46:16.383-08:00</atom:updated><title>Do you know The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble?</title><description>&lt;a href="http://myspace-405.vo.llnwd.net/00200/50/44/200184405_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px;" src="http://myspace-405.vo.llnwd.net/00200/50/44/200184405_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble? &lt;br /&gt;They are my latest discovery on MySpace. &lt;br /&gt;I guess a lot of people use MySpce to hook-up. I use it to catch up with my friends and to discover new music. Every small bands imaginable is on there. So my latest discovery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tkde.net/"&gt;The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;.  From their website "The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble’s form of mutant jazz, slithers and slides...delicately painful. Each song, a little story of heartache, hope and perseverance, seemlessly fusing analogue and digital. Soundtracks to non-existing movies, inspired by the worlds of The Quay Brothers, Hieronymus Bosch, Picasso, Goya, Murnau and Lang." &lt;br /&gt;I don't even like jazz usually (but is it Jazz?), but their sound touches me, very melancolic and beautiful. &lt;br /&gt;They will be on &lt;a href="http://www.planet-mu.com/"&gt;Planet-Mu&lt;/a&gt;, home to some very very good electronic artists (&lt;a href="http://www.venetiansnares.com"&gt;Venetian Snares&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.addictrecords.com"&gt;Doormouse&lt;/a&gt;, two of my favorites)</description><link>http://virginied.blogspot.com/2006/02/do-you-know-kilimanjaro-darkjazz.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Virginie)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
