Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But an interesting trend I am seeing is how companies are procurring the software and services needed to deliver rich predictive analytics. Let's start with a description of the traditional model (see chart bottom):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vM3AI2_ha70/STkINu88cxI/AAAAAAAAAAc/osWf21TueVw/s1600-h/web+2.0.png"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276257470476219154" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 296px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vM3AI2_ha70/STkINu88cxI/AAAAAAAAAAc/osWf21TueVw/s400/web+2.0.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Companies make major investments in "enterprise" platforms (ERP, CRM, BI) to automate core business processes like finance, supply chain, marketing, sales processes etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. These major SW platforms are LOADED with lotsa feature/functionality in order to make the platform applicable to any company BUT most companies get 80% of the value from only 20% of the features that apply to their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. But, by themselves these enterprise packages provide little business insight -- they just automate processes and collect data. Rather, most companies hire an internal staff of platform experts (e.g. SAP or Siebel experts) or external consultants to do analysis, insight and improve process management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so that's whats happened so far. But now companies are realizing that: a) automation is not enough, b) more insight and analytics is needed, and most importantly c) there are key, &lt;strong&gt;highly specialized, important business processes unique to each company&lt;/strong&gt; that are not be easily automated by enterprise systems and for which they need &lt;strong&gt;unique, highly specialized data and analytics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some examples? Here are a few: the pricing process, price discovery, behavior based customer segmentaion and targeting, channel marketing programs, and solution configuration and customization. There are important, specialized business processes in every company that need: 1) some level of automation, 2) systematic data collection, and 3) intelligent data analytics to improve/modify strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These specializded business processes are not amenable to "buying a software package" and then "hiring an expert". They need to be customized to each company's unique products and strategy and they need to produce data and insight unique to the needs of management. As powerful Web 2.0 tools emerge, we are seeing the emergence of is "tailored Web 2.0 solutions" -- a combination of customizable web-based BPM process automation platforms, systematic pro-active data collection, and then on-going analytics of process performance, and customer preferences. &lt;strong&gt;These are integrated solutions that combine sofware and services &lt;/strong&gt;(see chart top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound complex? Not really -- its already happening. In my next post I will describe some examples....</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/3434765485560875189/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=3434765485560875189' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/3434765485560875189?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3434765485560875189'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/12/how-web-20-will-change-analytics.html' title='How Web 2.0 will Change Analytics -- Part 1'/><author><name>Tim Furey</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15009325692853204131</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vM3AI2_ha70/STkINu88cxI/AAAAAAAAAAc/osWf21TueVw/s72-c/web+2.0.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-4643471602978661814</id><published>2008-12-04T20:51:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-05T14:32:54.200-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-12-05T14:32:54.200-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ROMI'/><title type='text'>ROMI White Paper</title><content type='html'>By Andy Hasselwander&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few months I've worked with a colleague of mine, Alex Aldag, who used to be at Channel Economics and is now a Principal in the analytics group at MB, to write a pretty interesting white paper on the challenges of measuring ROMI in a B2B environment. There's some good data we've gathered from a bunch of industries in there. You can reach it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/Forms2/ROMI_Executive_Brief.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; after registering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Outtakes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Return on ROMI: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Given increasing financial pressures, it is likely that senior executives will continue to be more and more critical of corporate spending. Marketing budgets are frequently perceived to be more discretionary and less directly tied to firm performance. As marketing mix shifts, it will be increasingly critical to adapt measurement and reporting practices to account for new stimuli put into market. Nearly 80% of firms that employ ROMI measurement today assess their marketing performance as somewhat to highly effective, compared to only 42% of firms that do not measure ROMI."

But, given all the recent depression buzz (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Return-Depression-Economics-Paul-Krugman/dp/0393320367"&gt;Krugman's book&lt;/a&gt;, non-stop CNBC pundits who won't shut up about crashes and black Mondays and Fridays,) I pulled &lt;a href="http://www.studsterkel.org/"&gt;Studs Terkel's&lt;/a&gt; fantastic &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Times-History-Great-Depression/dp/1565846567"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hard Times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;down off the shelf the other night.  There's a section in there called &lt;strong&gt;"The Big Money" &lt;/strong&gt;where he interviews people that actually did well during the Depression.  Here are some outtakes from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Burnett_Benton"&gt;William Benton's&lt;/a&gt; interview:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#6633ff;"&gt;"I left Chicago in June of '29, just a few months before the Crash.  Chester Bowles and I started in business with seventeen hundred square feet, just the two of us and a couple of girls.  July 15, 1929--this was the very day of the all-time peak on the stock market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#6633ff;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#6633ff;"&gt;As I solicited business, my chart was kind of a cross.  The left-hand line started at the top corner and ended in the bottom right corner.  That was the stock market index.  The other line was Benton &amp;amp; Bowles.  It started at the bottom left-hand corner and ended in the top right-hand corner.  A cross... When I sold the agency in 1935, it was the single biggest office in the world.  And the most profitable office."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#6633ff;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;"&gt;Well, this is an interesting case study, I thought.  Maybe I should pay attention.  The most amazing thing about &lt;strong&gt;Hard Times&lt;/strong&gt; is how familiar it seems.  The passages talking about bubbles, business cycles, people's incredulity at how all this happened is really eerie.  So how did Benton &amp;amp; Bowles kick butt in the depression?  Here are some best practices:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They essentially invented audience research.&lt;/strong&gt;  When they heard a lot of people listening to "Amos and Andy" on the radio, they bought it straight away.  They put a Pepsodent spot on and sales went through the roof.  They worked with George Gallup.  They listened to customers.  This was new stuff.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cc0000;"&gt;Lesson: Marketers who listen to their customers in new and powerful ways will win the battle for fewer dollars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radio was the newest&lt;strong&gt; new media&lt;/strong&gt; at the time.  Basically, they were investing like crazy into stuff that the big agencies didn't understand yet.  They were young--late 20s--and didn't know any better.  &lt;span style="color:#cc0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson: Those who master the next wave of media will rise above the fray.  Mobile?  Social?  Something we haven't seen yet??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once into radio, they perfected "audio illusion".  Example--they cast two people in one role on "Showboat", a program to promote Maxwell House Coffee.  A sexy singer for the audio, and a known actress for the voice.  They also started adding in sound clips of the coffee brewing and pouring.  Sales doubled and quadrupled, crushing store brands.  &lt;strong&gt;The other agencies were angry because it was improper to do these things at the time. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cc0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson: Just because things are done one way, don't fear doing it a totally different way.  Thinking outside the box is critical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once this guy had a lot of money, he was able to &lt;strong&gt;buy businesses at bargain basement prices.&lt;/strong&gt;  He bought Muzak for next to nothing and built it into a national behemoth.  &lt;span style="color:#cc0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson: Keep some powder dry.  The really good investment opportunities are starting now.  Once you buy, own and retool.  Pretty good time to be a PE company, even if Carlyle is laying off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He also comments on how he was able to &lt;strong&gt;add incredible talent at low prices&lt;/strong&gt; because of the glut of labor supply.  His salesmen improved every year as they could screen more and more applicants for these jobs.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cc0000;"&gt;Lesson: Keep hiring channels open and be pickier than ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;For anyone who hasn't read Hard Times or any of the Studs Terkel interview compilations, they are an incredible insight into people's attitudes and behaviors throughout history.  I highly recommend them.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/3960791196827529449/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=3960791196827529449' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/3960791196827529449?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3960791196827529449'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/12/depression-marketing-best-practices.html' title='Depression Marketing Best Practices'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-929126087580905814</id><published>2008-11-22T17:29:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-22T18:27:59.847-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-22T18:27:59.847-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='attitudes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='AMA'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing mix optimization'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ROMI'/><title type='text'>Using Customer Equity as a Dependent Variable for MarComm Optimization</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SSiOQl-q-7I/AAAAAAAAADQ/h65pDb0Herc/s1600-h/Return_on_Customer_Equity.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271619779561192370" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 286px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SSiOQl-q-7I/AAAAAAAAADQ/h65pDb0Herc/s400/Return_on_Customer_Equity.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've written a lot about &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/search/label/marketing%20mix%20optimization"&gt;marketing optimization, ROMI, and mix optimization&lt;/a&gt;. In past posts, the dependent variables--the "things to optimize"--have been defined as time series variables of aggregated data. Some examples--"sales", "profits", "awareness." These would be entered into a model on a weekly or monthly basis, and then once a company has 70 or 100 of these data points, it can start building regression models to understand the effect of stimulus on response.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are a lot of problems with this approach, particularly when trying to understand short- vs. long-term effects. A short term effect would be the impact of a demand gen campaign on sales. This would happen fairly quickly. A long-term effect would be attitudinal. As customers' perceptions of brand quality change, for example, this has a long-lasting effect that must be taken into account over many years. Decisions to spend money to affect perceptions of quality, though, must somehow be balanced next to decisions on how to spend money that will get customers in the door tomorrow. It's tough work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml, in their 2004 Journal of Marketing Article &lt;a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/ResourceLibrary/JournalofMarketing/Pages/2004/68/1/11924951.aspx"&gt;"Return on Marketing: Using Customer Equity to Focus Marketing Strategy"&lt;/a&gt; have a neat solution.  It's to make the dependent variable the customer.  In other words, when making marketing investment decisions, companies should understand how each investment impact core "orthogonal perceptions" for each of its customer segments, and then trace the impact of these perceptions on customer behavior in the form of acquisition and retention.  They suggest thinking of each customer relationship as a string of future actions--either they will or won't buy, at different amounts, through time.  They do this using a mathematical technique called a Markov Chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;So the approach that others recommend and I think can work really well for B2B marketers is to change the dependent variable from an aggregation to the atomic customers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The nice thing about going &lt;strong&gt;investment--&gt;perception--&gt;customer behavior--&gt;customer equity &lt;/strong&gt;is that you have almost unlimited scenario flexibility.  Because the atomic level data is at the customer level, you can change assumptions about segmentation easily and see the impact on ROMI.  There are, however, a couple of key challenges:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do we understand the &lt;strong&gt;impact of marketing investments on perceptions&lt;/strong&gt;?  The marketer still needs to do research, in the form of recognition tracking through time, to understand this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do we understand &lt;strong&gt;which core attitudes are truly important&lt;/strong&gt;?  Market research needs to be done, in the form of qualitative followed by quantitative research, to understand the constructs that truly drive acquisition and retention behavior.  In the article, the authors tested questions on &lt;strong&gt;inertia, quality, price, convenience, ad awareness, information, corporate citizenship, community events, ethical standards, etc totally 17 questions.  &lt;/strong&gt;They used PCA (Principle Components Analysis) to whittle this list down to 11 constructs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer segmentation.&lt;/strong&gt;  Not all customers act the same way, and the more discrimination we are able to build into our model, the better.  Ideally, we'd like a &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/search/label/Segmentation"&gt;unified segmentation&lt;/a&gt; to drive our research here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True short-term goals.&lt;/strong&gt;  While this approach can theoretically handle all marketing activities, it doesn't describe how to handle true short-term actions.  However, I think it's pretty easy to bolt this on.  Because we're looking at customers as the dependent variable, we'd simply add on known short-term acquisition and retention levers to only impact the first step of the Markov Chain.  If an email acquisition program drove 5% of a segment to but, we'd simply add 5% onto the first Markov chain probability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more detail to this, but it should give a taste to the marketer who's interested in using customer equity as a dependent variable for ROMI / mix modeling.

I've been thinking lately that LinkedIn could become the best source of B2B Marketing data in the world.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's international.  People sign up all over Western Europe and North America and increasingly in Asian hubs like Singapore and Shanghai.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People add all kinds of information on themselves that can be increasingly accessed by text mining tools like &lt;a href="http://www.spss.com/clementine/"&gt;SPSS Clementine&lt;/a&gt; (which is what they used for the AdAge piece.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn is increasingly adding meta data to profiles making the datawarehouse much more useful for modeling.  The best example of this is the voluntary "alumni" and "company" networks which are self-policing.  On the basis of personal experience, the self policing works at least somewhat well.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can easily see a LinkedIn being purchased by a &lt;a href="http://www.dnb.com/us/"&gt;D&amp;amp;B&lt;/a&gt; (or, if they wait long enough, for the opposite to happen) because it will very quickly outstrip D&amp;amp;B as a data source.  The biggest hurdle I see is the legal one--I'm not sure how far LinkedIn can go as a data provider without changing their privacy contracts.  However, they could do this with a little effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also see LinkedIn as a much more powerful tool in the long run over a FaceBook.  This might sound crazy, but it's because I'm not talking about display advertising.  It's using the network as a data source.  Companies would pay tons of money for an accurate SMB / Enterprise data source that included &lt;strong&gt;actual personal relationships inside the company&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;relationships with people outside the company.  &lt;/strong&gt;Talk about CRM--this takes the B2B &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/11/b2b-crm-branding-model.html"&gt;CRM approach I spoke about yesterday&lt;/a&gt; and really operationalizes it.  Combine it with a D&amp;amp;B or &lt;a href="http://www.infousa.com/"&gt;InfoUSA&lt;/a&gt; and you've got a relationship marketing machine category killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The segments that the AdAge work uncovered were interesting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First over 30 million people are signed up.  Just doing some simple math, if there are 150 M in the "professional class" worldwide, that's 20% penetration.  Pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First segment they ID'd was &lt;strong&gt;Senior Executives &lt;/strong&gt;at 28% of population.  Average income was $104,000--the highest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late Adopters, &lt;/strong&gt;at 22% of the population, have low network power and were basically asked by colleagues to join.  They don't actively tend their networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savvy Networkers, &lt;/strong&gt;at 30% of the population, actively tend their networks and have high network influence.  They tend to be actively out there sourcing  business, recruiting, looking for jobs, etc.  They are dynamic and are the biggest "users" of the network.  I expect there are a lot of entrepreneurs in here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring Options, &lt;/strong&gt;at 20% of the population, are sort of the middle-of-the-pack folks who are generally happily employed but looking around.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple segmentation and not all that useful but it gives you some insight into what someone could do with these data.  The text mining was especially interesting.  They were able to identify and quantify decision makers, decision makers' budgets, salaries at different title levels, etc.  They also noted that 60% of users said they'd take a survey in their area of expertise.  Think about being able to identify the entire decision making unit (DMU) inside of an SMB and multiply that be 1000.  It's mind boggling.  I'm waiting for the partnerships on LinkedIn and the real monetization to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, think about linking this into a collaborative partner marketing system.  Microsoft provides LinkedIn matching data to its resellers in exchange for end user data... Yikes.  Probably merits a whole other post or an article.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/7379938479822979398/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=7379938479822979398' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/7379938479822979398?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7379938479822979398'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/11/linkedin-as-data-source.html' title='LinkedIn as a Data Source'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-1491983501187282416</id><published>2008-11-12T15:35:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-12T16:49:03.968-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-12T16:49:03.968-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Decision Makers'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='attitudes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Influencers'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Brand'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CRM'/><title type='text'>B2B CRM / Branding Model</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SRtPK_0URqI/AAAAAAAAACw/maDKyLRmg3w/s1600-h/CRMbrandingB2B.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267891239488079522" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 327px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SRtPK_0URqI/AAAAAAAAACw/maDKyLRmg3w/s400/CRMbrandingB2B.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was doing some more thinking about a specific B2B CRM and branding model. This relates to a &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/11/disconnect-between-crm-definitions.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; on CRM. I was thinking about how you build an interaction model between the firm and its customers if those customers are businesses. I was also thinking about the function of "branding"--creating consistent communications across all customer touchpoints. A more holistic definition of branding might include all customer interactions, period, including services, products, even non-company-sponsored interactions such as through "key influencers."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The concept, while not earth-shattering, does provide some clarity to the role of branding and CRM in a B2B organization. It also leverages some of the concepts that I've been thinking more about lately, namely the core function of inbound marketing or listening and the imperative of thinking of the company-customer as a &lt;strong&gt;decision making unit &lt;/strong&gt;and not just as a monolith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basically the framework divides up the CRM value chain into four parts. Let's stat with &lt;strong&gt;Marketing Management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This is the company function, and it is the marketing nerve center where all core decisions are made about the customers and the &lt;strong&gt;brand&lt;/strong&gt;. The functions of marketing management involve product features, packaging, and value proposition; service elements, including all of the myriad post-sale touchpoints with customers; the marketing mix; and of course, segmentation, targeting and positioning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The marketing management function's decisions are manifested in the &lt;strong&gt;outbound marketing function.&lt;/strong&gt; Using a person as an analogy, this function amounts to "talking." The outbound function should entail communications (TV, radio, email, sales force, partners, etc.); experiences (product experiences; service experiences) and influentials (all of the sources that people listen to--the media, influential bloggers, influential user groups.) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The target of the outbound marketing are the &lt;strong&gt;business customers.&lt;/strong&gt; These &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be deconstructed from the &lt;strong&gt;firm&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;decision making unit&lt;/strong&gt; inside the firm to the &lt;strong&gt;individuals inside the decision making unit. &lt;/strong&gt;Furthermore, individuals must be understood at the level of both &lt;strong&gt;behavior--what they do &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;attitudes and perceptions about the company and its products--which is of course THE BRAND. &lt;/strong&gt;I can't emphasize enough how important it is to think of the B2B brand as the collective set of attitudes and perceptions latent in the individuals inside the decision making units at your firm's customers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally, the fourth box is the &lt;strong&gt;inbound "listening"&lt;/strong&gt; activity where your customers talk back to you. There are five primary elements of listening: &lt;strong&gt;sampling (tracking studies); chatter (web or otherwise); engagement (two-way conversations); purchase (buying); and loyalty (staying a customer). &lt;/strong&gt;Generally, these five inbound vehicles paint a holistic view of the health of your company within a company, a DMU and key individuals inside the company.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I like this model because it brings together the core functions of both branding and CRM in a B2B context and provides a framework upon which to hang more complex ideas. It doesn't deal at all with technology (which is key to enabling both the outbound and inbound functions). It doesn't deal with any of the "technical" aspects of marketing, like PR, media mix optimization, etc., but it does allow slots for all of these things. Partner marketing could easily slot in to outbound and inbound, or you could actually build two business customer boxes for partners and end customers. In short, it's just a very versatile framework.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/1491983501187282416/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=1491983501187282416' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/1491983501187282416?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1491983501187282416'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/11/b2b-crm-branding-model.html' title='B2B CRM / Branding Model'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SRtPK_0URqI/AAAAAAAAACw/maDKyLRmg3w/s72-c/CRMbrandingB2B.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-9197888121380428031</id><published>2008-11-07T16:44:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-07T16:52:49.398-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-07T16:52:49.398-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pipeline'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='data mining'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lead Management'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Recession'/><title type='text'>MarketingSherpa Article--Boosting Lead Scores in a Downturn</title><content type='html'>In a &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/lead-qualification-in-new-bad-economy.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I had mentioned that MarketingSherpa had interviewed me on lead qualification in a downturn.

The one used by 95% of practioners goes something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"CRM is the systems and tools to integrate customer and marketing stimulus data together to provide useable information for marketers and managers."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The academic version is a lot more complicated. It includes the above technology, but CRM in academia is a whole branch of research. It seems a bit like an unholy alliance between the people doing the analytical marketing and the people thinking about it. Speaking of unholy alliances, there is an academic department dedicated to CRM at Duke University--&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.teradataduke.org/ApplicationFiles/web/WebFrame.cfm?web_id=26"&gt;The Teradata Center for Customer Relationship Management at Duke University (Fuqua&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; Three years ago, this group put out a special addendum in the &lt;a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/"&gt;Journal of Marketing &lt;/a&gt;on CRM. I read it when it came out, but I just re-read the introduction. In this 20 page pre-read to a bunch of CRM research, which mainly focuses on ROI studies around CRM, they acknowledge the definitional difficulties around CRM. They acknowledge that the concept of CRM has lost some of its meaning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"...on the basis of our preceding discussion, it could be argued that CRM is the relabeling of a mixture of different marketing ideas in the extant marketing literature..."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Boulding, Staelin, Ehret and Johnston, "A Customer Relationship Management Roadmap: What is Known, Potential Pitfalls, and Where to Go., Journal of Marketing, October 2005)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The preceding discussion they refer to outlines a bunch of really important topics in marketing that CRM supposedly encompasses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Value maximization--firms and customers maximize utility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need fulfillment (Levitt 1960)--marketers need to sell needs not products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Augmented product (Levitt 1969)--customers buy products as solutions / buying experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relationship marketing (Berry 1983)--the ongoing relationship, not just the transaction, is the critical marketing focus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market orientation; market focus; market-based learning--information about the customer / market is the key to successful marketing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;One-to-one marketing (Peppers and Rogers 1993)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mass customization (Pine 1993)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where they end up is defining CRM as something building on the above seven concepts &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; incorporating technology, but definitely not as just "Siebel / Oracle" or "Salesforce.com" Instead they define a bunch propositions, acknowledging that "The field of CRM has begun to converge on a common definition." I have separated these into four "definitional" propositions and another six "success factor" propositions. They didn't do this, but I think it's much clearer this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitional Propositions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CRM is the outcome of the continuing evolution and integration of marketing ideas and newly available data, technologies and organizational forms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;CRM enhances firm performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective CRM implementation &lt;strong&gt;does not necessarily&lt;/strong&gt; require sophisticated analysis, concepts, or technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;core of CRM is the concept of dual creation of value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success factors basically list what it takes for CRM to work. I think this is a pretty good list by itself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Factors or Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CRM effectiveness depends on how it is integrated into the firm's existing processes and capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The successful implementation of CRM requires that firms carefully consider issues of customer trust and privacy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The successful implementation of CRM requires that firms carefully consider issues of consumer fairness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inappropriate and incomplete use of CRM metrics can put the firm at risk of developing core rigidities, thus leading to long-term failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Successful implementation of CRM requires that firms incorporate knowledge about competition and competitive reaction into CRM processes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective CRM implementation requires coordination of channels, technologies, customers, and employees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after going through these, though, I'm struggling for a definition. There's actually one sentence in this paper that I really like that I'm going to quote that is a good definition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed, CRM goes beyond a customer focus. Not only does CRM build relationships and use systems to collect and analyze data, but it also includes the integration of all these activities across the firm, linking these activities to both firm and customer value, extending this integration along the value chain, and developing the capability of integrating these activities across the networks of firms that collaborate to generate customer value, while creating shareholder value for the firm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you have it... a good definition for CRM. I'll use it. But of course, most people still just mean &lt;a href="http://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;Salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/1779950177234900124/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=1779950177234900124' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/1779950177234900124?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1779950177234900124'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/11/disconnect-between-crm-definitions.html' title='The Disconnect Between CRM Definitions'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-5105378635486233983</id><published>2008-11-03T16:08:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-03T16:12:31.186-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-11-03T16:12:31.186-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Recession'/><title type='text'>Recession Hits Direct Marketers</title><content type='html'>B2B Magazine has a new article &lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081013/FREE/310139972/1109/FREE"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on how the recession is hitting direct marketers.

The pioneers of this collaborative supplier / channel approach were the consumer package goods companies and the grocery stores. The idea was that by working together, suppliers and retailers (but more broadly, any type of distribution channel partner could fill in here) could improve total customer satisfaction. An early prospective study by Kurt Salmon Associates in 1993 estimated that savings from a fully implemented ECR approach industrywide would lead to value amounting to 10.8% of the retail price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More and more, this model is infiltrating technology marketing. OEMs have come to realize that the next big efficiency and effectiveness step will be through true collaboration with partners. This goes beyond "silver," "gold" and "platinum" tier levels, and using 1.5% of COGS for MDF, and goes to system integration, cross-firm teams making collaborative marketing decisions, and a far more integrated supply chain. Companies are doing this today. I don't think they're calling it ECR, but that's what they're doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three main elements of ECR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand side management.&lt;/strong&gt; This is basically a lot of what &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/"&gt;MarketBridge&lt;/a&gt; has been doing for the past several years in the high tech / channel model. OEMs and partners work together on marketing strategies. This can bring up all kinds of potential conflicts, but also can generate much higher profits by optimizing the 4 Ps across both OEM and channel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply side management.&lt;/strong&gt; This is basically streamlining the supply chain and logistics. Not really an expert here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information technology.&lt;/strong&gt; In the early 1990s it was EDI, and now it's gotten a lot more sophisticated. While OEMs and partners definitely don't totally trust each other, they understand how much power is to be gained by merging data--particularly around customer and promotion insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic case example of ECR is Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has vertically integrated with its suppliers across all three of the above elements. On the demand side, brands contribute monies for marketing and conduct marketing optimization (mix) with the distribution channel in mind. Wal-Mart has a seat at the table on this as well. Much of Wal-Mart's circular expenses (or all, probably) are funded by the suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supply chain story (2) is well known. Wal-Mart works with suppliers to minimize inventory costs and ensure the matching--in near real-time--of demand with supply on the shelves. To enable this, Wal-Mart's ERP systems are tied to their main suppliers, cutting down on inventory and shipping expenses. Wal-Mart has mandated this. These systems are the third element--total information collaboration up and down the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wal-Mart example also brings up a major concern for ECR, which is that instead of creating a federated model with relatively equal power distributed between supplier and distributor, most of the power has ended up with the increasingly consolidated retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So has ECR worked? Should technology marketers embrace it wholeheartedly? What are the implications for partner consolidation in tech? The best study on this was Corsten and Kumar (Journal of Marketing, 2005, &lt;strong&gt;Do Suppliers Benefit from Collaborative Relationships with Large Retailers? An Empirical Investigation of Efficient Customer Response Adoption.)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I think it's worth re-creating the model they develop for assessing performance, because it makes sense on its face and should be used as a reference guideposts for tech OEMs or Partners trying to assess whether ECR is a good model for them.  It's the picture at the top of the post.  Without going through all the arrows, which represent hypotheses, it basically says that &lt;strong&gt;suppliers have to have three things to play:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transaction-specific investments (investment specific to the collaborative relationship)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross-functional teams (teams to specifically support the collaborative relationship from across the business, including finance, marketing, design, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incentive systems (putting money on the line with members of the above cross-functional team to make the collaborative relationship successful.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to ECR adoption.  At this point, &lt;strong&gt;Trust&lt;/strong&gt; makes the relationship even better, as does choosing to work with retailers that have &lt;strong&gt;Good Capabilities.  &lt;/strong&gt;There is an interaction effect here too, where trust and capabilities both impact ECR adoption's impact on success, and impact results directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECR's success is evaluated with three factors--&lt;strong&gt;Economic Performance &lt;/strong&gt;(e.g. are we selling more stuff more efficiently vs. before) &lt;strong&gt;Perceived Equity &lt;/strong&gt;(do both parties feel that the collaboration is fair and no one is "hogging the value) and &lt;strong&gt;Capability Development &lt;/strong&gt;(is the collaborative relationship helping both companies become better marketers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQ8XRotNCpI/AAAAAAAAACE/jKdM3AIlDPI/s1600-h/ECRModel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQ8XRotNCpI/AAAAAAAAACE/jKdM3AIlDPI/s1600-h/ECRModel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After they loaded all their data into this model (read the paper to find out how they got the data, etc.), the basic findings were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of cyncism and mistrust still floating around between suppliers and retailers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suppliers have definitely achieved much greater economic performance due to ECR.  This is true across a broad range of suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suppliers should favor / target retailers that are trusted and smart.  These types of relationships have much better outcomes for both parties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is critical to manage perceptions and reality around fairneness.  "Negative inequity" can severely damage the supplier / partner relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications for tech marketers, on both the OEM and Partner side, are clear--ECR is a great tool and it should be adopted quickly, while using real caution around the points above.  Two things I do think are interesting are (1) the fragmentation of the partner industry in tech vs. retail and (2) the significant barriers to entry on the manufacturer / OEM side vs. CPG retail.  This, in my mind, will make fairness less of an issue in tech vs. retail.  We certainly won't see a "bullying" relationship in tech like we see with Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing tech needs to figure out is how to implement ECR with the tens of thousands of smaller, less capable partners that serve important niche markets throughout SMB.  These partners shouldn't be ignored, so is there a "lite" or "semi-custom" ECR approach for dealing with these smaller partners.  This obviously demands significant technology investment and automation of core marketing processes.  Of course, I think the answer is yes... We've started down this path already at &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/"&gt;MarketBridge&lt;/a&gt; with our DemandStream approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/4065779373274093010/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=4065779373274093010' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/4065779373274093010?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4065779373274093010'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/11/ecr-efficient-customer-response-or.html' title='ECR (Efficient Customer Response) or Collaborative Channel Marketing Applied to Tech Marketing'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQ8Xc9FeG3I/AAAAAAAAACM/YyXFkOA4nmY/s72-c/ECRModel.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-5422238013653425256</id><published>2008-10-30T13:13:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-30T13:46:41.574-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-30T13:46:41.574-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Internet Marketing'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TV'/><title type='text'>What if Don Draper was a B2B Marketer?</title><content type='html'>I was watching the &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/"&gt;Mad Men&lt;/a&gt; season finale last night on my DVR, thinking how ironic it was that I was (1) watching a show about advertising and (2) watching said show on a DVR. A show about advertising. Or for another example, if you like, a show about a show... actually a show about a show in the context of a real company (30 Rock). Have we reached the postmodern singularity event where all media implodes on itself in a giant self-aware fusion reaction? Or how about this. I was watching a show about advertising on a DVR instead of watching an historic 30 minute address by Obama. And in the show, the background plot line was Kennedy's addresses to the country on the Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see all this as a good thing for advertisers, and here's why. I am watching something. I am engaged in something in a way that I wasn't ten years ago. Ten years ago, television had reached its nadir. It was clear that post-Seinfeld, there wasn't anything not on HBO that truly captured the zeitgeist out there. But now, we have all kinds of zeitgeist forming going on all over the spectrum. SNL has managed to massively elevate its profile courtesy of Tina Feylin. John Stewart of The Daily Show continues to function as the zeitgeist puppet master. Mad Men has somehow broken into the mainstream from AMC. Quality--at least for a few shows--is way, way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's down is distribution. The switch to digital signals this fall is symbolic for most, but it does mark an important turning point. Video in all its forms will become one massive feed. Accessed through Apple TV, DVRs, "live", via Browser, or via handset, it doesn't really matter anymore. The content creation is being decoupled from the distribution--and thank God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this is really the democratization of content. The doomsayers who think that we'll see the death of (the novel; the TV show; the sitcom; the drama; etc. etc.) are clearly spectacularly wrong. We are actually seeing quality improve &lt;em&gt;because monetization potential is and will be going way up. &lt;/em&gt;Why has Mad Men been able to spend $2.5 M / show on AMC? Because they can now distribute on Apple TV / ITunes. Why is GE investing so much in SNL? Because they are getting huge pageviews on the NBC domain for SNL skits (bite sized, perfect for office viewing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My possibly naiive hope is that we'll get smarter and better entertained over the next ten years, and that marketers will thrive. As we have access to &lt;em&gt;everything we want,&lt;/em&gt; we'll be more and more targetable. Just as email marketers crave the "opt in", video marketers crave the audience that cares. There are monetization technicalities--such as the fact that there's no advertising in Apple's model--but I believe that this will work itself out through the free market. Not sure exactly how yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if Don Draper were a B2B marketer? I think he'd quit his agency and become a consumer focused Digital marketer. So I guess my post title was misleading.

I'm sure there has been a lot of newer research on the topic, but there were three key ideas that really resonated in the work. Most B2B marketers intuitively know these things, but putting them down on paper really helps. And, I like odd lists (3,5 and 7 are the best) for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to think about the work from &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; the perspective of &lt;strong&gt;yourself&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;your customers&lt;/strong&gt;. Customer perspective = needs based or latent. Your perspective = "observable" market segments like "by geography" or "customer size" or "total sales." Row realized it doesn't have to be one or the other--create segments that are actionable but also have unique customer needs profiles. Row showed that this was possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to think about companies as customers but more importantly you need to understand &lt;strong&gt;decision making units &lt;/strong&gt;inside the companies--the group of people who actually have the needs, influence and ultimately make the decision. It's these groups of people that truly have needs, read marketing material, and meet sales reps. Truly profiling the DMUs and segmenting on the basis of personalities inside these groups is where real insight comes in. This reminds of some work my friend David Bradley did at IBM back in the late 1990s. They found that DMUs with "self integrators" bought totally differently from those that mainly "needed help." This corresponded nicely with several industry segments and other firmographic data so IBM was able to make the segmentation actionable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's critical to put all segmentation through the lens of the &lt;strong&gt;transaction in question. &lt;/strong&gt;The framework used in 1980 was "new task," "modified rebuy," and "straight rebuy." New tasks obviously require much larger DMUs with different personalities involved; straight rebuys are typically done by one person and are more or less automatic. Only major shocks can disrupt an incumbent in a straight rebuy situation. Anyway, having a segmentation for "new tasks" vs. "straight rebuys" can make a lot of sense. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, these three ideas are really nice framers when embarking on any B2B segmentation work.

One of the ways that Tom was selected out of 10 billion applicants was that he bought &lt;a href="http://www.simmonberry.com/"&gt;http://www.simmonberry.com/&lt;/a&gt; among other domains. Simmon and Berry are the two ESPN guys running the league. Anyway, it's not B2B, but I guess it's marketing, and the auction thing is borderline analytics.

My company, &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/"&gt;MarketBridge&lt;/a&gt;, is investing heavily in this space, and it's made me hyper-aware of the competition across many dimensions. There are many different flavors and functions of Channel Management. I tried listing some of them (those I can think of) and I'm counting on readers to fill in missing spaces:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inventory management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order fulfillment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Point of sale data capture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner marketing campaign automation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner marketing digital asset distribution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner marketing list distribution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data analytics and reporting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner lead management / transparency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Service tracking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Channel capacity planning / coverage planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewards distribution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data aggregation / lists / proprietary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these functions seem destined to end up in one place--a channel portal--for a big company. For example, companies like IBM or Cisco have partner portals that should have all of the functions bundled, where a partner can access those features that they are "qualified" for. Some of them, like channel capacity planning, would only be availabe for the OEM. So is this where we're headed? Some kind of consolidated "PRM" space that shares much with CRM? Or does PRM just merge into CRM? This is certainly the &lt;a href="http://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt; vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to do a partial inventory of all the companies out there and organize them into a framework. I ended up settling on two dimensions: "marketing vs. operations" and "insight / strategy vs. software." I felt this was a pretty good matrix, but I might change it if people come up with some more descriptive dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here's the initial list of companies with what they're good at. Think of this as a del.icio.us bookmark list for channel management companies...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.everythingchannel.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EverythingChannel / CMP.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;This company has probably the best list of U.S. channel partners out there. They fill multiple roles and play in all kinds of channel managers' daily lives. List providers; marketing channel; information aggregator; PR vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/"&gt;MarketBridge. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Yes I'll shamelessly hawk my company. Fitting firmly on the "insight" side of the equation, we're the strategy /analytics / capacity planning expert for channel marketing in high-tech. We've built a lot of the channel strategies in use out there across many big companies. Getting into the software side of the house these days with &lt;strong&gt;DemandStream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bearingpoint.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BearingPoint.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Have a "channel management solution" and are also a key consulting player in the channel space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.channelmanagement.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel Management Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;They've firmly anchored themselves in the channel management space. Their list of capabilites, of which I can't evaluate the reality, is impressive. It spans incentive management, channel management and channel marketing. I think they're software led but also have a services arm. Clients include NetApp, AT&amp;amp;T and VMWare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rewardstream.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RewardStream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;I used them when I was doing some work at Cisco--pretty slick. Run the PRP (Partner Rewards Program) there. I think they're basically a pure software play but as far as directly motivating AEs and SEs, they are definitely top-notch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.escalate.com/"&gt;Escalate Retail. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Formerly Blue Martini, these guys are more on the retail front but I know they do a lot with management and connecting pipes in the partner space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/"&gt;Oracle / Siebel.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One of the originals for partner channel management. Strong suit is (I believe) point of sale insight, and particularly linking all this up with internal GL data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;Salesforce.com.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They've been pushing their partner solutions for a while, and with good reason. The idea of getting all partners on one CRM system--basically seeing the same thing all the time, without worrying about data security, etc.--is really cool. The problem I see with this strategy is, without a dominant market position in CRM, is everyone going to want to "switch CRMs" when working for one OEM vs. another?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blueroads.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BlueRoads.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Just saw a Blueroads demo the other day. They position themselves as more "go to market" than "partner management", which is fine. Saw digital asset management; lead management; list parsing; etc. Interface looked a bit 2001.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.netsuite.com/"&gt;NetSuite. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A SaaS partner management portal / engine is one component of NetSuite. Haven't used or reviewed it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sharemethods.com/"&gt;Share Methods. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Built around document management, this "extranet" solution is billed as a solution for partner marketing / management. Not sure how robust it is other than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.channeladvisor.com/stores/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.channeladvisor.com/stores/"&gt;Channel Advisor.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Not sure about the applicability of this, but they are out there and seem to have a solution called "store advisor" but it's exclusively for etailers... e.g. companies selling through multiple online channels. Pretty narrow but worth checking out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infonow.com/"&gt;InfoNow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; InfoNow is definitely one of the biggest / best companies out there from a channel management perspective. Their strength is in aggregation of point of sale (POS) data and providing a holistic view of performance across channels. Their front page really trumpets this ability--for a true view of end customer dynamics in a tiered distribution model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributors. &lt;/strong&gt;The big distributors--Ingram, TechData, etc.--are essentially positioned as solutions providers across partner management. At least, they should be. I think they are getting it and will be much powerful as general channel management solution providers soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/2469593042765783353/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=2469593042765783353' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/2469593042765783353?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2469593042765783353'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/channel-management-solutions-landscape.html' title='Channel Management Solutions Landscape 1'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQYzyPQmd4I/AAAAAAAAAB0/PRMYl1SSEFU/s72-c/channelmanagement.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-1042902719260932972</id><published>2008-10-24T12:35:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-24T12:39:57.930-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-24T12:39:57.930-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='research'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pipeline'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lead Management'/><title type='text'>B2B Pipeline Optimization</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQH6LVq1RdI/AAAAAAAAABs/17M1wF5s-4U/s1600-h/Pipeline.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5260760912447751634" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 272px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQH6LVq1RdI/AAAAAAAAABs/17M1wF5s-4U/s400/Pipeline.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting case study available on &lt;a href="http://www.market-bridge.com/"&gt;http://www.market-bridge.com/&lt;/a&gt; on pipeline optimization for Siemens Medical. Basically, the idea was to take a look at pipeline performance and benchmark against best-in-class competition at each stage. Gaps in performance have a cumulative effect through the funnel... each funnel stage is addressed through a specific process improvement. The results in terms of revenue impact were pretty extraordinary (about $100M over 18 months.)

One of the first things anyone doing marketing needs to understand is the size of the market. This isn't complex segmentation by any means. It's based on "observable" factors--not on latent customer factors. It's a factual overview of the marketplace. From this initial jumping off point, a marketer can get crazy with latent class analysis and five factors segmentations, but basic market sizing will always be the first step for a B2B marketer in a product line.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The question is, how can a Marketing Manager / Director do this task without paying McKinsey or Bain a million bucks? Well, said person can do it themselves. Will it be as accurate or insightful? Not a chance. But it'll provide 60% of the value at 5% of the price.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Given how important and basic the task is, there's a lot of different ways to approach it. I'm not claiming to be the expert here, so I definitely welcome comments on other methods. That being said, here's a strawman.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a priori segmentation dimensions.&lt;/strong&gt; Follow your business's conventions. For example, if a cut-off point in defining SMB is companies less than 500 employees, use this. Keep things as industry standard as possible. Don't use industry classifications that aren't used by the Department of Labor. Keep it to three dimensions max. Three that work are Size * Geography * Industry. You want 30 cells max. So, three cells for size, three for geography, and 2-3 for industry work great. Once you have your grid of all possible cells, write in each what you want to know. For example, # of PCs purchased per year; typical buyer title; total IT budget; etc. This will function as your question list when you get to step 3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimate total # of companies in each cell. &lt;/strong&gt;You have your 30 cells, now you need to know how many companies there are in each. I'd use publicly available resources to get to this. Bureau of Labor is best; also analyst reports on specific industries cite data and these can usually be gotten free (e.g. if you have a brokerage account, these days they'll give you free research.) You'll never get exact, so the key is triangulation. Get more than 1 data source and build ranges for each cell. Make sure you write down all your sources and assumptions for each in an appendix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualitative interviews. &lt;/strong&gt;You don't really know anything until you talk to people. Call into some accounts that meet the criteria for each cell. Get creative, use a phone book. In SMB this is pretty easy; in Enterprise it's not as hard as you think. Just tell the truth, say you're calling from X company and you're doing informal research to help improve service for their company. If the person isn't the right person, get the name of who is. You'll get a 1 in 5 hit rate. This was my first job out of college--it's amazing how willing professionals are to talk to other professionals. Ask them the questions from your grid, 1o max. Get 2-3 (or more if you're having fun) responses per cell. You now have a rough market sizing. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantitative (optional). &lt;/strong&gt;At this point, you can engage a market research firm to add more quantitative depth to the insight gained from step 3. I'd do 25-30 responses per cell. So, 900 completes max. Survey should be 5 minutes max. You can do this for $30,000. This will get you much better precision to your market sizing exercise, and managers will likely pay for it once they see the insight coming out of step 3. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once this basic analysis is done, execs will be much more willing to fund more in-depth projects on customer needs; researching how decision making units (DMUs) work; understanding future trends; etc., etc. But you can't do the really interesting work until you've sized the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/3367731683111599774/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=3367731683111599774' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/3367731683111599774?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3367731683111599774'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/b2b-market-sizing-on-cheap.html' title='B2B Market Sizing on the Cheap'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SQHqQje4nXI/AAAAAAAAABk/Bak3WWR2fWI/s72-c/MarketSizing.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-4825133623115935181</id><published>2008-10-21T13:25:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-21T13:49:17.296-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-21T13:49:17.296-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Segmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Predictive Modeling'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='data mining'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vendors'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='marketing mix optimization'/><title type='text'>"How to Choose the Right Marketing Analytics Partner?"  Buy a Solution to a Business Problem, Not Bodies.</title><content type='html'>BtoB has a thing in the October 13 issue about &lt;a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081013/FREE/310139942&amp;amp;SearchID=73333648470681"&gt;"how to choose the right analytics partner."&lt;/a&gt;  The summary factors for decision making are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Industry expertise&lt;br /&gt;2. Skills and resources&lt;br /&gt;3. Process&lt;br /&gt;4. Cultural fit&lt;br /&gt;5. Intellectual property&lt;br /&gt;6. Data security&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all important factors, and they're all on my list... but having been on the vendor side for a while, I think this article misses a critical point.  First of all, &lt;strong&gt;analytics is kind of a nonsense word.&lt;/strong&gt;  You heard it here first--analytics as a term has lost all its meaning for most business people today... Kind of like CRM did in the 1990s.  So, just going out and looking for an "analytics firm" is not going to work.  You're looking for a business problem / solution firm.  There are a ton of firms that can do analytics--literally any consulting firm with economics or marketing or statistics PhDs--but they'll do everything custom and it'll be expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case example: Mix optimization literally shares nothing in common with data mining.  These are apples and oranges from a marketing perspective, and the only thing they have in common is some kind of statistics is used to solve them.  Furthermore, you might say "mix optimization... OK I'll go get an econometrics firm."  Wrong again... while econometrics is a tool used for mix optimization, what you really should be buying is a &lt;strong&gt;solution.  You're buying the increase in marketing performance, not the analysis.  Truth be told, econometrics isn't playing much of a role at all in B2B mix optimization... at least not in the studies I've seen.  &lt;/strong&gt;Trite, been there done that, bla bla bla but it's true.  You are buying a methodology that's been done 50 times with an 80% common approach.  You are not buying analytics.  It's why I think a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_outsourcing"&gt;BPO model &lt;/a&gt;is going to overtake marketing analytics completely in the next five years.  I'm sure many will disagree here... If so please leave comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another example--analytics around business partner channels.  Yes, this is what MarketBridge is good at, it's what we do really well, so I'm biased, but it's true.  We've optimized partner coverage or done cooperative analytics with partners 100s of times.  We know the business objectives--there are 4 or 5 that are repeated across the tech industry.  We know the data structure.  We do it more efficiently and effectively.  Thus, when you buy a "channel analytics" project from MarketBridge, you're buying ten years of experience, a database structure that is 90% complete, and most imporantly, 20% more partner capacity or 30% better partner loyalty or 50% better through-partner marketing performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or yet another example--B2C segmentation.  You go to a firm that's done it 100s of times.  And you're not buying the best predictive segmentation latent class analysis, you're buying a firm that can deliver a segmentation to meet 2 or 3 or 4 business objectives.  So the advise is--don't buy a segmentation project.  Buy a business objective--the segmentation will come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underlying trend driving this is actually outsourcing.  Just having a bunch of PhDs is now not a differentiator.  PhDs are cheap and all of them can do regression analysis.  These overseas body shops will work for between $50 and $100 an hour.  They require a lot of handholding, but they're good for certain grunt tasks.  This cost pressure has forced premium firms to own business problems, and the core:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data assets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analytic models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Killer variables"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;associated with them.  In the long run, this trend is only going to improve B2B marketing in a big way as the space starts to mature.  In fact, I think it's only through adopting this BPO approach that B2B marketing analytics reaches scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/4825133623115935181/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=4825133623115935181' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/4825133623115935181?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4825133623115935181'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-choose-right-marketing-analytics.html' title='&quot;How to Choose the Right Marketing Analytics Partner?&quot;  Buy a Solution to a Business Problem, Not Bodies.'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-719137601312767458</id><published>2008-10-20T11:18:00.005-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-20T13:08:14.711-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-20T13:08:14.711-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='data mining'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CRM'/><title type='text'>Predicting Growth Companies for Sales Coverage</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SPyqzoynx-I/AAAAAAAAABc/9iC47WAKqrU/s1600-h/PredictingGrowth.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259266268961687522" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SPyqzoynx-I/AAAAAAAAABc/9iC47WAKqrU/s400/PredictingGrowth.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of companies are looking for ways to find the highest potential customers and cover them more aggressively. This is really a key tenant of predictive modeling in the B2B arena--if you can find the customers that will grow, and get them while they're small, you'll ride the curve up with them providing you can keep them loyal (a whole other conversation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenge with this is two-fold. First, you have to find the data to do the modeling. Second, you need to understand the right independent variables that predict future growth. This type of modeling can be done for either Enterprise or SMB, but I think it's got the most potential in SMB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to do this is to look at year-over-year growth in sales as a dependent variable. The challenge is that year-over-year growth stats are notoriously unreliable from D&amp;amp;B and InfoUSA. One option to get around this is fielding a study with both behavioral questions that are "in the database" (either a purchased list, or the customer database) and the dependent variable, growth in year-over-year sales. We could also ask some hypothesized predictive growth variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This study could either be a time series study where we're asking the same companies year after year (most accurate), or we could ask people to "remember" what their revenues were in the past. The trouble is, we'd also need to ask them to "remember" what the predictive variables had been, as well, which is really hard and will probably be biased and wrong. So, I'd definitely recommend implementing a year over year panel. Yes, this screams out for a syndicated data approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we have our data set, we can now do our modeling. The basic approach is a predictive analysis like multivariate regression, where we use year-over-year revenue growth as the dependent variable, and we use a bunch of other firmographic variables as predictors. The key is finding the right predictors. What are some predictors we've seen work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age of CEO or Principal--the lower the age, the higher the future growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industry micro-vertical--oftentimes, specific micro-verticals outperform peers depending on macroeconomic conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Past revenue growth--while past performance is not necessarily predictive of the future, it usually is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recent equity injections or total debt load--companies with more cash tend to grow faster than those that are funding with operating cash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geographic area--specifically in certain SMB verticals (retail, services, dining, etc.) taking a look at those geographies that are growing faster than others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are ton of other ones that could work, but the key is really getting to an "account growth" scoring algorithm that we can then use as one factor for segmenting account coverage. This can also be used to score partners. For some large B2B companies with literally tens of thousands of registered partners, any approach to distinguish the best from the unwashed masses will be very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/719137601312767458/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=719137601312767458' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/719137601312767458?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/719137601312767458'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/predicting-growth-companies-for-sales.html' title='Predicting Growth Companies for Sales Coverage'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SPyqzoynx-I/AAAAAAAAABc/9iC47WAKqrU/s72-c/PredictingGrowth.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-3874266878192969727</id><published>2008-10-15T17:32:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-15T18:00:21.095-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-15T18:00:21.095-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Predictive Modeling'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pipeline'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lead Management'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Recession'/><title type='text'>Lead Qualification in the New (Bad) Economy</title><content type='html'>I was talking today to Marketing Sherpa.  They're wondering if any B2B companies are using analytics to qualify leads on the basis of their "health" or "likelihood to close" given contracting budgets.  I wasn't aware of anything specific, but it's certainly SOP in B2C.  Car Insurance, for example, are qualifying "real value" all the time just on the basis of the numbers people fill in on display ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Businesses do it with BANT--budget, authority, need, timing.  This is obviously still in play in today's environment, maybe even more so.  However, is there another way to do it that keeps track of industry dynamics... the micro dynamics in an economy?  For a company like Microsoft or Cisco that is getting literally 1000s of leads a day through search, display, partners, inbound call centers--what if they could prioritize these leads on the basis of "real economic activity?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's an embryonic idea, so pardon if it's a bit crude.  The idea is that you take a look at trailing 3 month data on "proposal to close" discrete events.  So you're looking for proposals that closed and proposals that actually were lost.  Then you'd put a data mining algorithm on it against all the industry and firmographic data you had on the close.  So you'd be looking at city, SIC code, company size, etc... all of the variables that are relevant from an economic perspective.  This could give you a predictive model that changed daily on which companies are more likely to close in a tough economic environment, and would facilitate reprioritization of closing efforts on these types of companies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'd have to be careful on bias here, obviously.  But, I think it's an interesting idea.  You could even enrich the data with region-specific industry insights.  E.g. if the beige book shows a bright spot for small manufacturers around Philadelphia, you could manually crank up that part of the model. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Descriptive statistics would be interesting, too.  A daily report could be built showing changes in close rates by company type (SIC code), geography, etc.  This could be compared to economic data and would provide a good macroeconomic headlights tool for a B2B company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These same ideas could work at all stages of the pipeline.  I guess this is my first post about specifically "marketing in the sucky economy" and I know everyone's going there now.  Time to rev up the contra funds and jump on the bandwagon.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/3874266878192969727/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=3874266878192969727' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/3874266878192969727?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3874266878192969727'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/lead-qualification-in-new-bad-economy.html' title='Lead Qualification in the New (Bad) Economy'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-4829846308988227220</id><published>2008-10-07T11:12:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-07T11:31:23.792-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-07T11:31:23.792-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Event Detection'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Predictive Modeling'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='data mining'/><title type='text'>How to Model Events</title><content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;I've been thinking a lot lately about events, I guess because of the financial crisis.&lt;/strong&gt;  The events of the financial crisis could have been avoided if we'd been able to predict them better.  And, now that the banks left standing are picking up the pieces, they need to start thinking about winning customers again.  In banking, event detection is a poweful tool for cross-sell and customer retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events are things that happen in time and are discrete.  A bank collapsing.  A baby being born.  A president being elected.  These are all events.  Marketers are interested in events because they help us organize our communications around the event in question.  What's nice about events is that before they happen, we sometimes can predict them with other data.  And after events happen, we absolutely know they did happen.  If it happened, we can tag it with a "1" and state the time it happened, who it happened to, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Event detection" marketing is pretty simple, in concept.  A customer defaults on a mortage.  We send them a phone call telling them to pay or else.  A customer opens a new credit card account.  A customer care rep calls them and thanks them and tries to upsell them on credit protection.  This is what I call "reactive" event detection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about "predictive" event detection?  A lot of events are big, life changing things that, if we really could predict them, would give us a huge advantage.  An example of this is marriage.  Wouldn't it be more effective to predict a marriage 3 months ahead of schedule than to find out about it when an individual checking account is created?  We could produce an integrated campaign that would get the newly married couple set up with joint checking, life insurance, and a financial consult. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most of the growth in marketing is going to come in this area.  Using customer insight to predict events on the basis of past events, and "marketing to the prediction".  To do this, though, we need much better historical data.  We need to understand past events that we "can market to" and mark them in time.  How would a bank collect this data?  Through branch tellers in a CRM system... through their online site... but importantly, it requires a long-term view.  If we have a year or so of this data, we can start to model these discrete events and understand how account behavior predicts them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B2B marketers can do this too.  Data in a B2B environment mimic those available to a customer-centric B2C marketer, in many ways.  There is generally very rich contextual data around accounts.  CRM systems, if used, can integrate powerful customer service data, inbound call histories, and account maps for use as independent variables.  I guess what I'll finish with is the importance of "starting from the end."  Don't think about the independent variables--think about what you're going to offer a customer when something happens, and work backwards from there.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/4829846308988227220/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=4829846308988227220' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/4829846308988227220?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4829846308988227220'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-model-events.html' title='How to Model Events'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-7871050212579396501</id><published>2008-10-06T18:13:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-06T18:14:32.682-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-06T18:14:32.682-04:00</app:edited><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SOqNo7SEt_I/AAAAAAAAABU/Rlsav4-WNKs/s1600-h/search+logo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5254167649528887282" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SOqNo7SEt_I/AAAAAAAAABU/Rlsav4-WNKs/s400/search+logo.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/7871050212579396501?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/7871050212579396501'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/blog-post.html' title=''/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_30veOO2AATQ/SOqNo7SEt_I/AAAAAAAAABU/Rlsav4-WNKs/s72-c/search+logo.jpg' height='72' width='72'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-2379891545071917800</id><published>2008-10-06T16:52:00.004-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-06T17:42:15.078-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2008-10-06T17:42:15.078-04:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Influencers'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Public Relations'/><title type='text'>The Digital PR Dilemma</title><content type='html'>Public relations used to be straightforward.  A company would manage its reputation through communications to the "press" which would then diseminate these points of view through various media channels.  Perceptions would be measured periodically.  Damage control was also straightforward--after a crisis, go to every media channel you know and give interviews to control the spin.  This model has gone extinct over the past 36 months as online dialogue has taken a life of its own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere is this more apparent than in politics.  While McCain and Obama can release factoids or give interviews, these factoids are very quickly shaped and distorted online.  A vivid example was McCain's announcement of his campaign suspension to focus on the financial rescue two weeks ago.  This was twisted very quickly across media channels and on the blogosphere.  The message boards on Digg were full of people proclaiming their cynicism.  Varios media pundits across all kinds of channels were analyzing and twisting, and within hours, it was apparent that McCain's tactic had been twisted into something negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could argue that Obama has this figured out more than McCain.  Granted, he has a much more positive online personae, but his "slow and steady" approach is much less vulnerable to the digital PR twisting machine.  If you don't give the "digital machine" too many things to work with, it won't engage and twist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is a B2B marketer to do?  PR is still important--in fact I'd argue it's more important than ever.  With this being said, it's also a totally new discipline vs. what is was five years ago.  A digital PR manager has to understand the digital environment from three perspectives--"inbound", "outbound", and "community." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The inbound function is the "listening" function.  This isn't a quarterly or even a monthly function, it's someone who's out there listening to what's being said across various online feedback mechanisms.  There are tools to do this, but it's possible to do without high tech "scrapers."  A PR professional should map out his core audiences and understand where they congregate and exchange ideas online, and monitor them on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The outbound function is putting out information--through formal company channels--to attempt to control the online discourse.  There is a careful "empathy" to this, though.  Through trial and error, the digital PR expert must disemminate information that does not insult the audience's intelligence but still gets the point across.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The community function is perhaps the least understood.  There is all kinds of buzz about "engaging the community" with "influencers" but I haven't seen it done effectively &lt;em&gt;unless the brand is already strong.&lt;/em&gt;  Apple has engaged its community... but it's really more like its community has engaged it.  How does an unpopular brand actually engage its community, other than through "better behavior?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's the upshot of this.  With the democratization of information, it's harder and harder to put out false spin.  It is, however, possible for those companies with compelling value propositions and messages to get the truth out there and correct falsehoods.  In any case, PR is clearly more important--and more complicated--than it ever has been for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/2379891545071917800/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=2379891545071917800' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/2379891545071917800?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/2379891545071917800'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2008/10/digital-pr-dilemma.html' title='The Digital PR Dilemma'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-4775512703560155368</id><published>2007-10-05T21:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-10-05T21:38:34.706-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2007-10-05T21:38:34.706-04:00</app:edited><title type='text'>Engagement Marketing, Part 1 of 3</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_30veOO2AATQ/RwbmvsyzHcI/AAAAAAAAABM/YT-EmhpeKME/s1600-h/relationship+marketing.png"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5118031733705612738" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_30veOO2AATQ/RwbmvsyzHcI/AAAAAAAAABM/YT-EmhpeKME/s400/relationship+marketing.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'll be publishing a draft of a white paper I've just written in three parts... Sorry for how long it's been since my last post.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Putting the Relationship Back in Relationship Marketing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving Value through Customer Engagement and Advocacy&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The goal of Relationship Marketing (RM) is to develop and maintain a base of committed customers who generate profit for the organization. Nowhere is RM more important than in the B2B context, where continued business from an established client base generates the lion’s share of revenue. While RM initiatives are standard in B2B enterprises, marketers seldom adopt a rigorous, data-driven approach to understanding and managing their ongoing interaction with customers and the impact of RM activities on their business. In this paper, we propose that managed customer engagement is a critical path to promoting advocacy for your brand and driving business results. We describe insights gained from years of client work across a range of industries and outline steps for developing an analytics-based RM engagement management and tracking system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;A Conceptual Framework&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will focus on two constructs that we have shown to be the mechanisms through which relationship marketing tactics impact business results: 1) customers’ ongoing behavioral engagement with a company, and 2) their advocacy for a firm and its product offerings. We have found that in B2B environments, proactive engagement of line-of-business decision makers (LOBs) at client accounts is a fundamental driver of these individuals’ perceptions of your brand and their willingness to advocate continued and expanded business with your firm. We maintain that the fundamental job of RM is to manage LOB engagement and promote advocacy – the vehicles through which marketing can expedite customers’ progression through the sales pipeline and generate incremental value for your business. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Mass Market LOB is conscious of the firm’s offerings, but hasn’t formed interest in the products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Seeker is interested in learning about the firm’s offerings, (i.e., its capabilities, pricing, and positioning) but has not yet taken a position on its appropriateness to his/her business needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Convert has determined that products are appropriate and has begun to form a favorable impression of, and willingness to advocate for, the brand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;An Advocate has established a highly favorable impression and is strongly inclined toward recommending and/or purchasing the product&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We (MarketBridge) have demonstrated the importance of advocacy by statistically validating its role in driving value for clients across several industries. Using customer survey data to define advocacy and sales databases to measure account-level wins, we have shown that higher advocacy is associated with greater incremental sales and generated revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/4775512703560155368/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=4775512703560155368' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/4775512703560155368?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4775512703560155368'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2007/10/engagement-marketing-part-1-of-3.html' title='Engagement Marketing, Part 1 of 3'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_30veOO2AATQ/RwbmvsyzHcI/AAAAAAAAABM/YT-EmhpeKME/s72-c/relationship+marketing.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36395142.post-5181924152060662404</id><published>2007-01-03T13:19:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T13:34:17.030-05:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'>2007-01-03T13:34:17.030-05:00</app:edited><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='statistics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Predictive Modeling'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='data mining'/><title type='text'>Holdout Validation: Time-Based or Not?</title><content type='html'>Happy New Year, B2B marketers and analytics types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm working on a predictive modeling project where we're trying to forecast whether or not a lead will turn into something else.  The project has been mainly focused, as such projects always are, on data collection and generating business hypotheses.  There are a couple of issues, though, that I thought I'd surface in the blog that are very analytical in nature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first issue is choosing what model type to use.  I've always liked logistic regression because it is 100% mathematical and has reliable diagnostics.  These models also tend to be simple.  However, they don't always work very well.  For one of our sub-models, we've branched out and tried a C5.0 algorithm.  This algorithm--at first blush, anyway--blew away the logistic regression model.  The gains charts were like night and day.  However, when we ran the validation data against it, the model stopped looking so great.  My hypothesis as to why this happens--classification algorithms based on branching or tree logic are much more vulnerable to confounding by spurious data than logistic regression.  They are kind of "black boxes" and are much more vulnerable to complexity.  Anyone have any thoughts on this?  We'll continue looking at multiple techniques, but we'll also make sure to always do a thorough validation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is choosing a validation data set.  There are two schools of thought on this one.  I used to think that you should always use most recent period data to train a model, and then test it on a holdout of data from that same period.  Say you have 24 months of lead data, for example.  You would train the model on all 24 months, and then test it on a holdout from the same 24 months (say, 30% of the population.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other approach is to train on older data and then test on more recent data.  The advantages to this is that you are hopefully ensuring that the model will work over a long period of time and won't work for only a few months.  But, on the flip side, you are potentially ignoring your must valuable set of predictor data--the most recent stuff.  I can see the merits of both approaches.  I think I've settled on always using both approaches--modeling with the recent data included and not included.  If the model holds up reasonably well with older data, it's a good sign the model is robust.  But, if the more recent data shows a slightly better fit, why not actually field this model?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/5181924152060662404/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36395142&amp;postID=5181924152060662404' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/36395142/posts/default/5181924152060662404?v=2'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/5181924152060662404'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2bmarketingconfidential.blogspot.com/2007/01/holdout-validation-time-based-or-not.html' title='Holdout Validation: Time-Based or Not?'/><author><name>Andy Hasselwander</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12869868619437363614</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>5</thr:total></entry></feed>
