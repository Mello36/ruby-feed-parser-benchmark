I often need to explain to my friends why retailers and media use the term "Black Friday" in referring to the day after Thanksgiving. After all, it's a rather ominous term to attach to the much ballyhooed "busiest shopping day of the year." </p>

<p>(The term derives from retailers moving from "in the red" to "in the black" on their balance sheets as the holiday season can bring them nearly 30% of their annual revenues.)</p>

<p>But, sadly, this past Friday lived up to its name. If you've not yet heard, in promoting “Black Friday” sales. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/29/business/29walmart.html">crowd at a New York-based WalMart</a> that started waiting as early as 9pm Thursday--which swelled to as many as 2,000 by 5am Friday--got angry, mobbed the store, removed the doors from the hinges, and trampled a male employee and a pregnant female. 



</p>



<p>And, in my opinion, this is a <strong><span style="font-size: 1.4em;">BIG black mark</span></strong> for the marketing profession. While it happened at Walmart, the practice of big sales and scarcity strategies are not at all limited to the nation's largest retailer... and some simple preparations could have saved lives (literally) while still assuring high sales. Or, said from a responsible marketing standpoint: it would have put people ahead of profits. Sigh.<br> </p>

With all this talk on politics we marketers find ourselves talking about, well, marketing. </p>

<p><strong>After all, (as I've analyzed <a href="http://www.mpdailyfix.com/2008/08/conventions_08_come_chat_it_up.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mpdailyfix.com/2008/09/conventions_08_round_2_with_br.html">here</a>), these politicians are truly "brands" with their campaigns the equivalent of full-throttle, high-octane, marketing campaigns.</strong></p>

<p>So in mid-October <a href="http://www.marketersstudio.com">David Berkowitz</a>, <a href="http://www.trellist.com">Michael Leis</a> and <a href="http://tangerinetoad.blogspot.com">Alan Wolk</a> joined me for a 'panelcast" to discuss the many marketing lessons of the '08 Election where we went through a host of topics--spanning positioning, messaging, marketing surprises, blunders, buzzwords, and more. We dished for well over an hour (yes, we marketers are mouthy beings) and we've captured some of the highlights for you below... in quick, 3-minute segments.</p>

<p>As we enter the last lap of Election '08, don't forget to vote and, for the love of all things marketing (!), don't forget the many branding lessons we've learned throughout this election process. The segments below focus on positioning, blunders and surprises, respectively. (And more might be coming.)</p>

A year and a half ago, an online conversation between two marketing
professionals in the U.S. and Australia evolved into a collaborative
writing effort by more than 100 bloggers from nine countries contributing content (via 400-word chapters) that created a book called The Age of Conversation... and I was one of those proud authors.</p>

<p>The project raised
nearly $15,000 for Variety, the international children's charity.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>
Following the success of the first book, which was published in the
summer of 2007, <a href="http://www.drewsmarketingminute.com">Drew McLellan</a> and<a href="http://www.servantofchaos.com"> Gavin Heaton</a>, organizers of the first
project, have now published <span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Age of Conversation 2</strong></span>, which compiles
written thoughts on the role of&nbsp; conversation in marketing today <span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><strong>from
237 marketing professionals</strong></span> who blog in the U.S. and 15 other
countries... and once again, I'm proud to be one of those authors.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Pricing for The Age of Conversation 2 is as follows (with all proceeds going to charity, no author is profiting from this collaborative venture):</strong>


</p>

<ul><li>
e-book: $12.50&nbsp; ($10.00 going to charity)</li>

<li>
paperback book: $19.95 ($8.02 to charity)</li>

<li>
hardback book: $29.95 ($4.60 to charity)</li></ul>

</div>]]></content:encoded><description>A year and a half ago, an online conversation between two marketing professionals in the U.S. and Australia evolved into a collaborative writing effort by more than 100 bloggers from nine countries contributing content (via 400-word chapters) that created a book called The Age of Conversation... and I was one of those proud authors. The project raised nearly $15,000 for Variety, the international children's charity. Following the success of the first book, which was published in the summer of 2007, Drew McLellan and Gavin Heaton, organizers of the first project, have now published Age of Conversation 2, which compiles written thoughts on the role of conversation in marketing today from 237 marketing professionals who blog in the U.S. and 15 other countries... and once again, I'm proud to be one of those authors. Pricing for The Age of Conversation 2 is as follows (with all proceeds going to charity, no author is profiting from this collaborative venture): e-book: $12.50 ($10.00 going to charity) paperback book: $19.95 ($8.02 to charity) hardback book: $29.95 ($4.60 to charity) Purchases can be made at www.lulu.com/ageofconversationBios of all authors located hereLinks to all authors' blogs after the jump if you're reading this on my blog (otherwise the list is part of the full post if you're reading this in RSS or email form).

While I've been thoroughly enjoying Election '08 both from the standpoint of riveted citizen and that of curious marketer, one thing that I've also enjoyed is all the fun.</p>

<p>And thanks to my friends at <a href="http://www.Glubble.com">Glubble</a>--most especially the extremely talented <a href="http://glubble.com/the_glubble_team">Bartel Scheers</a>--now we can all enjoy some Election '08 Memorabilia. </p>

<p>When he sent these to me, I swear it was like Christmas came early and thus I had to take a break from marketing posts to share the fun with my readers. Yup, you can download all four candidates and create your very own set of "Political Play Art Pals" (note: "Play Art" is a type of downloadable art that Glubble creates whereas you can construct all sorts of fun characters and creatures). 



</p>

And the best thing is, you don't have to buy four happy meals to get all four Play Art Pals--so, all the fun sans all the cholesterol! </strong></span>You can see them pictured throughout this post, but you'll just need to download the PDFs, cut 'em out and construct them (all downloads are below). It's best if you use thick paper and a color printer but most any paper will do.</p>

<p>I should point out what "<a href="http://www.Glubble.com">Glubble</a>" is being it's brand new to the scene--it's an online activity center for families with kids under 12. Along with offering a fun, safe environment for kids to surf and play on the Web, it offers the entire family a private way to chat with one another online, organize their family's to-do list, privately upload pictures and play games that help kids learn much-needed skills like reading, counting, even learning foreign languages.

</div>]]></content:encoded><description>While I've been thoroughly enjoying Election '08 both from the standpoint of riveted citizen and that of curious marketer, one thing that I've also enjoyed is all the fun. And thanks to my friends at Glubble--most especially the extremely talented Bartel Scheers--now we can all enjoy some Election '08 Memorabilia. When he sent these to me, I swear it was like Christmas came early and thus I had to take a break from marketing posts to share the fun with my readers. Yup, you can download all four candidates and create your very own set of "Political Play Art Pals" (note: "Play Art" is a type of downloadable art that Glubble creates whereas you can construct all sorts of fun characters and creatures). And the best thing is, you don't have to buy four happy meals to get all four Play Art Pals--so, all the fun sans all the cholesterol! You can see them pictured throughout this post, but you'll just need to download the PDFs, cut 'em out and construct them (all downloads are below). It's best if you use thick paper and a color printer but most any paper will do. I should point out what "Glubble" is being it's brand new to the scene--it's an online activity center for families with kids under 12. Along with offering a fun, safe environment for kids to surf and play on the Web, it offers the entire family a private way to chat with one another online, organize their family's to-do list, privately upload pictures and play games that help kids learn much-needed skills like reading, counting, even learning foreign languages.

Yet another week that promises to be chock full of politics. <strong>But this one is a wee bit different: because this week ends on an opening.</strong> That's right, the <a href="http://wthefilm.com/">much-hyped 'W'</a>, Oliver Stone’s newest film that comically chronicles George W. Bush’s rise and fall, launches this Friday.</p>

<p> From the movie's official <a href="http://wthefilm.com/">Web site</a>, here’s the synopsis: <em>“Whether you love him or hate him, there is no question that George W. Bush is one of the most controversial public figures in recent memory. In an unprecedented undertaking, Oliver Stone is bringing the life of our 43rd President to the big screen as only he can. W. takes viewers through Bush’s eventful life—his struggles and triumphs, how he found both his wife and his faith, and of course the critical days leading up to Bush’s decision to invade Iraq.”
</em></p>

<p> Yes, I’m intending on seeing the film and, yes, I'm well aware that a movie "based on a true story” may not include the entire story (or may not get the story entirely right). But I want to ask you, my fellow marketers, your thoughts:

<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you predict the movie will soar, or sink? Is the film a brilliant move on Oliver Stone’s part... or is the film debuting at a time when an already politically overloaded nation is worn-out on all things "W."? <br></strong></p>

<p>Weigh-in with your thoughts <a href="http://www.mpdailyfix.com/2008/10/brainy_bold_or_boguswhat_say_y.html">right over here</a>. (Since the full post and discussion is <a href="http://www.mpdailyfix.com/2008/10/brainy_bold_or_boguswhat_say_y.html">over here</a>, I've closed comments on this post...they'll be open again with my next post, worry not!) </p>

Back in May when I <a href="http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/2008/05/just-because-it.html">spoke at Sun's Startup Camp</a> (in San Francisco), I was approached by Carsten Rubsaamen and Ralf Schmelter who asked me if I would participate in a video interview as part of their &quot;<a href="http://www.ventureroadtrip.com/">Venture Road Trip</a>&quot; Project. </p>



<p>You see, Carsten and Ralf are <span class="style_2">post-graduate students</span> from <span class="style_2">Germany</span> who, as part of their studies, traveled through the U.S. for 90 days in order to <span class="style_2">study similarities and differences between American and European startup success stories</span>. They stopped in the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Las Vegas and ended in NYC.<br /> </p>

<p>They interviewed <span class="style_2">a score of high-impact serial entrepreneurs and investors</span>
on their personal stories and experiences in building up companies--from small early-stage technology startups to paradigm-shifting companies like Amazon, Google, and Yahoo. When they asked if I would be interviewed I agreed...but&nbsp; I told them that instead of interviewing just me, I thought it would be far more interesting for them to interview several specialists who could discuss social media.<br /> </p>







<p>So we turned it into a video panel by tapping three of my NYC colleagues--<a href="http://www.marketersstudio.com/">David Berkowitz</a>, <a href="http://insightbydesign.blogspot.com/">Paul Soldera</a> and <a href="http://tangerinetoad.blogspot.com/">Alan Wolk</a>. </p>

<p>Being that we're covering a lot of ground when discussing social media, you can imagine that an
hour just flew by. But that's a lot to consume in one viewing. So Carsten and Ralf split the panel discussion into nine video segments separated by nine questions (some of the segments are almost 4 minutes, some are 9). I've
featured two segments below--but the entire series is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ventureroadtrip">right here</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of good takeaways in the videos, but the big one that I'd like to leave you with is this: Next time someone asks you for an interview, think of your audience, and how it might just be a lot better to include a bunch of perspectives, not just your own. </p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">After all, isn't a world of perspectives the true value of social media? </span></strong></p>

<p>(yup, that's a rhetorical question)</p>
<p><strong>This segment (running at 3:44 minutes) focuses on the question &quot;How has marketing changed with the 'new guard' of social media?&quot;</strong> 

</p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/C6yFL1OPtVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/C6yFL1OPtVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>

<p><strong>And this segment (running at 3:17 minutes) focuses on the question &quot;With so many social media tools available to entrepreneurs and startups, how to decide which tool is best for your company?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DHjtQAe2-04&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><embed width="425" height="344" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DHjtQAe2-04&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></embed></object></p>

<p>The <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3pxtpv">information is here</a> and if you want to attend please send an email to Liana at <a href="mailto:Liana@vinebergcommunications.com">this email address</a>.

Just tell her that CK sent you and that you, too, wish you could be a kid again (if only for one day).</description><feedburner:origLink>http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/2008/09/bye-bye-big-app.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Through the eyes of a marketer: ServiceNation's Summit</title><link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ck-Blog/~3/392689162/marketing-thoug.html</link><category>#SN08</category><category>ServiceNation</category><category>ServiceNation Summit</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">CK (Christina Kerley)</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2008 10:02:20 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:typepad.com,2003:post-55589634</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[

Having just come off of <a href="http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/2008/09/to-be-among-lea.html">ServiceNation's Summit</a> I'm aflutter with thoughts. It's not every day that I attend an event with 500+ leaders of non-profit, NGO and social change organizations. And it's certainly not every day that I get to be at an event with such notables as Barack Obama, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, Jon Bon Jovi, Usher, the CEOs of AARP, Habitat for Humanity and the list goes on. And on. </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=425,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.ck-blog.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/14/dsc01352_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/images/2008/09/14/dsc01352_2.jpg" title="Dsc01352_2" alt="Dsc01352_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
The event left me humbled and heartened; I guess the best way to put it is that the event left me affected. And I admit to
wiping tears from my eyes when Hillary Clinton hit the stage. Whether you voted for her or not, she has done momentous, moving things in her career. Matter of fact, whether you agree with the views or parties of any of the political leaders that were present, I hope we can all agree that these people have accomplished much (as anything else would be downright myopic).</p>

<p>And I give compliments to BOTH presidential candidates for doing well at Thursday night's Presidential Summit. I didn't come at this event to judge, but to listen. You see, this event was not a debate because this event was about uniting us all around something on which we all agree: <strong>the need to place service, in its many and myriad forms...spanning improvements to education to bettering our nation's health to eradicating our plummeting levels of poverty...into a place of more <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">prominence</span> in our country, to garner more <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">participation</span> from the public and the need to shift many of our existing <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">perceptions</span> around service.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=425,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.ck-blog.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/14/dsc01355_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/images/2008/09/14/dsc01355_2.jpg" title="Dsc01355_2" alt="Dsc01355_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
And if we're talking prominence and participation---and most
definitely when we're talking perceptions--we are talking my language. Um, marketing anyone?</strong></p>









<p><strong>#1 Exalt prominence: </strong>As a nation we have plenty to be proud of on service--many don't
realize what a strong nation of volunteers and efforts to improve
social conditions we can boast. But we haven't placed this as prominently as
other departments. Governor Schwarzenegger and wife Maria Shriver have worked hard to get California to appoint a Service Director to its cabinet level--and both McCain and Obama vowed to add this position to their cabinets at the federal levels as well. There are bills dedicated to service that are currently in Congress and ServiceNation unleashed a Declaration of Service that many signed at the event. And of course let us never forget the inimitable dedication to service that our military exemplifies every single day.<br /> </p>

<p><strong>#2 Increase participation levels: </strong>Whether through activism, advocacy or volunteerism, our nation can increase its level of time dedicated to service. Corporations can make it easier for workers to dedicate a portion <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=574,height=627,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.ck-blog.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/14/rosie26hergranddaughter_3.jpg"><img width="200" height="218" border="0" src="http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/images/2008/09/14/rosie26hergranddaughter_3.jpg" title="Rosie26hergranddaughter_3" alt="Rosie26hergranddaughter_3" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
of their time to charities. Individuals can learn how to spend a few less hours watching TV and instead teach a child or an adult to read. As marketers we can lend a few spare hours a month to helping a charity with their promotional needs. Point is, we can get creative, and dedicating time to service can be both impactful and tenable amid busy schedules.</p>

<p><strong>#3 Shift current perceptions:</strong> Obama hit on how we &quot;need to make service cool again&quot; and Schwarzenegger hit on how we need to &quot;leave a space open on our resumes for service,&quot; while Bon Jovi wants to &quot;make service the new black, always in high fashion.&quot; The thing is, we need to shift perceptions around (1) how much service improves our country and its citizens and (2) whom all can dedicate time to service. Remember, while the young have unparalleled levels of energy, older segments have unprecedented wisdom that can only be gained through experience--with retirees having more time they can allot to important causes (I will talk more on this later as, just like AARP underscored, we need to stop viewing the 50+ segment as a deficit when, in fact, they will likely be our biggest asset).<br /> </p>

<p>In closing, I would be remiss if I did not extend my gratitude to three entities: </p>

<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=425,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.ck-blog.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/14/dsc01366_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.ck-blog.com/cks_blog/images/2008/09/14/dsc01366_2.jpg" title="Dsc01366_2" alt="Dsc01366_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>

First, to <a href="http://www.bethechangeinc.org/servicenation/summit/schedule">ServiceNation</a>: </strong>The event itself--and the overall movement--is a marketing
brainchild. BRAVO! There are many organizations dedicated to improving the country's many issues and pushing for social change so to nestle them all under &quot;service&quot; was clever. What's more? ServiceNation is only about 18 month's
old, which makes their tireless efforts all the more impressive.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

<p><strong>
Second, to <a href="http://www.echoditto.com/">Echo Ditto</a>:</strong> I am beyond impressed at how professional and respectful the EchoDigital Team were to we bloggers (big props to <a href="http://thinkingaboutmedia.com/">Brian Reich</a> and <a href="http://www.josephporcelli.com/">Joseph Porcelli</a>). They ensured we were well communicated to and had proper accommodations. So much so that, as a professional, I would have no reservations about recommending them to my clients who need help in bolstering communications and communities around their special events.</p>

<p><strong>Third, to <a href="http://www.social-marketing.com/blog/">Nedra Kline Weinreich</a>:</strong> Nedra is both teacher and friend to me. She not only provided me the reference to attend the event, Nedra helps me every day. She's taken the time to teach me new strategies and methods on social marketing (which is NOT the same thing as social media--read more <a href="http://www.mpdailyfix.com/2007/01/colonoscopies_are_not_colas_so.html">here</a>). I find that teaching is one of the most giving things we can do for another person; in this case it's a huge act of service in bettering our profession. </p>

<p><strong>PS: </strong>Yes, those are pictures from speakers at the event. I needed to take shots of the large screens as I wasn't close enough to the stage to get clearer pictures (and Schwarzenegger attended via video feed). I hope it's OK that I placed photos of the big names in this post...as I said in my opening, it's just not every day that I'm in the company of 500 of them. </p></div>
