			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists at Toshiba&#8217;s Corporate Research and Development Center, in Japan have developed a system that offers shoppers advice on what to buy based on the product barcode and the current weblog buzz around the gadget. The team describes the system WOM Scouter this month in the International Journal of Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been at the mall hoping to choose, the latest mp3 player, camera, high-definition TV, you know how confusing the huge array of choice can be. You only have the sales assistant&#8217;s word for whether a particular brand or model has a good reputation. Checking each and every model while in the store would be almost impossible, without a lot of mobile web browsing and manually entering model numbers into search engines.</p>
<p>Now, Takahiron Kawamura and colleagues have developed WOM (word-of-mouth) Scouter to allow shoppers to get the latest reviews for a product they are looking to buy simply while they are in store. The process involves taking a photo of the item&#8217;s barcode with a cell phone camera. The WOM Scouter then looks up the item&#8217;s meta data via the internet and gathers information from blogs and websites that review the product.</p>
<p>The WOM Scouter than uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze what blogs it collated are saying about the product and provides a straightforward positive or negative opinion on the product&#8217;s reputation. Even the most confused shopper can make an informed decision on that basis, knowing that the blogosphere will support their choice.</p>
<p>The Toshiba team has tested WOM Scouter in a consumer electronics store and in a book store and suggest that the system represents a case of semantics used to provide an instant benefit in a mobile computing environment. In essence, WOM Scouter is one of the first web 3.0 applications that utilises the fundamentals of the original web connectivity, the social media aspects of web 2.0, and provides a service based on the meaning, or semantics, of the data it handles.</p>
<p>WOM Scouter could be adapted not only to improve the shopping experience, but to help in choosing a movie to see, a restaurant at which to eat, or potentially whether or not to accept a job offer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fully automated process is set to improve the production of artificial tissue: medical scientists can perform transplants with skin produced in the laboratory. This tissue is also suitable for testing chemicals at a low cost without requiring animal experiments.</p>
<p>Some patients wish they had a second skin - for instance because their own skin has been burnt in a severe accident. But transplanting skin is a painstaking task, and a transplant that has to cover large areas often requires several operations. Medical scientists have therefore been trying for a long time to grow artificial tissue. This &#8220;artificial skin&#8221; would allow them to treat these patients better and faster.</p>
<p>Tissue engineering has been at the focus of research for many years, and tissues such as cartilage or skin are already being cultured in numerous biotechnology laboratories. But the researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Stuttgart plan to go a step further than that. They are aiming to enable fully automated tissue production. &#8220;Until now, methods of culturing tissue like that used for skin transplants have been very expensive,&#8221; says IGB head of department Professor Heike Mertsching. &#8220;Most of the steps are carried out manually, which means that the process is not particularly efficient.&#8221; The researchers have therefore elaborated a novel conceptual design in collaboration with colleagues from the Fraunhofer Institutes for Production Technology IPT, Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA, and Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI.</p>
<p>First of all, a biopsy - that is, a sample of human tissue - is checked for sterility. A gripper arm then transports the biopsy into the automated device where the individual steps are performed: The machine cuts the biopsy into small pieces, isolates the different cell types, stimulates their growth, and mixes the skin cells with collagen. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the different skin layers is produced with the aid of a special gel matrix - and the skin is ready. In the final step, the machine packages the cells for shipment. Alternatively, the tissue can be cryopreserved - that is, deep-frozen and stored for later use. &#8220;It was important for us that the entire mechanical process is divided into separate modules,&#8221; says Mertsching. &#8220;This enables us to replace or modify individual modules, depending what is needed for the production of different tissue types.&#8221; The method opens up almost unlimited new possibilities for the medical scientists. One of their upcoming projects is to produce intestinal tissue for resorption tests.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern day concentrations of ground level ozone pollution are decreasing the growth of trees in the northern and temperate mid-latitudes, as shown in a paper publishing today in Global Change Biology. Tree growth, measured in biomass, is already 7% less than the late 1800s, and this is set to increase to a 17% reduction by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Ozone pollution is four times greater now than prior to the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s; if modern dependence on fossil fuels continues at the current pace, future ozone concentrations will be at least double current levels by the end of this century with the capacity to further decrease the growth of trees.</p>
<p>The study is the first statistical summary of individual experimental measurements of how ozone will damage the productivity of trees, including data from 263 peer-reviewed scientific publications.</p>
<p>Ozone is the third strongest greenhouse gas, directly contributing to global warming, and is the air pollutant considered to be the most damaging to plants. But more importantly, it has the potential to leave more carbon dioxide, ranked as the first strongest greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere by decreasing carbon assimilation in trees. Ozone pollution occurs when nitrogen oxides have a photochemical reaction with volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;This research quantifies the mean response of trees to ozone pollution measured in terms of total tree biomass, and all component parts such as leaf, root and shoot, lost due to ozone pollution,&#8221; said Dr. Victoria Wittig, lead author of the study. &#8220;Looking at how ozone pollution affects trees is important because of the indirect impact on carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere which will further enhance global warming, in addition to ozone&#8217;s already potent direct impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to ozone pollution reducing the strength of trees to hold carbon in the northern temperate mid-latitudes by reducing tree growth, the research also indicates that broad-leaf trees, such as poplars, are more sensitive to ozone pollution than conifers, such as pines, and that root growth is suppressed more than aboveground growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond the consequences for global warming, the study also infers that in mixed forests conifers will be favored over broad-leaved trees, and that the decrease in root size will increase the vulnerability to storms,&#8221; said Wittig.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plastic that conducts electricity and metal that weighs no more than a feather? It sounds like an upside-down world. Yet researchers have succeeded in making plastics conductive and cutting production costs at the same time.</p>
<p>You could hardly find greater contrasts in one and the same team. Plastic is light and inexpensive, but insulates electric current. Metal is resilient and conducts electricity, but it is also expensive and heavy. Up to now, it has not been possible to combine the properties of these two materials. The IFAM in Bremen has devised a solution that combines the best of both worlds without requiring new machinery to process the components. The greatest challenge for the researchers was getting the plastic to conduct electricity, for plastic-metal hybrids are to be used in the very places where plastic components are equipped with printed circuit boards, for instance in cars or aircraft. Until now, this was only possible via the roundabout route of punching and bending metal sheets in an elaborate process in order to integrate them in a component.</p>
<p>The new solution is simpler: a composite material. The different materials are not merely slotted together or bonded, but mixed in a special process to form a single material. This process produces a homogeneous and fine-meshed electrically conductive network. The composite possesses the desired chemical stability and low weight, coupled with the electrical and thermal conductivity of metals. As it will no longer be necessary in future to integrate metal circuit boards and the components will soon be able to be produced in a single work step, the production costs and the weight of the material are drastically reduced.</p>
<p>Automobile and aircraft manufacturers, in particular, will benefit from this development. The headlamp housings on a car, for example, are made of plastic. Until now, punched metal sheets have been installed in order to illuminate the headlamps. If the housings were fitted with circuit boards made of the conductive plastic-metal hybrids, they could be produced more efficiently and at lower cost than ever before. Many components of an aircraft, such as the fuselage, are partly made of carbon fiber composites (CFC). However, they lack the ability to conduct electricity. A stroke of lightning would have fatal consequences. A plastic-metal hybrid would be a good alternative for discharge structures on components.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of researchers led by Princeton University scientists has found for the first time that tropical rainforests, a vital part of the Earth&#8217;s ecosystem, rely on the rare trace element molybdenum to capture the nitrogen fertilizer needed to support their wildly productive growth.  Most of the nitrogen that supports the rapid, lush growth of rainforests comes from tiny bacteria that can turn nitrogen in the air into fertilizer in the soil.</p>
<p>Until now, scientists had thought that phosphorus was the key element supporting the prodigious expansion of rainforests, according to Lars Hedin, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University who led the research. But an experiment testing the effects of various elements on test plots in lowland rainforests on the Gigante Peninsula in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument in Panama showed that areas treated with molybdenum withdrew more nitrogen from the atmosphere than other elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised,&#8221; said Hedin, who is also a professor in the Princeton Environmental Institute. &#8220;It&#8217;s not what we were expecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, detailed in the Dec. 7 online edition of Nature Geoscience, will be the journal&#8217;s cover story in its print edition.</p>
<p>Molybdenum, the team found, is essential for controlling the biological conversion of nitrogen in the atmosphere into natural soil nitrogen fertilizer, which in turn spurs plant growth. &#8220;Just like trace amounts of vitamins are essential for human health, this exceedingly rare trace metal is indispensable for the vital function of tropical rainforests in the larger Earth system,&#8221; Hedin said.  Molybdenum is 10,000 times less abundant than phosphorus and other major nutrients in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>The discovery has implications for global climate change policy, the scientists said. Previously, researchers knew little about rainforests&#8217; capacity to absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. If molybdenum is central to the biochemical processes involved in the uptake of carbon dioxide, then there may be limits to how much carbon that tropical rainforests can absorb.</p>
<p>The biological enzyme, nitrogenase, which converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil fertilizer, feeds on molybdenum, the researchers found. &#8220;Nitrogenase without molybdenum is like a car engine without spark plugs,&#8221; said Alexander Barron, the lead author on the paper, who was a graduate student in Hedin&#8217;s laboratory and earned his Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton in 2007 and who now is working on climate legislation in Congress.</p>
<p>Other authors on the paper from Princeton include: Anne Kraepiel, an associate research scholar in the Department of Chemistry; Nina Wurzburger, a research associate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; and Jean Philippe Bellenger, an associate research scholar in the Princeton Environmental Institute. S. Joseph Wright, who earned his bachelor&#8217;s degree in biology from Princeton in 1974 and now is a staff scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Institute in Panama, is also a contributing author.</p>
<p>Molybdenum, a lustrous, silvery metal, is found in soil, rock and sea water and in a range of enzymes vital to human health. Traces of the element have been found in Japanese swords dating back to the 14th century. In modern times, its high strength, good electrical conductivity and anticorrosive properties have made molybdenum desirable as an element of rocket engines, radiation shields, light bulb filaments and circuit boards.</p>
<p>The research was conducted with support from the National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Smithsonian Scholarly Studies program, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute student fellowship program and the Environmental Protection Agency student fellowship program.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you are sitting in the back of a classroom, daydreaming about the weekend. Then, out of nowhere, the teacher calls upon you to come to the front the room and solve a math problem. In front of everyone. If just reading this scenario has given you sweaty palms and an increased heart rate, you are not alone. Many of us have experienced math anxiety and in a new report in Current Directions in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, University of Chicago psychologist Sian L. Beilock examines some recent research looking at why being stressed about math can result in poor performance in solving problems.</p>
<p>Much of Beilock’s work suggests that working memory is a key component of math anxiety. Working memory (also known as short term memory), helps us to maintain a limited amount of information at one time, just what is necessary to solve the problem at hand. Beilock’s findings suggest that worrying about a situation (such as solving an arithmetic problem in front of a group of people) takes up the working memory that is available for figuring out the math problem.</p>
<p>The type of working memory involved in solving math problems may be affected by the way the problems are presented. When arithmetic problems are written horizontally, more working memory resources related to language are used (solvers usually maintain problem steps by repeating them in their head). However, when problems are written vertically, visuo-spatial (or where things are located) resources of working memory are used. Individuals who solve vertical problems tend to solve them in a way similar to how they solve problems on paper. Beilock wanted to know if stereotype-induced stress (i.e. reminding women of the stereotype that “girls can’t do math”) would result in different results for solving vertical versus horizontal math problems. The findings showed that the women who had been exposed to the negative stereotype performed poorly, although only on the horizontal problems (which rely on verbal working memory). Beilock suggests that the stereotype creates an inner monologue of worries, which relies heavily on verbal working memory. Thus, there is insufficient verbal working memory available to solve the horizontal math problems.</p>
<p>It has generally been shown that the more working memory capacity a person has, the better their performance on academic tasks such as problem solving and reasoning. To further explore this, Beilock and her colleagues compared math test scores in individuals who had higher levels of working memory with those who had less. The subjects took a math test either in a high pressure situation or low pressure situation. It turns out that the subjects with higher working memory levels performed very poorly during the high pressure testing situation—that is, the subjects with the greatest capacity for success were the most likely to “choke under pressure”. Beilock surmises that individuals with higher levels of working memory have superior memory and computational capacity, which they use on a regular basis to excel in the classroom. “However, if these resources are compromised, for example, by worries about the situation and its consequences, high working memory individuals’ advantage disappears,&#8221; Beilock explains.</p>
<p>As more schools start emphasizing state-exam based curricula, these studies will become increasingly relevant and important for the development of exams and training regimens that will ensure optimal performance, especially by the most promising students.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine tiny cracks in your patio table healing by themselves, or the first small scratch on your new car disappearing by itself. This and more may be possible with self-healing coatings being developed at the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>The new coatings are designed to better protect materials from the effects of environmental exposure. Applications range from automotive paints and marine varnishes to the thick, rubbery coatings on patio furniture and park benches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting from our earlier work on self-healing materials at the U. of I., we have now created self-healing coatings that automatically repair themselves and prevent corrosion of the underlying substrate,&#8221; said Paul Braun, a University Scholar and professor of materials science and engineering. Braun is corresponding author of a paper accepted for publication in the journal Advanced Materials, and posted on its Web site.</p>
<p>To make self-repairing coatings, the researchers first encapsulate a catalyst into spheres less than 100 microns in diameter (a micron is 1 millionth of a meter). They also encapsulate a healing agent into similarly sized microcapsules. The microcapsules are then dispersed within the desired coating material and applied to the substrate.</p>
<p>&#8220;By encapsulating both the catalyst and the healing agent, we have created a dual capsule system that can be added to virtually any liquid coating material,&#8221; said Braun, who also is affiliated with the university&#8217;s Beckman Institute, Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory, department of chemistry, and Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory.</p>
<p>When the coating is scratched, some of the capsules break open, spilling their contents into the damaged region. The catalyst and healing agent react, repairing the damage within minutes or hours, depending upon environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The performance of the self-healing coating system was evaluated through corrosion testing of damaged and healed coated steel samples compared to control samples that contained no healing agents in the coating. Reproducible damage was induced by scratching through the 100-micron-thick polymer coating and into the steel substrate using a razor blade. The samples were then immersed in a salt solution and compared over time.</p>
<p>The control samples corroded within 24 hours and exhibited extensive rust formation, most prevalently within the groove of the scratched regions, but also extending across the substrate surface, the researchers report. In dramatic contrast, the self-healing samples showed no visual evidence of corrosion even after 120 hours of exposure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our dual capsule healing system offers a general approach to self-healing coatings that operates across a broad spectrum of coating chemistries,&#8221; Braun said. &#8220;The microcapsule motif also provides a delivery mechanism for corrosion inhibitors, antimicrobial agents, and other functional chemicals.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Measures imposed to reduce exposure to nuts are often based on irrational fears of nut allergies and are becoming increasingly sensationalist, according to a doctor on <a href="http://bmj.com">bmj.com</a>.</p>
<p>A peanut on the floor of a school bus leading to evacuation and decontamination for fear that it might be eaten by the 10 year old passengers, and schools declaring themselves &#8220;nut free&#8221; by banning nuts, peanut butter, homebaked goods and any foods without ingredient labels, are just some examples cited in this article.</p>
<p>According to Professor Nicolas Christakis from Harvard Medical School, there is no evidence that any of these extreme restrictions work better than more circumscribed policies or that they are worth the money and disruptions they create.</p>
<p>In the US, 150 people die each year from food allergies. This is compared to the 50 who die from bee stings, the 100 who die from lightning strikes, the 45,000 who die in motor vehicle accidents, and the 10,000 who are hospitalised for traumatic brain injury from playing sport. But these issues do not incur such extreme reactions, such as calling for an end to sport.</p>
<p>Christakis says that the &#8220;gross over-reaction to the magnitude of the threat&#8221; is very similar to mass psychogenic illness (MPI), previously known as epidemic hysteria.</p>
<p>Often seen occurring in small towns, schools and factories, these outbreaks of MPI involve healthy people in a flow of anxiety, most often triggered by a fear of contamination. Being around individuals who are anxious heightens others&#8217; anxiety.</p>
<p>These extreme measures to reduce exposure to nuts are fuelling anxiety in parents, leading to more sensitisation, and creating the very epidemic they are designed to stop. A recent study has suggested that early exposure to peanuts actually reduces, rather than increases the risk of allergy.</p>
<p>Christakis concludes by calling for a level-headed strategy to deal with this phenomenon before it spirals out of control.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A technology that is adapted to the special conditions for wave energy places the wave energy technology from Uppsala on the absolute cutting edge in the world. In his dissertation, Rafael Waters presents the findings from the experimental facility located in the sea outside Lysekil, Sweden, in which he has played a leading role in designing and constructing. He is publicly defending his dissertation at Uppsala University on December 12.</p>
<p>For nearly three years, a wave power plant has stood on the bottom of the ocean a couple of kilometers off the west coast of Sweden, near Lysekil. Rafael Waters, from the Uppsala University Division of Electricity, designed and built the facility as part of his doctoral project. The station is uniquely durable and maintenance-free thanks to its simple mechanical construction, which was engineered at the Division.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of trying to adapt conventional energy technology to the special challenges of wave energy, we developed a technology that is adapted to the ocean from the start,&#8221; says Rafael Waters.</p>
<p>The generator in the wave power facility in Lysekil is very special. It is a so-called linear generator that generates electricity apace with the slow movements of the waves. An ordinary generator transforms rotation energy to electricity, and it needs to turn at about 1500 rpm to be efficient. It is then necessary somehow to convert the slow wave movement to a rapid rotating movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means that a wave energy station with an ordinary generator needs energy transmission systems such as gearboxes or hydraulic systems and other complicated details that wear out and require much more maintenance than a linear generator,&#8221; says Rafael Waters. &#8220;Our generator has functioned without any trouble every time we started it up over the years, even though it has received no maintenance and has sometimes stood still for months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafael Waters and his colleagues are busy determining parameters such as power output and buoy size in order to attain the best results in the long term.</p>
<p>&#8220;With smaller buoys and lower power output, there is less stress on the wave power station. On the other hand, the goal is to produce as much power as possible. This is ultimately an economic consideration, and we want to understand how to optimize the construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next year the wave power facility in Lysekil will be complemented by two more plants and connected to one of the world&#8217;s first wave energy parks, which will be capable of supplying household electricity to about 60 homes. In a few years&#8217; time, the park will include some ten plants.</p>
<p>In the long term, wave energy should be able to supply Sweden with about 10TWh of electricity per year, comparable to 12 nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>&#8220;But other countries have much more potential,&#8221; says Rafael Waters. &#8220;Norway&#8217;s waves, for instance, contain ten times as much energy as ours, and Norway&#8217;s total potential is more than ten times higher than Sweden&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public opinion surveys report that the small fraction of people who know about nanotechnology have a favorable view of it. This finding has led many to assume that the public at large will respond favorably to nanotechnology applications as popular awareness grows, education expands and commercialization increases.</p>
<p>But the results of an experiment, conducted by the Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School in collaboration with the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) and published Dec. 7 on the Nature Nanotechnology Web site, do not support this &#8220;familiarity hypothesis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The experiment found that how people react to information about nanotechnology depends on cultural predispositions. Exposed to balanced information, people with pro-commerce values tend to see the benefits of nanotechnology as outweighing any risks. However, people with egalitarian or communitarian values who are predisposed to blame commerce and industry for social inequities and environmental harm tend to see nanotechnology risks as outweighing benefits.</p>
<p>The study also found that people who have pro-commerce cultural values are more likely to know about nanotechnology than others. &#8220;Not surprisingly, people who are enthused by technology and believe it can be safe and beneficial tend to learn about new technologies before other people do,&#8221; said Dan Kahan, Professor at Yale Law School and lead author of the Nature Nanotechnology article. &#8220;So while various opinion polls suggest that familiarity with nanotechnology leads people to believe it is safe, they have been confusing cause with effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>The findings of the experiment highlight the need for any nanotechnology information and risk communication strategy to focus on message framing and to take an informed, multi-audience approach, according to PEN experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The message matters. How information about nanotechnology is presented to the vast majority of the public who still know little about it can either make or break this technology,&#8221; says David Rejeski, the director of PEN. &#8220;Scientists, the government and industry generally take a simplistic, &#8216;just the facts&#8217; approach to communicating with the public about a new technology. But this research shows that diverse audiences and groups react to the same information very differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because perfecting the science of nanotechnology risk communication is essential to society&#8217;s realization of the full benefits of nanotechnology itself, PEN experts believe that every major funding initiative directed at the development of nanotechnology and the study of nanotechnology risks should include a risk-communication component.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without investment in understanding how to explain the potential risks, as well as the potential benefits, to the public, significant innovation could be stifled,&#8221; Rejeski adds.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As video sharing Web sites like YouTube continue to grow in popularity, so do challenges around proper labeling of videos and monitoring for copyright infractions.</p>
<p>But one student from the University of Toronto has created a framework that can improve the efficiency of such Web sites and cut down on copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The Tiny Videos system, created by Computer Engineering graduate student Alex Karpenko, is a groundbreaking system that allows extremely large amounts of video data to be compressed and then searched based on content. Essentially, the system can recognize and find duplicate video segments and then properly label them.</p>
<p>&#8220;This system is extremely beneficial for users because it can help them quickly and easily find the specific videos they&#8217;re looking for,&#8221; says Karpenko. &#8220;It&#8217;s also useful for copyright holders because it can identify video clips that violate copyright laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>The system, which was tested using a massive sample of 50,000 videos, has several practical applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>When someone uploads a video to YouTube, they may not label that video properly, which can make it difficult for other users to find. The Tiny Videos system searches uploaded videos for generic characteristics and assigns them a more useful label or tag so users can find videos easily.</li>
<li>Since the Tiny Videos system can quickly search for specific content with large video collections, it can quickly identify videos that violate copyright infringement and alert copyright holders.</li>
<li>The Tiny Videos system can also help users find similar or related coverage. For example, the system could help them identify coverage of the same political event that was aired on CNN, the BBC and CBC.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;This system is truly revolutionary in its ability to improve popular video sharing Web sites for everyone,&#8221; says Parham Aarabi, an associate professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at U of T and Canada Research Chair in Internet Video, Audio, and Image Search, who supervised the creation of the system.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Animal feeding operations are an important emission source of air pollutants including methane and carbon dioxide &#8212; known greenhouse gases. Recent inventories suggest that animal manure makes a significant contribution to global methane emissions. As a consequence, greenhouse gas emissions can potentially become a limiting factor in the development and sustainability of animal production and technologies are needed to mitigate pollutant gas emissions. Oil spray has been used as a mitigation technique to reduce pollution from animal buildings. However, little is known about its effect on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Scientists at Purdue University and the University of Missouri have investigated oil spray on air pollutant emissions from pig barns in northern Missouri. Specifically, they studied the quantity and characteristics of methane and carbon dioxide emissions from two commercial pig finishing barns and tested three oil spray techniques &#8212; vegetable oil sprinkling, essential oil misting, and misting of essential oil with water &#8212; to reduce these emissions. Results from the study were published in the November-December issue of Journal of Environmental Quality.</p>
<p>The study revealed average emissions of 32.5 g methane and 15.8 g carbon dioxide per day per animal unit (500 kg animal live weight) from the two barns. Treatments of oil sprinkling, misting of essential oils, and misting of essential oils with water reduced the average emissions of methane by 20% and of carbon dioxide by 19%. Barn methane and carbon dioxide concentrations and emission rates were affected by diel and seasonal fluctuations of ambient temperature. Methane was produced from decomposing manure and released from recycled lagoon effluent during barn gutter flushing. Carbon dioxide was produced from pig exhalation, manure decomposition, and combustion heaters and was also released from recycled lagoon effluent. The flushing lagoon effluent was responsible for 9.8 % of methane and 4.1 % of carbon dioxide in the total barn emissions.</p>
<p>A state-of-the-art mobile laboratory monitoring system was set up between two barns and connected to the barns via tubing and cables. One barn was used as control and another was treated with the three oil spray techniques, one after another for a total of 247 days. Air samples were taken at the exhaust fans of the two barns and from outdoor background and pumped into the mobile laboratory via tubing. Concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide in the sample air were measured continuously with two gas analyzers. Air sampling and measurement were conducted 18 times daily to cover diel variations. Ventilation fans were monitored for gas emission calculations. Barn temperature, relative humidity, animal activity, barn space heaters, manure flushing, and weather conditions were also continuously monitored. The field investigation was conducted from August 2002 to July 2003 to cover seasonal variations.</p>
<p>Quantification and mitigation of air pollution from animal feeding operations helps researchers to understand and reduce the industry’s negative impact on local and global environments. Research on greenhouse gases and other pollutants emissions from animal barns of different animal species is ongoing at Purdue University in collaboration with other universities in the U.S. Mitigation technology development will be one of the research focuses in this field. Further study on oil spray in animal barns is needed to optimize its application method for better effects on reducing emissions of not only greenhouse gases but also particulate matter and odor.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though effective treatments are available for individuals suffering from chronic depression and anxiety, very little is known about how often these treatments are used or how prevalent these conditions are among the nation&#8217;s general population.</p>
<p>But in a first-of-its-kind study, UCLA researchers have developed estimates for both the prevalence of chronic psychiatric illness in the general population and how often individuals suffering from such illnesses receive appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>In the study, published in the December issue of the peer-reviewed journal Psychiatric Services and currently available online, researchers found that approximately 4.7 percent of the nation&#8217;s population suffers from persistent depression or anxiety disorders, with a minority of those afflicted receiving adequate medication or counseling.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a policy perspective, this study indicates that we have to do much better in terms of helping people in the population and clinicians in primary care,&#8221; said lead author Dr. Alexander S. Young, a UCLA professor of psychiatry and director of health services for the Department of Veterans Affairs Desert Pacific Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC). &#8220;We need to understand that psychiatric disorders are treatable with psychotherapy and/or medication. Patients would benefit if we improved linkages between primary care and specialty mental health care so that patients are referred and accept referrals to mental health specialists, especially when they are chronically ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, we have to improve insurance arrangements so that they encourage more intensive treatment in people who remain ill,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study was based on data from Healthcare for Communities, a nationally representative household survey of adults in the United States. The researchers analyzed responses from 1,642 adults with major depression or anxiety disorders. These surveys, conducted in 1997 and 1998, with follow-ups approximately two-and-a-half years later, assessed diagnosis, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, medical conditions, suicidal thoughts, insurance, and the use of medications and counseling.</p>
<p>At follow-up, the researchers found that 59 percent of the individuals no longer met the criteria for having a psychiatric disorder. But to their surprise, they found that among those who remained ill, there were only modest increases in medication use and no statistically significant increase in the use of counseling for their disorders — measures that are known to significantly improve outcomes, especially when used in combination. Among this subgroup:</p>
<ul>
<li>87 percent had a chronic, co-morbid medical disorder.</li>
<li>In the prior year, 88 percent had seen a primary care practitioner, but only 22 percent had consulted a mental health specialist.</li>
<li>In the two-and-a-half years between baseline and follow-up, use of medication rose from 21 percent to 29 percent, and use of counseling fell from 23 percent to 19 percent.</li>
<li>Only 12 percent with persistent illness were getting both medication and counseling (the appropriate treatment in this situation).</li>
<li>51 percent had suicidal thoughts at follow-up.</li>
<li>Men and those with less education received less treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Persistent depressive and anxiety disorders are remarkably common in the U.S. population and are associated with substantial morbidity. There are significant problems with the quality of care received by this population, and these problems persist over time,&#8221; the researchers concluded. &#8220;In the population with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders, increasing the rate of appropriate care from its current low level could result in substantial improvement in individuals&#8217; lives.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The decline of the Roman and Byzantine Empires in the Eastern Mediterranean more than 1,400 years ago may have been driven by unfavorable climate changes.</p>
<p>Based on chemical signatures in a piece of calcite from a cave near Jerusalem, a team of American and Israeli geologists pieced together a detailed record of the area&#8217;s climate from roughly 200 B.C. to 1100 A.D. Their analysis, to be reported in an upcoming issue of the journal Quaternary Research, reveals increasingly dry weather from 100 A.D. to 700 A.D. that coincided with the fall of both Roman and Byzantine rule in the region.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by University of Wisconsin-Madison geology graduate student Ian Orland and professor John Valley, reconstructed the high-resolution climate record based on geochemical analysis of a stalagmite from Soreq Cave, located in the Stalactite Cave Nature Reserve near Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks sort of like tree rings in cross-section. You have many concentric rings and you can analyze across these rings, but instead of looking at the ring widths, we&#8217;re looking at the geochemical composition of each ring,&#8221; says Orland.</p>
<p>Using oxygen isotope signatures and impurities &#8212; such as organic matter flushed into the cave by surface rain &#8212; trapped in the layered mineral deposits, Orland determined annual rainfall levels for the years the stalagmite was growing, from approximately 200 B.C. to 1100 A.D.</p>
<p>While cave formations have previously been used as climate indicators, past analyses have relied on relatively crude sampling tools, typically small dental drills, which required averaging across 10 or even 100 years at a time. The current analysis used an advanced ion microprobe in the Wisconsin Secondary-Ion Mass-Spectrometer (Wisc-SIMS) laboratory to sample spots just one-hundredth of a millimeter across. That represents about 100 times sharper detail than previous methods. With such fine resolution, the scientists were able to discriminate weather patterns from individual years and seasons.</p>
<p>Their detailed climate record shows that the Eastern Mediterranean became drier between 100 A.D. and 700 A.D., a time when Roman and Byzantine power in the region waned, including steep drops in precipitation around 100 A.D. and 400 A.D. &#8220;Whether this is what weakened the Byzantines or not isn&#8217;t known, but it is an interesting correlation,&#8221; Valley says. &#8220;These things were certainly going on at the time that those historic changes occurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team is now applying the same techniques to older samples from the same cave. &#8220;One period of interest is the last glacial termination, around 19,000 years ago &#8212; the most recent period in Earth&#8217;s history when the whole globe experienced a warming of 4 to 5 degrees Celsius,&#8221; Orland says.</p>
<p>Formations from this period of rapid change may help them better understand how weather patterns respond to quickly warming temperatures.</p>
<p>Soreq Cave &#8212; at least 185,000 years old and still active &#8212; also offers the hope of creating a high-resolution long-term climate change record to parallel those generated from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one knows what happened on the continents… At the poles, the climate might have been quite different,&#8221; says Valley. &#8220;This is a record of what was going on in a very different part of the world.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A method of producing synthetic bone, using techniques normally used to make catalytic converters for cars, is being developed by researchers at WMG at the University of Warwick.</p>
<p>The team is now working closely with Warwick Ventures, the University&#8217;s technology transfer office, to find a suitable partner to help commercialise the technology, and will be presenting their work on 9 December at the national university technology showcase event, Bioversity.</p>
<p>WMG&#8217;s Dr. Kajal Mallick is developing the technique along with his postgraduate researcher James Meredith. They strongly believe it could offer substantial clinical benefits to patients undergoing bone implant surgery.</p>
<p>The technique involves state-of-the-art extrusion of the implant material through a mould, to produce a 3-dimensional honeycomb texture, with uniform pores throughout. The material can then be sculpted by the surgeon to precisely match the defect. After implantation bone cells will be transported into the implant and begin to form new bone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We worked with a Japanese company which manufactures catalytic converters and used their facility to produce samples which we could then test in the laboratory,&#8221; explains Dr. Mallick.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that we were able to use calcium phosphates &#8212; a family of bioceramics that are routinely used in bone implant operations, but by using this technique we were able to improve significantly both the strength and porosity of the implant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Mallick added: &#8220;At the present time, there is no product available in the market place that satisfies both these key properties simultaneously. It is nearly an ideal scaffold structure for efficient blood flow and formation of new bone cells.&#8221;</p>
<p>The increased strength of the material means it could be used in spinal surgery, or in revision hip and knee operations, where currently non-degradable materials such as titanium or steel may be used. The advantage of increased and interconnected porosity is that the implant can quickly be filled with blood vessels, resulting in a more rapid healing process.</p>
<p>James Meredith is working to complete an Engineering Doctorate in this research area. He says: &#8220;The synthetic bone we are developing is as strong as normal healthy bone yet porous enough to allow bone cells to inhabit it and generate new bone. Over a period of time, we expect the synthetic bone will resorb, leaving only natural bone. I hope that if we can find an industrial partner to take this to market, we will enable treatment of conditions which up to this point have only been possible using metal replacement parts or low strength foam-like bone substitutes&#8221;</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s research is being presented on 9 December at Bioversity 2008, a national university technology showcase event. Bioversity is part of the biotechnology conference, Genesis 2008, organised by The London Biotechnology Network.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many computing luminaries, such as Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, have an early experience in common &#8212; an engaging experience in middle school or high school that sparked an excitement for learning everything they could about computers. Today, many young people are surrounded by computing at home and in school, and some of them will likely find a similar passion that will lead them to push tomorrow&#8217;s frontiers in computer science.</p>
<p>For visually impaired students, however, the pathways to studying computer science are more complicated. While technologies can make it easier for them to use computers, the visual nature of modern computing makes it difficult for them to participate in programming courses and other types of computing instruction. These students also commonly lack the resources and preparation other students get in computing before they get to college, and there is a dearth of visually impaired role models in computing to inspire them as they pursue their degrees.</p>
<p>Enter Project Accessible Computing Education (ACE), an NSF-funded initiative at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The project is designed to help prepare visually impaired middle school and high school students participate in computer science programs at the collegiate level. Project ACE&#8217;s ultimate goal is to increase the number of visually impaired students pursuing degrees in computer science and give them the foundations they need to be fully successful in their studies and beyond.</p>
<p>According to Stephanie Ludi, a professor of software engineering at RIT and the principal investigator for the project, in the long run, encouraging these students will benefit everyone who uses a computer. &#8220;Because of the unique perspective they have,&#8221; Ludi said in an interview this month, &#8220;they can create software that is really more usable for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project is focused on three areas: better preparation for visually impaired students before college, support for these students as they face challenges in computing that other students do not, and educating teachers in how to best help these students learn and achieve.</p>
<p>Last year, the project conducted an interactive workshop for visually impaired students and their parents called ImagineIT. The four-day workshop, held at RIT&#8217;s B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, brought together more than a dozen visually impaired students and their parents from around the country and gave them an opportunity to tackle &#8220;real world&#8221; computing applications and learn about career opportunities in computing. The students worked collaboratively on a number of challenges, including building and programming Lego Mindstorm robots to interact with the environment by navigating through a maze to find a sound source.</p>
<p>According to Thomas Reichlmayr, also a professor of professors of software engineering at RIT and co-principal investigator on the project, the workshop was helpful for everyone. &#8220;It was a good opportunity for the students,&#8221; Reichlmayr said, &#8220;but also for their parents to network with other parents, to share experiences with their school districts and their own experiences as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to helping these young programmers gain a better appreciation for computer science, Project ACE also used the experience as a foundation for future workshops centered on preparing teachers to work with these students. Educators and students alike can go to <a href="http://www.se.rit.edu/~imagine-it/">the project&#8217;s Web site</a> and find lesson plans, tutorials, and other resources.</p>
<p>Ludi says that Project ACE will repeat the ImagineIT workshop next year at RIT and also in Southern California.</p>
<p>In the next few years, the students from the first ImagineIT workshop will enter college. According to Ludi, some of them have already expressed interest in majoring in computer science.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age of the petabyte, we all need help digesting and understanding massive amounts of information. In this month&#8217;s Physics World, a series of features celebrates the ascendance of visual methods that are being used to make meaning of the mountains of scientific data.</p>
<p>Scientific visualizations can play a key role in fundamental physics, particularly when it comes to depicting the outcome of particle collisions at CERN&#8217;s massive new Large Hadron Collider, but they can also shed light on much more everyday research.</p>
<p>A feature written by Cesar A Hidalgo, a physicist at the Centre for International Development, Harvard University, US, explains why &#8216;network science&#8217; could be a useful tool in both national economic planning and in medical research.</p>
<p>In medical research, a database of medical records from a large population of elderly US citizens has been used to build a &#8216;disease network&#8217; to show how various disease associations are distributed and, among other things, alert doctors to health risks closely associated to any particular ailment.</p>
<p>A similar project, called the Product Space produced in collaboration with a team of economists, maps out the kind of tradeable products that tend to emerge together in national economies and highlights areas where economies may have great difficulty diversifying.</p>
<p>On providing easily understandable information that deals with very complex subjects, Barry Sanders, iCORE chair of quantum information science and director of the Institute for Quantum Information Science at the University of Calgary, Canada, writes about the work he has undertaken with a team of researchers and animators to produce a &#8220;movie&#8221; that explains how quantum computers work, Solid state quantum computer in silicon.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the need to delicately balance scientific accuracy and aesthetic appeal, Sanders writes, &#8220;Visualization of scientific knowledge is not easy or cheap, but it is rewarding and useful. Animated films are valuable tools for explaining difficult, abstract concepts such as quantum computing in the classroom.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of scientists from across Europe are embarking on new research to develop a treatment for food allergy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Food allergy affects around 10 million EU citizens and there is no cure,&#8221; says Dr Clare Mills of the Institute of Food Research, a lead partner in the Food Allergy Specific Therapy (FAST) research project. &#8220;All people with food allergy can do is avoid the foods to which they are allergic. The threat of severe anaphylaxis has a great impact on their quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attempted treatment with allergen-specific immunotherapy, where a patient received monthly injections with an allergen extract for three to five years, failed because it could cause anaphylaxis as a side effect.</p>
<p>Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction involving the whole body, often within minutes of exposure to the allergen. Peanut allergy is the most widely known cause, but other causes of anaphylaxis include other foods, insect stings, latex and drugs. If untreated in time it can be fatal.</p>
<p>In the FAST project, scientists will use modified variants of allergic proteins that are hypoallergenic and therefore safer. The proteins will be purified making them more effective and making it easier to control the dose.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of all food allergies are caused by about 10 foods. Allergies to fish and fruit are among the most common in Europe. In fish allergy the protein responsible is parvalbumin and in fruit it is lipid transfer protein (LTP). Modified hypo-allergenic versions of these proteins will be produced at tested as potential treatments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hoping for a cure that will allow people to eat fish or fruit again,&#8221; says Dr Ronald van Ree from the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam. &#8220;But a significant reduction of sensitivity would already be a great step forwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk of unintentional exposure due to cross-contamination of foods, or while eating in restaurants or at parties, will decrease. This will take away lot of the anxiety that has a negative impact on the quality of life of food allergy sufferers.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first comprehensive &#8220;inventory&#8221; of sea and land animals around a group of Antarctic islands reveals a region that is rich in biodiversity and has more species than the Galapagos. The study provides an important benchmark to monitor how they will respond to future environmental change.</p>
<p>Reporting this week in the Journal of Biogeography, the team from British Antarctic Survey and University of Hamburg, describe how they combed the land, sea and shores of the South Orkney Islands, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, using scuba divers and trawled nets to catch creatures as deep as 1500 metres.</p>
<p>Animals recorded were then checked with a century of literature and modern databases and the team concludes there are over 1200 known marine and land species. These include sea urchins, free-swimming worms, crustaceans and molluscs, mites and birds. Five were new to science.</p>
<p>Lead author Dr David Barnes from British Antarctic Survey (BAS) says: &#8220;This is the first time anybody has done an inventory like this in the polar regions. It&#8217;s part of the Census of Marine Life (COML) &#8212; an international effort to assess and explain the diversity and distribution of marine life in the world&#8217;s oceans. If we are to understand how these animals will respond to future change, a starting point like this is really important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Author Stefanie Kaiser from University of Hamburg says: &#8220;We never knew there were so many different species on and around these islands. This abundance of life was completely unexpected for a location in the polar regions, previously perceived to be poor in biodiversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research team, consisting of 23 scientists from five research institutes, spent seven weeks on the BAS Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross in 2006.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although naturally occurring smallpox was eradicated in 1977, there is concern that bioterrorists might obtain smallpox from a laboratory and release it into the population. Under such circumstances, the supply of smallpox vaccine may be insufficient for universal administration. In a study published in the December 2008 issue of The American Journal of Medicine, researchers found that lifetime protection is obtained from just one vaccination, even when that vaccination occurred as much as 88 years ago. They conclude that in the event of a smallpox bioterrorist attack, vaccinia smallpox vaccine should be used first on individuals who have not been vaccinated previously.</p>
<p>Examining 246 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, investigators from the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health found permanent immunity was conferred by vaccination or by survival from an active smallpox infection. In the sample, 209 subjects were vaccinated one or more times 13 to 88 years prior to the study; an additional 18 had had childhood smallpox, and 29 with no history of vaccination or smallpox were included.</p>
<p>Although the vaccinia virus vaccine was used since the late 18th century, routine vaccination was discontinued more than 30 years ago in many countries. Most Americans under 35 have never been vaccinated and most over 35 have not received booster immunizations since the early 1970s. If a bioterrorist attack were to occur, it would be critical to know who already had effective immunity and would not need to be vaccinated, leaving another dose available for someone else.</p>
<p>Current recommendations relating to smallpox vaccination has been that people with repeated exposure to smallpox, for example travelers to endemic areas, should be revaccinated every five years. This study suggests that such reimmunizations may not be necessary because multiple vaccinations achieve only marginally higher levels of antibody and virus neutralizing activity than single vaccination.</p>
<p>Writing in the article, Dan L. Longo, MD, National Institute on Aging, states &#8220;A major question posed today is whether those individuals vaccinated 40 or more years ago would be protected in the event of smallpox exposure. This may be a critical question because the availability of smallpox vaccines is limited and currently inadequate for a mass inoculation program. We found that vaccinated subjects maintain what appear to be protective levels of neutralizing antibodies to vaccinia indefinitely and do not require booster vaccinations even if they are many decades removed from primary vaccination. These data imply that limited supplies of vaccine can be more usefully applied to individuals who have never been vaccinated, primarily individuals born after 1972.&#8221;</p>
