    <content type="html">Last month, we asked for your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=38342147130&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; in choosing the next great Facebook Platform applications. Thanks to those of you who tested the applications and contributed, over 180,000 votes were cast.  We&apos;ve narrowed down over 600 developers who applied for &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.facebook.com/fbFund.php&quot;&gt;fbFund&lt;/a&gt;—Facebook&apos;s program to award grants to talented entrepreneurs who build applications that help you share, connect and discover on Facebook.  And today, we&apos;re happy to announce the five grand prize winners and recipients of $250,000 each to put towards developing more meaningful applications for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We hope you&apos;ll take a minute to check out each of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Celebrate a special occasion by organizing your friends on Facebook to sign a &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.facebook.com/groupcards/&quot;&gt;Groupcard&lt;/a&gt;—even if they&apos;re scattered, you can still rally everyone together to send an online card with messages, photos and music.  Your card can be both online and off--with an option to print and deliver it in person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Compete with friends in the social game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.facebook.com/mousehunt&quot;&gt;MouseHunt&lt;/a&gt;.  Trap mice invading your kingdom as you vie to be the best mousehunter, and be sure to collect cheese along the way for more bait.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
If you&apos;re in the exciting process of planning your wedding, &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.facebook.com/wedsnap_wedding/start.php&quot;&gt;Weddingbook&lt;/a&gt; can help you prepare for the big day, as well as find advice and support. You can interact with and introduce guests, countdown to your event, share photos and keep friends and family updated on plans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And if you&apos;re trying to promote your business, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimeo.com/2162983&quot;&gt;Wildfire&lt;/a&gt; to create contests, sweepstakes and giveaways on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;

These are just a few of the thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/applications/&quot;&gt;applications&lt;/a&gt; available on Facebook with many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html">Some of Facebook&apos;s fastest growth this past year has come in European countries.  Our roster of active users now includes many millions of people in Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Germany—and in fact all 45 countries of Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&apos;ve been building Facebook&apos;s physical presence in Europe as well, adding people to our London office all year and announcing in October that we will open our European operations headquarters in Dublin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today, I&apos;m happy to announce our first employee in France, Damien Vincent.  Over the next few months, Damien will be building a sales team in Paris in recognition of the increasing desire by companies in France and nearby countries to make advertising on Facebook a part of their growth strategy.  Companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Peugeot/7983063204?ref=s&quot;&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/dell#/dell?ref=s&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; already have Facebook ad campaigns running in France, helping people discover new products, explore ideas and share with their friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Facebook en Francais has its own flavor, we also embody the global connectedness of Facebook.  Our average French user has 72 friends, of which more than a dozen live in other European countries, the United States or additional international locations.  We feel more closely connected to friends all over the world because of Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Blake Chandlee, Facebook&apos;s Commercial Director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, can&apos;t wait to meet more annonceurs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier this fall, Drew and Sierra of Washington state suffered every parent&apos;s worst nightmare when they learned that their 13-year-old son, Levi, had collapsed and gone into cardiac arrest during his gym class.     Fortunately, Levi&apos;s school had a defibrillator (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator&quot;&gt;AED&lt;/a&gt;) that teachers used to keep him alive until he could be airlifted to the hospital.  Still, his chances of survival were slim as his heart had stopped for 30 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With their son in critical condition, Drew and Sierra reached out to their friends and relatives for support.  From the hospital, Drew updated his Facebook status with news of the incident and Levi&apos;s progress.  &quot;Within moments, I had people responding,&quot; he told us, &quot;Not just locally, but even friends in Germany and as far as Australia!&quot;  Over the next two weeks, as Levi&apos;s condition improved, Drew continued using his status to broadcast the latest news from doctors to friends and relatives on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Friends and family continued to reach out to ask about Levi and offer any help they could.  Drew created a Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/grouphome.php&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; for Levi, which more than a hundred of his friends, family and classmates joined to stay updated on his situation.  As with any &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=443&quot;&gt;Wall&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, people started posting their thoughts, which Drew compared to a &quot;prayer chain.&quot;  Drew added photos of Levi and recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.komonews.com/news/34311919.html&quot;&gt;news articles&lt;/a&gt; telling the story of his son&apos;s incredible rescue and recovery. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, Levi is out of the hospital and back at school, grateful to the friends and family who supported him.  His parents plan to shift the focus of Levi&apos;s support group to raise awareness about the machine (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator&quot;&gt;AED&lt;/a&gt;) that saved their son&apos;s life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nikki, an Analyst in User Operations, just joined a group supporting the adoption of defibrillators in schools.&lt;/i&gt;</content>

    <summary>Since we launched video last year, more than 45 million videos have been uploaded to Facebook with approximately 100,000 new videos added each day.  Starting today, you&apos;ll be able to upload higher quality videos to Facebook and also embed your Facebook videos on other websites.</summary>
    <content type="html">Since we &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2500237130&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; video last year, more than 45 million &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/video/?ref=sb&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; have been uploaded to Facebook with approximately 100,000 new videos added each day.  Starting today, you&apos;ll be able to upload higher quality videos to Facebook and also embed your Facebook videos on other websites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Higher quality video means we&apos;ll be supporting higher resolutions—as much as 1280 by 720 pixels (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p&quot;&gt;720p&lt;/a&gt;)—which means crisper quality than was previously possible on Facebook. Plus, we&apos;ve upgraded our audio, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you don&apos;t own a HD camera or you don&apos;t actively upload videos to Facebook, you&apos;ll still be able to enjoy higher quality videos all over the site.  This means movie studios, bands and anyone else that uploads videos to Facebook will be able to provide you with a better viewing experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 6&gt;You&apos;ll also be able to take videos you&apos;ve added to Facebook and embed them on other websites.  If you have a blog, personal or business website, you&apos;ll be able to display any of your Facebook videos on that site as well.  We&apos;re making it easy for you to share your videos across the web with the same privacy settings you have on Facebook, which means that if the privacy is set to &quot;Everyone&quot;, people won&apos;t have to be logged into Facebook to view it.  Or if you want only a few friends to view your video, you can control that through your Facebook privacy settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New and improved video on Facebook, now in high definition (view in full-screen mode by selecting the icon on the lower right):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; &gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/v/1068574267598&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/v/1068574267598&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <summary>Over the summer we announced an extension of Facebook Platform called Facebook Connect.   Facebook Connect makes it easier for you to take your online identity with you all over the Web, share what you do online with your friends and stay updated on what they&apos;re doing.</summary>
    <content type="html">Over the summer we &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=24577977130&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an extension of Facebook Platform called Facebook Connect.   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=730&quot;&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier for you to take your online identity with you all over the Web, share what you do online with your friends and stay updated on what they&apos;re doing.  You won&apos;t have to create separate accounts for every website, just use your Facebook login wherever Connect is available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting today, you&apos;ll see prompts for Facebook Connect at websites across the Internet and have the opportunity to take your Facebook profile information, friends and privacy preferences to your favorite sites. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 1&gt;If you&apos;ve used the early versions of Connect on &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.citysearch.com&quot;&gt;Citysearch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://theforum.cnn.com&quot;&gt;CNN&apos;s The Forum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theinsider.com&quot;&gt;CBS&apos; The Insider&lt;/a&gt;, this will already look pretty familiar.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, you can use Facebook Connect with the reviews website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.citysearch.com&quot;&gt;Citysearch&lt;/a&gt;.  You can easily log in using your Facebook account, and from there, you&apos;ll be able to interact with all of your Facebook friends.  They&apos;ll be able to see some of the same profile information they can see on Facebook, which is fully controlled by your privacy settings.  When you write a review for a restaurant, you&apos;ll have the option to publish that story back to Facebook, where your friends can see it, too.  This makes finding your friends&apos; reviews on Citysearch a snap. With Facebook Connect, it will be easier for you to share and connect with your friends across the Web.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&apos;ve worked hand in hand with our launch partners over the past several months to create great experiences for you to check out.   Use your Facebook account to comment on blogs including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;.   Compare your political stance with friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theforum.cnn.com&quot;&gt;CNN&apos;s The Forum&lt;/a&gt; and your voting record via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govit.com&quot;&gt;Govit&lt;/a&gt;.  Comment on the latest how-to videos on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howcast.com&quot;&gt;Howcast&lt;/a&gt;.   Get your friends&apos; opinions regarding your new car search with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vlane.com&quot;&gt;vLane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously our launch partners don&apos;t cover all the websites you use on a daily basis, so if you want to see this list grow, get in touch with your favorite websites, developers, and services, and tell them you want to connect.    With your help, we can all share more information across the web. </content>

    <title>Food for Thought: Facebook&apos;s Biggest Energy Source</title>

    <summary>Recently, we asked ourselves what Facebook&apos;s biggest energy source is.</summary>
    <content type="html">Recently, we asked ourselves what Facebook&apos;s biggest energy source is.  Initially, we assumed it was the electricity needed to power our servers and network, but after some consideration, it turns out to be the daily input of the more than 120 million active users -- including you -- who create the content that defines our site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet is constantly reminding us of the sheer power of &quot;people-powered&quot; systems, drawing their strength from the active involvement of their participants.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/&quot;&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt;, a scholar and author, has long written about this effect in areas as wide-ranging as government, education, media and entertainment.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day while the Facebook data team was considering the full sweep of people&apos;s engagement with Facebook, we wondered what it actually takes to power the &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; who power our service.  People spend an aggregate of more than 2 billion minutes on Facebook each day, contributing content and staying in touch with their friends and families and typically spend  between &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate&quot;&gt;1 and 2 calories per minute&lt;/a&gt; while resting at their computers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This means that it takes at least 2 billion calories per day to generate all of Facebook&apos;s content. That&apos;s equivalent to 35 million carrots, or, if you prefer a sweeter snack, 17 million bowls of Frosted Flakes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Cameron Marlow, a research scientist at Facebook, just spent 6.5 calories writing this blog post.&lt;/i&gt;  </content>

    <summary>We&apos;ve talked before about the massive amount of data running through Facebook&apos;s systems.

    <content type="html">We&apos;ve talked before about the massive amount of data running through Facebook&apos;s systems.  We have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/lexicon/new/&quot;&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; to help visualize what people are talking about on the site, but we don&apos;t yet have any similar, graphics-driven way to show the site&apos;s constant activity and connections.  Taking a break from my normal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/jobs&quot;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; (if dealing with Facebook&apos;s massive scalability challenges counts as normal) at the most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=36101077130&quot;&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to brush off my graphics abilities and work on something more visual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I focused on a project known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir&quot;&gt;Palantir&lt;/a&gt;.  We&apos;re still experimenting with it, but the idea is to show Facebook in action, with people&apos;s interactions speeding across a computer model of the earth, as if friend requests, messages or photo-sharing exchanges were bursts of light or airplanes flying to their destinations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Palantir was started at a previous hackathon with basic visualizations for actions.  After an all-night coding binge, the framework now has the potential to visualize many kinds of data: social interaction, the effectiveness of the Facebook advertising model, or even actions in your own network of friends. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s also another example of our commitment to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2223862130&quot;&gt;open-source software&lt;/a&gt;, in which public access to the underlying code allows a wide range of people to make improvements.  On the server side, it filters data that Facebook generates daily, accessed using a combination of our open source protocols &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/&quot;&gt;Thrift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=35548642130&quot;&gt;Scribe&lt;/a&gt;.  The client is written in Java using the open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/&quot;&gt;jME&lt;/a&gt; framework, which connects to the Palantir server and streams this data live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/facebook#/video/video.php?v=37403547074&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the first iteration of Palantir, which shows 3 1/2 minutes of Facebook activity this way.  New ties are forming every second between the United States and Latin America; between Europe and Australia; and in fact between almost any two parts of the planet.  Seeing the data come to life shows how our world is becoming more and more connected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jack Lindamood wishes we could get frequent-flyer miles for Palantir&apos;s activity.&lt;/i&gt;</content>

Shopaholics are waking up at dawn to get to the best sales of the year.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE4AM1S420081123&quot;&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt; show that Black Friday sales are up amid the financial downturn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The shopping buzz extends everywhere –- ads in magazines and billboards, websites dedicated to finding the best sales and of course, Facebook.  Just as Facebook helps you connect with the people you care about and share information, you can also use Facebook during the holidays to get the most out of your shopping experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Become a fan of your favorite stores to get news about sales and special events, create an event around a shopping trip and invite your friends or update your status to tell your friends about a great sale you spotted or a recent purchase.  You can also join one of dozens of Facebook groups for people who love Black Friday or give your friends a Facebook shopping gift.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of your favorite retailers, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/dell?ref=s&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/eBay/5840468513?ref=s&quot;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/Sephora?ref=s&quot;&gt;Sephora&lt;/a&gt; are offering free shopping gifts in the Facebook gift shop.

Retailers are also promoting sales and giving out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/sears?ref=s&quot;&gt;coupons and discounts&lt;/a&gt; though Facebook Pages and Events.  So, before you rush out this holiday season, log onto Facebook and search for your favorite stores to find the best deals.

    <summary>Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.  This year I won&apos;t be going home to spend the holiday with my family, but I will be chatting with them on Facebook.

Recently, my parents joined Facebook.  My mom and dad have been setting up their profile and learning about the site.</summary>
    <content type="html">Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.  This year I won&apos;t be going home to spend the holiday with my family, but I will be chatting with them on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;Photo 5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recently, my parents joined Facebook.  My mom and dad have been setting up their profile and learning about the site.  Of course, this has required some help from me and my brother and my step-sisters and my cousins and…well, the whole family.  But we&apos;re all pretty excited that we can now communicate with my parents on Facebook.  My mom and dad are even happier that they can share photos with us, send messages and read about what we&apos;re up to in their News Feed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My parents aren&apos;t the only ones joining Facebook—so are their friends.  In fact, their age group represents one of our fastest growing demographics.  As a Product Manager on the Growth team, I&apos;ve been excited to see a significant increase in people my parents&apos; age joining Facebook over the past year, both in the US and abroad.  Facebook is for everyone and as the site grows, people—including my parents—can connect with more of their friends and family, no matter where they are.  Facebook is even more important to me now that my parents are my Facebook friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, this Thanksgiving, instead of having a Turkey dinner with my family, I&apos;ll just have to do with sending them &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/giftshop.php?&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tip: Create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/friends/?ref=tn&quot;&gt;Friends List&lt;/a&gt; for your family, and add your parents, sibilings and extended family.  You&apos;ll have an easier time sending them a message all at once, inviting them to family events or making sure no one but your family sees your embarrassing holiday photos.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ability to share information with those around you can create amazing opportunities.  Every day, millions of people update their status on Facebook.  Whether going to a movie, visiting a friend or cleaning their apartment, many people use their status as an invitation for friends to join them in whatever they&apos;re doing.  Of course, this can mean that some statuses lead to unexpected results.  We recently heard the story of one Realtor who successfully sold a house through one of his Facebook status updates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On a Tuesday in August, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonesgroupsf.com/agents_details.php?agent_ID=4&quot;&gt;Brad Smith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonesgroupsf.com/&quot;&gt;Vanguard Properties&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco was on his way out the door to show one of his listings on a broker tour.  Before leaving, he updated his Facebook status to read, &quot;Bradley is going to do a broker tour.  I will be showing a cute one bedroom at $359k.  Do you know anyone who&apos;s interested?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right after posting his status, Brad received a Chat message from a Facebook friend who said he was currently looking for a two-bedroom home.  As it turned out, his friend didn&apos;t have a real estate agent yet.  Brad took him out three days later and showed him a two-bedroom home that was perfect.  A week after Brad&apos;s status update, they closed the deal. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Austin, an Analyst in User Operations, is hoping to find his next apartment on Facebook.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
