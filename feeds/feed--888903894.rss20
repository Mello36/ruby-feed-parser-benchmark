			<title><![CDATA[ Pastebud Brings Bookmark-Powered Copy and Paste to the iPhone ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/pastebud_topper.jpg" width="320" height="210" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" align="right"/>Pastebud, a bookmarklet/webapp combo that works around the lack of a copy or paste function in the iPhone and iPod touch, has just gone live. And it's surprisingly elegant and painless, with a few small hitches.</p> <p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Pastebud's servers seem to be getting a solid traffic hit this morning, so the page, and service, might be hit-and-miss for a while after this post. Also, a note about copying email text is added below.</em></p> <p>At its heart, Pastebud is two bookmarklets&mdash;COPY and PASTE, naturally&mdash;that you install in your mobile Safari browser. If you sync your iPhone/touch to grab bookmarks from a desktop browser like Safari or Internet Explorer, it's easier to just head to Pastebud's site, drag the bookmarklets to your browser toolbar, and sync your device. If not, you can still head to Pastebud's site in mobile Safari and add the bookmarks, but you'll have to manually edit them to remove all the formatting before the <code>javascript:</code> code&mdash;something users of the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5053039/instapaper-app-saves-web-pages-for-offline-iphone-reading">Instapaper bookmarking app</a> are all too familiar with.</p> <p>Once you've installed the bookmarks (and probably re-arranged them higher in your list), you can head to any web page containing text you want to copy to a web form or email. Hit the "COPY" bookmark, and all the page text gets sent to Pastebud and put into a JavaScript-powered applet, where you select the particular text to copy by tapping and dragging to select.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/pastebud_copy.jpg" width="320" height="480" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>The two buttons at the top, an e-mail style "compose" on the left and "copy" on the right, send you to your email client and back to the web, respectively. As you can see, the text selected in the pic above arrives just fine in the Mail client&mdash;including links!</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/pastebud_email.jpg" width="320" height="321" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>One small issue, though, at least for those who don't pay $5 to Pastebud&mdash;it inserts a little "Pasted from my iPhone!" and promotion link in every paste. You can delete it, of course, but it's there every time:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/pastebud_nag.jpg" width="320" height="140" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>The Pastebud web site also notes that you can forward emails you want to copy/quote from to "your secret Pastebud address," which you should then add to your email contacts. I didn't get to try this out this morning before Pastebud's server(s) got slammed, so if you have, let us know in the comments.</p> <p>Pasting that copied text to any box on the web is just as easy, but comes with its own little nag. After selecting the text and hitting "Copy," simply browse to any site you want to paste to and hit the "PASTE" bookmarklet. Pastebud loads the page in its webapp again, and you click the "PASTE HERE" box to, well, paste there.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/pastebud_pastehere.jpg" width="320" height="178" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>And once your text arrives, you get a little pop-up box, asking you to upgrade for $5 to "make it even more convenient":</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/pastebud_nag32.jpg" width="320" height="192" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>For what it's worth, I've got nothing against the developer of a seriously inventive app system asking for a small fee inside their free-for-all version&mdash;just letting you know it's there before you dive in.</p> <p>Pastebud's creator has a step-by-step walkthrough on installing the bookmarklets and using the system at his page (which changes depending on if you visit from mobile Safari or another browser). As for the privacy of your copied text, this is what's posted:<br /> <blockquote>It's certainly safe enough for most uses. All clipboards are anonymous, and destroyed withing five minutes of copy. Email addresses are not saved on the server; we only use them to reply for copying.</p> <p>However, since your clipboard is being passed over the network in most cases, you should take care not to send anything sensitive.</p></blockquote> <p>There's also SSL connections, destroy-on-paste, and other security measures on the way for paying users, according to the developer's page.</p> <p>Tell us what you think of Pastebud and its bookmark work-around in the comments. <div class="related"><a href="http://pastebud.com/">Pastebud</a></div> </p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Google Chrome Officially Leaves Beta ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/chrome-logo.png" width="219" height="202" />Windows only: Google's new web browser, Google Chrome, has officially left its beta tag in the dust, graduating to a full-fledged 1.0 release today (just 100 days after the initial release).</p> <p>Yesterday we told you Google Chrome would be <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5106447/google-chrome-to-leave-beta-soon">leaving beta soon</a>, but we had no idea it would be this soon. According to the Official Google Blog:<br /> <blockquote>We have removed the beta label as our goals for stability and performance have been met but our work is far from done. We are working to add some common browser features such as form autofill and RSS support in the near future. We are also developing an extensions platform along with support for Mac and Linux.</p></blockquote> <p>Good news all around for folks excited about what Google Chrome has to offer. If you've been waiting to try it out until Chrome dropped the beta tag, check out our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5045904/the-power-users-guide-to-google-chrome">power user's guide to Google Chrome</a>.

			<title><![CDATA[ VLC Remote Adds iPhone Control to Our Favorite Media App ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/vlc_remote.jpg" width="320" height="226" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" align="right"/>iPhone/iPod touch only: VLC Remote Free lets you play, pause, and skip tracks on the mighty <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Media Player</a> on any computer from your iPhone or iPod touch. </p> <p>Its (currently) 99-cent sibling, VLC Remote, gives you full playlist control. Both are fairly simple to set up on your computer and hook up over a wireless network, and work well in conjunction with the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5056204/vlc-09-revamps-interface-playlist-features">new playlist features</a> in the latest version of the open source player for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Setting up remote access requires only a quick plug-in download on all three platforms, and the Free edition can then skip forward and backward on a pre-loaded play list, as well as control the volume and move around a video or audio file. The full app, however, allows selecting playlist items, and even remotely browsing your system's entire hard drive for media. Read on for a walkthrough and screenshots of both VLC Remote versions.</p> <p>After grabbing the iPhone or iPod app, head to the developer's site to <a href="http://www.hobbyistsoftware.com/VLCSetup.php">grab a setup helper</a> and follow the instructions to install it. As it installs, the VLC Remote helper will ask whether you want to open up streaming on local networks or over the internet&mdash;unless you're really sure you've got your ports locked down, it's better to choose the local-only route. On Windows systems, you'll likely get a familiar Windows Firewall prompt, which you can hit "Unblock" on.</p> <p>Once that's set up, open VLC Media Player on your system. Launch VLC Remote from your mobile device, and you'll first get a nag screen reminding you to install the helper application. Past that, you'll see a connection screen asking you to choose an IP address&mdash;thankfully, the systems that it detects VLC running on get the familiar road cone icon next to them.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/connect.jpg" width="320" height="480" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>If you've grabbed the free version, you'll see the basic controls, a single bar of iPhone app ads at the top, and a few semi-helpful buttons along the bottom:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/free.jpg" width="320" height="480" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>The full version grants a scroll area below the controls to flick through your playlist with, and removes the ads and "Get Paid Version!" button:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/full.jpg" width="320" height="480" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>What's really neat in the full version, though also kind of scary, is hitting the "Browse" button and seeing a complete hard drive directory, which you can follow all the way back to your hard drive root. I couldn't find a way to change or limit this ability in VLC or the app's settings during my brief look, so if you do, please share it in the comments.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/browse.jpg" width="320" height="480" class="center" align="center"/></p> <p>VLC Remote Free is a, uh, free download for iPhones and iPod touch models running at least the 2.0 software. VLC Remote is 99 cents (for a limited time, according to the developers). <div class="related"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299344206&mt=8">VLC Remote Free</a> & <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297244048&mt=8">VLC Remote</a> [iTunes App Store]</div> </p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Gmail Labs Gets SMS in Chat Again--For Real This Time ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmaillabssms.png" width="237" height="237" align="right" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" /> After a <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/almost-new-in-labs-sms-text-messaging.html">pulled-back launch</a> back in late October, Google has re-released SMS capabilities in Gmail Chat. </p> <p>It's still an "experimental feature" in Gmail Labs, but presumably after the false start it'll actually work this time&mdash;in the U.S., anyway. Googler Leo Dirac writes:<br /> <blockquote>We're just trying it out for cell phones in the United States right now, but you can send texts to your friends with US phone numbers from anywhere in the world. You can start by just typing a phone number or into the search box in the chat window on the left, then select "Send SMS." You can also select the contact you want to SMS first and then add their phone number.</p></blockquote> <p> Recipients will be able to respond to you, and you'll get their message in the chat window.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmailabssmsbackandforth.png" width="225" height="271" /><br /> <blockquote>On the receiving end, when you get a text message from Gmail on your phone, it will come from a number in the 406 area code. (The l33t folks in the crowd will note that this spells G0O.) You can reply to this text on your phone just like you'd reply to any other text. The reply gets routed back to our Gmail servers and shows up in your friend's Gmail chat window. Each of your friends' messages will come from a different 406 number so you can reply to any message and it will get back to the right person. Messages from the same person will always come from the same number, so you can even bookmark it in your phone.</p></blockquote> <p>Not only is this a great way to get to friends on the go when you're at your computer, but it'll also save you sent message charges on your own phone bill. <div class="related"><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/really-new-in-labs-this-time-sms-text.html">Really new in Labs this time: SMS Text Messaging for chat</a> [Official Gmail Blog]</div> </p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Five Tips for Saving Time Over the Holidays ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><script type="text/javascript">newVideoPlayer("/Money_Time_Adam.flv", 506, 423,"");</script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/Money_Time_Adam.flv.jpg" style="display: none;" />Everyone's talking about budgeting money in the face of a bleak economic outlook this holiday season, but if there's one thing we never have enough of during the holidays, it's time. </p> <p>Yesterday I was lucky enough to join CNBC On the Money's Carmen Wong Ulrich to offer a few helpful tips for saving time over the holidays. The segment&mdash;embedded here&mdash;was cut short for time (I would have loved to have a little more time to talk Lifehacker), which meant that the original list of five holiday timesavers plus some was cut down to a quick three. Keep reading for our full list of the five best holiday timesavers.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">1. Do Your Shopping Online</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/long-lines_01.png" width="350" height="350" />Not only will you avoid the long lines, but you can also save a lot of money by doing your shopping online. Amazon is an obvious favorite for online shopping, and for good reason, but you can also find also find incredible deals with our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5103875/the-savvy-shoppers-guide-to-this-years-online-deal-finders">savvy shopper's guide to online deal finders</a>. Just remember&mdash;if you're doing your shopping online, you need to be aware of shipping deadlines. Most sites prominently display these deadlines, but this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5102480/master-list-of-holiday-shipping-deadlines">previously mentioned list of holiday shipping deadlines</a> nicely aggregates them if you're looking for some eleventh hour shipping. <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fleur-design/1338172369/">The Pug Father</a></i>. <br clear="all" /></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">2. Tackle Work Commitments Early</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/holiday-cube.png" width="350" height="270" />Be aware of your upcoming workload and plan accordingly. Identify any projects or other work-related issues that could fall in your lap at the last minute and take time away from your family; then do what you can to address those issues ahead of time so you're not celebrating the season in your cubicle.<i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mojodenbowsphotostudio/310804652/">Photo Mojo</a></i>.<br clear="all" /></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">3. Get Ready for Guests Ahead of Time</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/xmas-group.png" width="350" height="282" />Again, it's all about preparation. Do the necessary shopping, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/holidays/how-to-plan-a-thanksgiving-meal-138696.php">plan out your meals</a> ahead of time, and know when your guests will arrive. Last minute errands can be a huge holiday time-sink&mdash;especially when you have to run them at the same time as all the other last-minute errand runners. You're bound to forget <em>something</em>, but the more prepared you are going in, the better off you'll be. <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/editor/2735376855/">Editor B</a></i>.<br clear="all" /></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">4. Limit Your Commitments</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/holiday-party.png" width="350" height="333" />We have a tendency to <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/02/050211084233.htm">overestimate how many social commitments we can squeeze into our lives</a>, especially around the holidays. Just remember: You don't need to attend every holiday party of and buy a gift for every single one of your acquaintances. The holidays are about spending time with the people you love; you don't need to do everything, and limiting your commitments can take a lot of stress out of the holidays. <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/goodrob13/2496651004/">goodrob13</a></i>.<br clear="all" /></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">5. Take Extra Time for Travel</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/long-lines-airport.png" width="350" height="291" />Make sure to budget plenty of time for your travel to save time in the long run, especially if you're flying. Everyone's heading to the airport during the holidays, and if you don't budget your time for traffic delays and long lines, you'll find that missed flights and baggage drama will ultimately cost a lot more of your time time than building in extra time to your travel on the front end. <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dougww/2609007238/">dougww</a></i>.<br clear="all" /></p> <p>Thanks again to CNBC for having me. Share you secrets for saving time over the holidays in the comments.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/28147307">2 Weeks 'Til Christmas, 3 Ways to Stretch Your Dollar</a> [CNBC]</div> ]]></description>

The Minimalistic skin has been fixed (<i>thanks Scott!</i>) and the extension is now compatible with Firefox 3.1 Beta 2.</p> <p>The only sad news is that we lost the excellent OS X skin, which hasn't been updated to work with Google Reader's redesign. <del>I'm also hearing reports that the Preview button script isn't working, but it is in my tests; if it isn't for you in version 0.5, please post what version of Firefox you're using on what platform (XP, Vista, Mac, or Linux) and I'll continue to try to get to the bottom of the problem.</del> <i>Update:</i> The Preview button is now working; Automatic Preview only works in list view, not expanded. <i>Thanks, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5106680/better-greader-extension-gets-new-features-plus-fixes#c9385140">Chrismith</a>!</i> In the meantime, Better GReader is a free download for all platforms with Firefox. <div class="related"><a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/trick-out-google-reader-with-better-greader-262020.php">Better GReader Firefox Extension</a></div> </p> ]]></description>

Today we're looking back at the Linux-related posts that got the most attention in 2008, so read on to see what you might have missed, and what the open-source crowd is down with. <em>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ypsy/2502539098/">Ypsy</a>.</em></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;"><a href="http://lifehacker.com/391067/fedora-9-puts-your-desktop-on-a-usb-drive">Fedora 9 Puts Your Desktop on a USB Drive</a></h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/2008_fedora.jpg" width="300" height="183" class="right" align="right">There are many tools one can use to create live-booting Linux desktops on a USB drive, including the multi-distro <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">UNetbootin</a>. Back when Fedora 9 was officially <a href="http://lifehacker.com/390056/fedora-9-officially-released">released</a>, though, the Red Hat spin-off made a splash by giving us an easy-to-grasp, Windows-based tool for automatically downloading the latest Fedora release and putting it on a USB stick, along with allowing for extra space for storing changes you made to your system and documents you worked on . The <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/">Live USB Creator</a> still works with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5099393/fedora-10-officially-released-ready-for-download">Fedora 10</a>, and very well might have inspired Ubuntu's 8.10 release to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5070747/ubuntu-810-released-includes-bootable-usb-maker">include a similar tool</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;"><a href="http://lifehacker.com/358208/seamlessly-run-linux-apps-on-your-windows-desktop">Seamlessly Run Linux Apps on Your Windows Desktop</a></h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/2008_wintux2.jpg" width="226" height="200" class="right" align="right">There's probably a few Windows-only apps that make living in Linux pretty hard for even those intrigued at the idea&mdash;but there's also some Linux apps that would be great to have on your Windows system. Adam detailed how you can put what's basically a full Ubuntu installation onto your desktop with <a href="http://www.andlinux.org/downloads.php">andLinux</a>, using it to enable and launch apps like Amarok, the Akregator RSS reader, or whatever else you're into.

You could actually install it only as a Windows boot option without messing with your system's boot record, or easily access both Windows and Linux-formatted drives from either system. You could share settings between open-source apps like Firefox, Pidgin, and Thunderbird, and your ability to customize your desktop was pretty boundless. We try not to rant too often here, but sometimes it's worth letting fly with the links and inline pictures.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;"><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5058730/first-look-at-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex-beta">First Look at Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex Beta</a></h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/2008_ibex_01.jpg" width="300" height="193" class="right" align="right">There wasn't half as much new in October's 8.10 release of Ubuntu as there had been in the majorly re-spun 8.04, but a bunch of seriously helpful usability tweaks made it worth the upgrade. Much-improved network and wireless management (including baked-in 3G card support), a graphical indicator for the installation partition editor, and hardware and dual-monitor managers that explained more of what was happening. Ubuntu-savvy author Keir Thomas also gave us a more <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5072351/a-users-look-at-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex">in-depth, user-focused look at 8.10</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Lifehacker Faceoffs: Battles of the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5069054/battle-of-the-thumb-drive-linux-systems">Thumb Drive Linux Systems</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5054510/battle-of-the-linux-distros">Linux Distros</a></h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/2008_distro_battle.jpg" width="300" height="121" class="right" align="right">We describe, you decide. We couldn't pretend to cover every desktop Linux operating system or live-boot-able, portable-minded distro out there, so we offered up a few popular, prime examples and polled our reader for their preference. As of this morning, Ubuntu held a commanding 49 percent in the desktop poll, followed by Ubuntu variants like Kubuntu/Xubuntu, then PC Linux OS (surprising!) and Fedora. In the thumb drive wars, Ubuntu still rules the roost at 29 percent, followed closely by Puppy Linux at 24 percent, then Fedora and Damn Small Linux at 13 and 12 percent, respectively.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Five more popular Linux posts</h3> <ul> <li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5076585/five-tweaks-for-your-new-ubuntu-desktop"><strong>Five Tweaks for Your New Ubuntu Desktop</strong></a>&mdash;Taken from the first things your editor always finds himself doing upon a new install.

You can read the article in full color and in its original context, just as you would in the printed magazine. Scroll back a few pages, for example, and you'll find a two-page spread on 1973's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=r9QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=hank+aaron+catching+babe+ruth&amp;ei=HpI8SeShB4fkzATJ-KXEDw#PPA142,M2" id="yta9" title="fall fashions" name="yta9">fall fashions</a>.

			<title><![CDATA[ Fonolo Cuts Through Corporate Voicemail Trees ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/fonolo_cover6.jpg" width="289" height="198" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" align="right">Fonolo, an online phone tool for getting past all the "Press X for ..." prompts on customer service numbers, is now open for public beta. Our sister site Consumerist <a href="http://consumerist.com/5031607/fonolocom-slash-and-burns-dread-phone-trees">took a screenshot tour</a> when Fonolo was privately tested, and it looks much the same&mdash;in other words, just as cool. Pick a company, browse their phone directory tree by title and automated dialog, choose where you want to jump in, and Fonolo calls you with a direct connection there. We gave Fonolo a quick spin this morning, so read on for screenshots and a quick tutorial on working some auto-dial jujitsu.</p> <p>Fonolo has limited their directory of businesses covered during their beta phase, but there's still a good range of companies covered&mdash;credit card issuers, cell carriers, retailers, even AARP and EZ-Pass (the New-England-area auto-toll taker). Once you've signed up with a username, password, email, and your phone numbers, you'll validate your email and be on your way.</p> <p>After searching or browsing through their directory for the firm you want to get into, hit the "View Menu" button to see Fonolo's trace of their automated phone tree. You can click "Call here" to get to any area, and where you see little human icons, that's a direct connection to a customer service representative&mdash;the person you usually try to get to by jamming "0."</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/fonolo_tree.jpg" class="center" width="515" height="921" style="display:block;" /></p> <p>The one drawback I see at a glance is that Fonolo can't auto-store account numbers and get you past the prompts asking for them. That's obviously a whole bushel of privacy and security issues to deal with, but if I'm looking to get deep into a company to deal with a thorny issue, I definitely want to skip past carefully entering 16 digits over touch-tone.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/fonolo_connecting.jpg" width="281" height="129" class="right" align="right">If you've found the prompt, or human, you want to connect to, simply hit the button and Fonolo asks which of your phones you want to be called on when it gets through. It's not instant, because Fonolo is actually doing the drudgery of dialing, pressing "1" for English, hitting "3" for customer service on existing accounts, etc. And you can watch it happen&mdash;or, actually, just walk away and wait for your cell to ring:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/fonolo_calling.jpg" class="center" width="388" height="297" style="display:block;" /></p> <p>Fonolo's service worked for me on the three services I tried out&mdash;Chase credit cards, HSBC, and EZ-Pass&mdash;but, as noted above, I usually couldn't get past any point where the company wanted an account number to continue. Once you're done calling, you can take note of what happened or what needs to be done on the next call, and leave Fonolo some feedback if you had problems:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/fonolo_feedback.jpg" width="312" height="359" class="center" align="center"></p> <p>That's about it for this beta of Fonolo. Sign-ups are free at the moment, so if you give it a try, let us know how it works for you. Looking for a less automated end-run around customer service prompts? Try the <a href="http://www.dialahuman.com/">Dial A Human!</a> directory, or the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5043589/direct-line-takes-you-straight-to-an-operator">previously mentioned</a> 99-cent iPhone app <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288458307&mt=8">Direct Line</a>.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://fonolo.com/">Fonolo</a> [via <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/12/09/fonolo-moves-to-public-beta/">Web Worker Daily</a>]</div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Battle of the Hardware-Boosting Hacks ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/hardware_hacks_faceoff.jpg" width="494" height="250" style="display:block;" /><br> When like-minded hackers come together to unleash the true power of seemingly simple gear, it's truly a beautiful thing. We've featured a good number of how-tos and hacks over the years that make expensive upgrades unnecessary and unleash seriously cool features in your gear, and 2008 was no exception. In the last year, our iPhones and iPod touches got jailbroken all over again, our wireless routers were graced with a new super-charged firmware, our Canon digi-cams gained pro-level powers, and we learned that our Nintendo Wiis were even neater than we'd thought. Today, however, we wanted to take a long view on the best hacks that unlock the best features in our standard hardware, and ask our readers: What's the best one you've seen so far? Take a look at our gallery of gear-boosters, and vote on a champion, below.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Jailbreak tools for iPhones/iPod touch</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/faceoff_pwnage.png" class="right" width="415" height="318" style="display:block;">When the iPhone 3G and its 2.0 software was <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398245/iphone-20-update-to-add-polish-and-apps">released</a>, some of us thought that might be the end of jailbreaking, or opening up your device to third-party, non-approved applications (and, in some cases, mobile carriers). We thought wrong, as there were many <a href="http://lifehacker.com/400148/iphone-20-jailbreak-apps-you-cant-find-in-the-itunes-store">apps worth jailbreaking for</a>, and the process got much simpler with the Mac-based <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398906/jailbreak-iphone-20-with-pwnagetool">Pwnagetool</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/399198/jailbreak-iphone-20-on-windows-with-winpwn">Winpwn for Windows</a>. The greater issue is that Apple's been roundly criticized for rejecting any software that "replicates" its own apps, and is somewhat secretive about just why it kills and delays other apps, so jailbreaking will likely always have a home on Apple's multi-touch devices.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Canon Hacker's Development Kit</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/chdk-userscripts.png" width="250" height="187" class="right" align="right">If you've ever been intrigued by time-lapse photography, motion-sensing shutters that can capture lightning, or being able to shoot videos of any serious length, you might not need to shell out for a semi-serious DSLR model&mdash;if you've got a Canon, that is. The <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK</a> lets you do all that and more, including record your photos in the very work-able RAW format, get way more on-screen information about your shots and their settings, and, as Adam put it, generally <a href="http://lifehacker.com/387380/turn-your-point+and+shoot-into-a-super+camera">turn your point-and-shoot into a super-camera</a>. The possibilities are vast, given the number of <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/UBASIC/Scripts">user-created scripts</a> the CHDK can run. And, in true hacker fashion, you can even play a game or two on your LCD screen (while you pretend to be setting up that staged photo mom and dad want, perhaps).</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Homemade Wi-Fi extenders</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/router_hacking.png" width="303" height="189" class="right" align="right">Sure, you could give Linksys (or Buffalo, or D-Link, or Apple, et al.) the extra cash for an extended, wider-range router than the standard box you've tucked away in the living room or office. But if you don't mind doing just a few minutes of DIY work, you can also create your own higher-powered antennas. We've covered a few ways of doing so, including <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/how-to/boost-your-wireless-signal-with-a-homemade-wifi-extender-296367.php">tinfoil and paper parabolas</a>, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/macgyver-tip/boost-your-wi+fi-antenna-for-less-than-a-dollar-324681.php">internal wiring replacements</a>, and, for that steampunk feel, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5053796/boost-your-wi+fi-signal-with-cooking-strainer">cooking strainer extenders</a>. If you want to actually boost the <em>power</em> your router gives up, well, we're covering that farther down, but these are all relatively safe and damage-free ways to ensure a solid connection throughout your house.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">XBOX Media Center (and its variants)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/faceoff_xbmc.png" width="329" height="235" class="right" align="right">Ever since our boss bought a "classic," first-generation XBOX off eBay and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/transform-your-classic-xbox-into-a-killer-media-center-299809.php">turned it into a media center</a> with the open-source <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBOX Media Center</a>, she's been using to organize all the media that makes it to her television, stereo, and other screens. In the meantime, XBMC has spawned a number of intriguing remixes and spin-offs, including <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a>, and now works on pretty much any platform that's got video cards and a hard drive&mdash;Windows, Mac, Linux, XBOX models, and even Apple TVs. If buying another whole system just to watch your downloaded videos and stream MP3s across the house sounds like overkill, use what you've got with XBMC.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">The Hackintosh</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/faceoff_hackintosh.png" width="300" height="219" class="right" align="right">A good number of folks are impressed with Apple's OS X operating system, yet can't bring themselves to pay the hefty premium for the hardware that Apple says is required for it. But since Steve Jobs & Co. made the switch to Intel processors, a community of hackers has been working to make Tiger/Leopard/et. al. run on gear you can assemble yourself, and, as Adam showed us, there's now a command-line-free way to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/348653/install-os-x-on-your-hackintosh-pc-no-hacking-required">install OS X on a "Hackintosh" PC</a>. Checking out the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/benchmarks/hackintosh-vs-mac-pro-vs-macbook-pro-benchmarks-322866.php">benchmarks</a>, you'll see there's not a lot, if any, performance loss in using unlicensed hardware, and the best part is you can have the case and your peripherals look however you want, and cost whatever you can afford.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Super-Router upgrades &mdash; DD-WRT and Tomato</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/tomato_router.png" width="300" height="249" class="right" align="right">As mentioned above, some home network routers just can't reach around all the walls in your house. And if you want to set up specific bandwidth rules&mdash;giving you, say, lots of room for World of Warcraft at night, but throttling your BitTorrents while you're actually working&mdash;you're usually out of luck. Unless, that is, you've loaded <a href="http://dd-wrt.com">DD-WRT</a> or <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> on your router. We've walked through installations of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/router/hack-attack-turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router-178132.php">both</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/344765/turn-your-60-router-into-a-user+friendly-super+router-with-tomato">systems</a> and toured a bit of what they can do. Plus, as many have attested, they can make a router more stable, freeing you from frequent oh-crap-hope-that-page-saves runs to re-plug your misbehaved little guy.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Homebrew Wii</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/faceoff_wii_homebrew.png" width="300" height="187" class="right" align="right">It's hard to say, exactly, why Nintendo didn't include DVD playback capabilities on its Wii game system, given that its games are, well, DVDs. So it was only a matter of time before <a href="http://wiibrew.org">a few clever folks</a> came up with a way of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/400581/hack-your-wii-for-homebrew-apps-and-dvd-playback">getting homebrew apps and DVD playback on the Wii</a>, without anyone having to bust out a screwdriver or soldering iron. You can <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5041110/soup-up-your-homebrew+hacked-wii">add a lot more</a> to that Homebrew Wii channel, and, if you're cool with Nintendo absolutely disliking your doing so, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5080006/play-burned-game-backups-on-your-wii-without-a-modchip">play backed-up Wii games</a> on it. While you're feeling geeky, you can put your Wiimotes to use in reverse by <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5042254/operate-your-computer-with-wii-controllers">controlling your computer with them</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Rescue old hardware with Linux</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/old_laptop.jpg" width="300" height="198" class="right" align="right">Okay, so it's not really doing anything to your hardware that a Windows installation doesn't do. But saving an older, lower-powered computer from e-cycling (or a long, slow twilight in the garage) is one of the main <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5044212/why-lifehacker-readers-switched-to-linux">reasons Lifehacker readers switched to, or tried out, Linux</a>. Seriously dated gear can often work just fine in a modern world with <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a> or <a href="http://damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a>, and your mid-range systems&mdash;like, say, the last Dell you bought before this one&mdash;can be <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/hack-attack/turn-your-old-pc-into-a-webapp-monster-with-gos-318346.php">spun into a slick, webapp-focused system</a> with <a href="http://www.thinkgos.com/">gOS</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Rockbox and iPod Linux</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/faceoff_rockbox.jpg" width="300" height="239" class="right" align="right"><em><strong>Update:</strong> Added after the initial post, due to popular demand/outcry. No intentional slight intended!</em><br> In case you needed an example of Linux completely transforming seemingly outdated hardware into the new hotness, music monster <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a>, and its games-focused counterpart <a href="http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page">iPod Linux</a>. Rockbox is the glitzier of the pair, adding customized themes, CoverFlow-like shuffling and other current-generation features to your seemingly out-paced iPod, but iPod Linux gives you some serious freedom inside your tiny computer, and has a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/ipod/hack-attack-play-games-on-your-ipod-for-free-202414.php">pretty nice roster of games</a>. For a look around Rockbox, check out Adam's tour of the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5056370/breathe-new-life-into-your-aging-mp3-player-with-rockbox">latest release</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Your choice</h3> <p>Now that you've refreshed your memory on all the weekend-filling projects we've featured here, we want to hear which one truly made your life better, or at least got you excited to be tweaking settings again. Vote for your favorite, or share your own favorite hardware-freeing hack in the comments.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/1179685.js"> </script><noscript><a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1179685/">What's the best hardware-boosting hack you've seen on Lifehacker?</a><br> <span style="font-size:9px;">( <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com">surveys</a>)</span></noscript></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Gmail Labs' New Task Manager Can Add Email to Your To-Do List ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmaillabstasks02.png" width="271" height="234" align="right" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" />For years now, the gaping hole in Google's online suite of applications has been a to-do list manager, but not anymore: today Gmail Labs adds a lightweight Tasks module to your email account. The killer feature? You can add a Gmail message to your task list in one click or keystroke. To get started, enable Tasks in the Gmail Labs section of your Settings area, and a Tasks link will appear below your Contacts link. Click on that to make a Task list appear on the bottom right of your screen (like chat), and there you can create multiple lists and switch between them, indent items, mark them as complete, drag and drop to reorder items, and view or clear completed items. To turn an email into a task, from the More Actions drop-down, choose "Add to Tasks." There are also copious keyboard shortcuts.</p> <p>The Googlers explain:</p> <blockquote><p> 1. Manage your email workflow better by converting emails into tasks: "More Actions > Add to Tasks"</p> <p> 2. ENTER creates a new task, TAB and SHIFT-TAB indent and un-indent, CTRL-UP and CTRL-DOWN let you reorder from the keyboard, and SHIFT-ENTER toggles back and forth between the detailed view for a task and the main view</p> <p> 3. After turning Tasks on, turn on Keyboard shortcuts in "Settings > General" and then use "SHIFT-T" to create tasks from your emails - even faster than using the More Actions menu</p></blockquote> <p> You can also pop out the Tasks module into its own window, like you can with chat. If you select a particular item, click on the gray arrow pointing to the right to edit the task's details, add a note and/or a due date, or remove the related email message, as shown.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/taskdetails.png" width="287" height="323" align="center" class="center"/></p> <p>The new Tasks module is huge news for GTD'ers who love Gmail, and while it's an experimental feature that's pretty lightweight, at first blush Tasks is looking very nicely done. Is Labs' Tasks feature looking good enough to lure you away from your current online to-do manager? Let us know what you think in the comments. <div class="related"><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-in-labs-tasks.html">New in Labs: Tasks</a> [Official Gmail Blog]</div> </p> ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/collage.jpg" width="800" height="450" style="display:block;float:none;" />Over the past year, we've <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/featured-desktop/">featured gobs of great desktops</a> submitted by our readers to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/lifehacker-desktop-showandtell/">Lifehacker Desktop Show and Tell group</a> on Flickr. In the process, we've seen beautiful desktop transformations that have ranged in difficulty from a few simple tweaks to extreme desktop makeovers that transcend operating systems. Let's take a look back at the most popular reader-submitted desktops of 2008 and bask in the glow of their customizing prowess.</p> <p><em>NOTE: Click the image for larger pictures of each desktop and the original description, complete with more details on how each desktop was accomplished.</em></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;"><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5087956/customize-your-own-killer-enigma-desktop">The Enigma Desktop</a></h3> <p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5087956/customize-your-own-killer-enigma-desktop"><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/Preview_01.jpg" width="494" height="308" style="display:block;"></a>This killer desktop setup includes a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5087956/customize-your-own-killer-enigma-desktop">detailed how-to guide for creating your own Enigma desktop</a>, complete with a download full of customization goodies.

			<title><![CDATA[ The Savvy Shopper's Guide to This Year's Online Deal Finders ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/onlineshopperheader.jpg" width="494" height="295" style="display:block;" /> With all the belt-tightening going on in this economy, it's no surprise that coupon codes and deal finders&mdash;especially for online shoppers&mdash;are the hottest tools on the web right now. With <a href="http://www.dealhack.com/deadlines.php">only a week or so left</a> to finish your online holiday shopping in time for the packages to show up at your door <i>before</i> the 24th, it's time to fill those virtual carts and get to hitting "Checkout." Before you do, make sure you're getting the best price possible using this year's latest crop of deal finders, price comparators, and clever product search engines. <i>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/55519741/">Thomas Hawk</a>.</i></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Deal Finders</h3> <p>Most deal search engines work the same way: You enter the product you're looking for and in some cases, the price point, and they return any better deals in their index, no email address required.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.beatmyprice.com/">BeatMyPrice.com</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5083271/beatmyprice-finds-deals-integrates-retailmenot">our full review</a>) looks up products on sale at a better price than an existing listing that you enter. Made by the same folks who brought you coupon-finder RetailMeNot (which is integrated into BeatMyPrice.com's results), BeatMyPrice.com combines user-entered prices as well as product listings across the web.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.gotodaily.com/">GotoDaily</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5069552/save-money-shopping-online-with-gotodaily">our full review</a>) is a straightforward coupon search engine. Enter a store web site or keywords and GotoDaily will list coupon codes and deals to be had; users can remove codes that don't work or add new codes that aren't listed.</p> <p><b><a href="http://beatthat.com/">BeatThat!</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/399996/beatthat-community-finds-online-shopping-deals">our full review</a>) is a community-driven deal search engine which indexes deals and coupons across the web and also gets entries from site users. Dedicated deal hunters can actually <i>make</i> money at BeatThat!, which pays its members for submitting deals that meet a certain criteria.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.freeshipping.org/">FreeShipping.org</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/382651/web-site-free-shipping-makes-shopping-online-cheaper">our full review</a>) rounds up free shipping coupons for over 600 stores online from the Gap to Macy's and Target and Home Depot and Land's End. Search by store or item to find free shipping coupon codes before you hit the "Purchase" button.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Price Drop Notifiers</h3> <p>Most price drop notification systems watch items you enter over time and email you when it goes on sale. While they'll all assure you that they'll never sell your email address or use it inappropriately, the paranoid can set up a spare free web mail account (like at Gmail) or use <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/instant-disposable-gmail-addresses-144397.php">the Gmail + trick</a> with your existing address to filter notification email and make sure it doesn't invite spam.</p> <p><b><a href="http://shoppingnotes.com/">ShoppingNotes.com</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5102442/shoppingnotescom-alerts-you-on-any-products-price-drop">our full review</a>) is a straight-up online price watcher. You enter the URL of a product online that you want to get at a better price, and ShoppingNotes will email you a price drop notification up to a number of days you specify (like, until December 20th).</p> <p><b><a href="http://zingsale.com/">ZingSale</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5098953/zingsale-notifies-you-when-products-go-on-sale">our full review</a>) is another straightforward email price drop notification tool. Enter your desired product and your email address, and ZingSale will trigger a message when it goes on sale.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.savvycircle.com/">Savvy Circle</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/364973/savvy-circle-monitors-your-wishlist-for-price-drops">our full review</a>) is a wishlist and price drop notification service. You add items from a <a href="http://www.savvycircle.com/page.php?page=stores">wide range of specific stores</a> to your Savvy Circle account's wishlist, and it watches those items in those stores and emails you when the item goes on sale.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.shopittome.com/">Shop It To Me</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/384849/shop-it-to-me-is-your-web+based-personal-shopper">our full review</a>) scours the internet for sales on clothing brands and accessories you specify from Adidas to Louis Vuitton, and sends you an email digest of the latest deals on those brands online. <i>Correction: Shop It To Me doesn't focus on sales at brick-and-mortar locations, as first stated. Apologies!</i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.pricepinx.com/">Price!pinx</a></b> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/364555/track-price-drops-at-any-site-with-pricepinx">our full review</a>) tracks price drops at any site and offers a handy bookmarklet to do just that. Give Price!pinx your email address and add items to your watch list by hitting the !pinx button on your toolbar.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Lesser-known Product Search Engines, Reviews, and Recommendations</h3> <p>While your favorite store's search engine, or Google, or Amazon.com might turn up most product results, a few new search engines that offer clever twists on gift-finding are also available this year.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/11/18/technology/personaltechspecial/20081118-pogue-o-matic.html">The Pogue-o-matic</a></b> is a fun, interactive product guide to choosing the best tech gear for your circumstances.

			<title><![CDATA[ Clone2Go Bulk Converts Video Formats ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/2008-12-07_151005.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="494" height="179" style="display:block;" /><br> Windows only: Clone2Go is an easy to use bulk video converter. It supports a wide variety of input formats such as: WMV, FLV, MPEG4, AVI, and 3GP. You can output to an equally as wide variety of formats to ensure you can transfer your media to portable devices like the iPod, Zune, and mobile phones. Clone2Go supports batch processing so you can load it up let it convert unattended. The encoding rate is rather snappy and the GUI is easy to navigate. An added bonus if you find yourself frequently snagging video files for your portable devices off of YouTube and Google Video, is integration with the sites. There is a pro version of the software that allows you to save custom profiles&mdash; the free version allows you to customize your settings as much as you like but not save the custom conversion tweaks you make&mdash; and gets rid of the nag screen that pops up after you're done converting. Still the presets in the free version are plentiful, you can tweak them if you need to just without saving, and the nag screen is tolerable in exchange for a free and easy to use converter. For other video encoding alternatives, check out the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5058888/five-best-media-converters">Five Best Media Converters</a>.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.clone2go.com/products/freevideo.php">Clone2go Free Video Converter</a> [via <a href="http://thefreewarejunkie.com/2008/12/easy-video-conversionagain-clone2go.html">Confessions of a Freeware Junkie</a>]</div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Five Best Media Center Applications ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/tv-boy.jpg" width="494" height="285" style="display:block;" /><iframe src="http://digg.com/api/diggthis.php?u=http://digg.com/software/Five_Best_Media_Center_Applications" align="right" frameborder="0" height="82" scrolling="no" width="55"></iframe>The past ten years have completely changed the way we listen to music, watch movies and television, and take photos, and one thing is abundantly clear: The future of your media lies undeniably in the digital realm. Now you just need to find the perfect media center application to pull it all together. Earlier this week we asked you to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5102034/best-media-center-applications">share your favorite media center applications</a>, and today we're back with the five most popular answers. Keep reading for a closer look at the favorites, then cast your vote for the media center app you count on to manage your digital media life. <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronescobar/2170448724/">Aaron Escobar</a></i>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">XBMC (Windows/Mac/Linux/Xbox/Apple TV)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/xbmc.png" width="800" height="449" style="display:block;float:none;"><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> (aka Xbox Media Center) is a free, open-source media center application designed, in the beginning, for the original Xbox. XBMC has made serious progress over the past year or so and can now run virtually anywhere&mdash;including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Apple TVs. Not only is XBMC an incredible media center app with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/weekend-project/soup-up-your-xbox-media-center-302821.php">tons of great add-ons and customization options</a>, but it's also spawned several popular forks, including Boxee (mentioned below). XBMC is in constant development and has gotten better and better at running on your PC, but if you've got an old Xbox hanging around, here's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/transform-your-classic-xbox-into-a-killer-media-center-299809.php">how to transform your classic Xbox with XBMC</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Boxee (Mac OS X/Apple TV/Linux)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/boxee-netflix.png" style="display:block;"><a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> is an XBMC fork with an emphasis on taking your media center into the social realm. Like XBMC, Boxee is free and open source, but while it's aiming for the same platforms, Boxee currently only supports Mac OS X, Linux, and the Apple TV. Still, a pre-alpha release of the Windows version was released to a small group of testers just last week, so if you're on Windows and you like what you see, it may not be long before there's a Boxee for you. Despite its aim to be your social media center, Boxee's great interface and impressive features&mdash;including recent <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5101903/boxee-updates-adds-support-for-netflix-windows-on-the-way">support for Netflix playback</a> and integration with online video sites like Hulu&mdash;demonstrate that Boxee isn't slacking on overall innovation.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Windows Media Center (Windows/Xbox 360)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/wmc.png" width="800" height="418" style="display:block;float:none;"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/media-center.aspx">Windows Media Center</a> brings a full and robust media management to your Windows operating system. Not only does Windows Media Center provide access to all your music, videos, photos, and more, but it also sports fantastic DVR functionality (it's like having a TiVo without the monthly bills). Microsoft released the first version of Windows Media Center with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx">Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005</a>, but Vista comes with Windows Media Center built in to its Home Premium and Ultimate editions. Sound interesting? Check out how you can <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/hack-attack/turn-your-windows-pc-into-a-media-center-powerhouse-on-the-cheap-298408.php">turn your Windows PC into a media center powerhouse on the cheap</a> with WMC, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/353559/watch-and-schedule-media-center-recordings-from-any-computer">watch and schedule Media Center recordings from any computer</a>, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/392999/vmcnetflix-streams-watch-now-videos-to-your-xbox-360">stream Netflix Watch Instantly videos in WMC</a>. Lastly, if you've got an Xbox 360, it works beautifully <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398035/do-more-than-just-game-on-your-xbox-360">as a Media Center extender for Windows Media Center</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">SageTV (Windows/Mac/Linux)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/SageTVv6EPG.jpg" width="800" height="500" style="display:block;float:none;"><a href="http://www.sagetv.com/">SageTV</a> is a cross-platform media center and DVR application. SageTV works great if all you want is a straightforward DVR, but it's also an awesome app for the consummate tweaker. In contrast to Windows Media Center, SageTV recordings are DRM free, so it's easy to convert your media and play back the files anywhere&mdash;and on any device&mdash;you like. SageTV is a commercial application that'll set you back $80, but a 21-day free trial is available if you want to kick the tires. For more, check out our old guide to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/dvr/hack-attack-build-your-own-dvr-165963.php">building your own DVR with SageTV</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/how-to/add-a-web-interface-to-your-homemade-dvr-297300.php">adding a web interface</a> that lets you play back and set up recordings from any web browser.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">MythTV (Linux)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/liquidtvmenu.png" width="800" height="532" style="display:block;float:none;"><a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> is a Linux-based DVR and media center application designed as a free, open-source alternative to TiVo and Windows Media Center. First started way back in 2002, MythTV is the granddaddy of many of the media centers in this Hive Five and many that aren't. Currently several Linux distributions come bundled with MythTV, including the popular <a href="http://mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html">KnoppMyth live CD</a> and <a href="http://www.mythbuntu.org/">Mythbuntu</a>. MythTV's biggest hurdle for new users is probably Linux, but if you're willing to roll up your sleeves or you've already got a little know-how, this saucy media center has a lot to offer.</p> <hr> Now that you've seen the best, it's voting time.<br> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/1172451.js"> </script><noscript><a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1172451/">Which Is the Best Media Center Application?</a><br> <span style="font-size:9px;">( <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com">surveys</a>)</span></noscript> <p>This week's honorable mentions go out to the open-source Windows-based media center and DVR, <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">MediaPortal</a>, and Mac OS X-based XBMC fork, <a href="http://elan.plexapp.com/">Plex</a>. Whether the media center love of your life made the short list or not, let's hear more about it in the comments.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Top 10 Things You Forgot Gmail Can Do ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/forgotgmailheader.png" width="494" height="300" style="display:block;" /> <iframe src="http://digg.com/api/diggthis.php?u=http://digg.com/tech_news/Top_10_Things_You_Forgot_Gmail_Can_Do" align="right" scrolling="no" width="55" frameborder="0" height="82"></iframe>When friends push friends onto Gmail, it usually involves talking up the seemingly limitless storage space, the fast-moving interface, or its inter-connectedness with other Google applications, like Calendar. Those features are all fine and good, but Gmail does a lot of helpful things that some users never get to dig into. From one short web address, you can video chat Skype-style with contacts, ensure you didn't leave yourself logged in elsewhere, help mom gradually migrate from her old dial-up-era email address, and pluck a single message out of tens of thousands. Let's dig in and take a look at Gmail's less-touted features for power users.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">10. Change Gmail's look entirely with themes.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmail_theme.png" width="300" height="152" class="right" align="right">Adam did the yeoman's work of compiling <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5093536/gmail-updates-its-look-adds-themes">screenshots and thumbnails of Gmail's new Themes</a>, accessible through a Settings tab, and one can see that they're more than just a font switch and background image. Gmail's themes cover a nice range of aesthetic choices, geekiness, cute-overload, elegant color tweaks, and, for those who put a lot of time in on the screen, dark-themed schemes. If you haven't checked them out yet, they're certainly worth a look, if only to give your eyes a rest from all the variants of light blue.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">9. Launch video and audio chats, no Skype required.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmail_vidchat.jpg" width="280" height="211" class="right" align="right">It's Windows-only at this point, and still requires a little browser plug-in, but it's surprising how little fanfare Gmail's native video chat application has received. It's comparable quality to most software-based solutions, it's got a full-screen mode, and, well, if the person's not all that intriguing, you can minimize them and get back to your email.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">8. Back up your email from any system.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmail_backup.jpg" width="300" height="127" class="right" align="right">Just because Google wants you to put your digital life in the cloud doesn't mean you can't have your own copy of your own messages and attachments. There are lots of ways to get your entire Gmail dump onto your desktop. We're currently into <a href="http://www.gmail-backup.com/">Gmail Backup</a>, which is graphical for Windows and command line for Linux and Mac OS X. You can also grab it with the command-line-based <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/geek-to-live--back-up-gmail-with-fetchmail-235207.php">Fetchmail</a>, grab them <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/backing-up-gmail-with-thunderbird-234717.php">via POP with Thunderbird</a>, or use the web-based <a href="http://www.stashmymail.com/">StashMyMail</a> for 99 cents, if you don't mind the third-party-ness of it. To back up another email account using Gmail's generous storage space, you can always BCC: your outgoing messages to a Gmail account to make sure you've always got an online searchable copy of your mail.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">7. See all the places where you're signed in, and remotely sign out.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmail_signouts.png" width="284" height="169" class="right" align="right">Friends' and significant others' computers, work, public terminals&mdash;people sign into Gmail from all kinds of places, and don't always remember to hit that privacy-ensuring "Sign Out" in the upper-right corner. At the very bottom of any Gmail inbox, though, is a text line showing where else the account is open, along with a list of sign-in times and IP addresses and a button that signs you out of everything but the browser you're in right then. No need to worry, then, that your friends' willpower will ever be tested by discovering you're still signed in on their system.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">6. Serve as a central, synchronized, smarter contact list.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmailcontacts.png" width="207" height="167" class="right" align="right">Used to be that Gmail put everyone you sent five emails to went into your contacts, but they've <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5066758/gmail-gives-you-more-control-of-your-contacts">wised up and created two lists</a>: Your true contacts, and those oft-mailed but not well-known folks into "Suggested" contacts. That makes Google a much nicer, cleaner place to sync your computers and devices from. Mac users can pull Google Contacts into their Address Book <a href="http://lifehacker.com/393855/enable-google-contact-sync-without-an-iphone-or-ipod-touch">with or without an iPhone</a>, Blackberry owners can <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/blackberry/sync.html">hook up too</a>, and fans of Thunderbird have <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/7307">got their own tool</a> as well. Oh, and the Google-centric Android platform does it too, of course.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">5. Consolidate all your email accounts.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmail_consolidate.jpg" width="300" height="158" class="right" align="right">Gmail eliminates the need to ever have to send one of those very late, apologetic "Don't check this email often" replies from your ancient accounts. Gina's explained how straightforward it is to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/376367/consolidate-multiple-email-addresses-with-gmail">consolidate multiple email addresses into Gmail</a>, with full importing of messages from any POP or IMAP-compliant account (almost all of them are) and the ability to keep sending emails from your old address, eliminating the need for mass pleas to update address books.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">4. Help friends find their own Gmail messages or bookmark your own.</h3> <p>"You honestly do <em>not</em> have my email explaining how to take care of my dogs and disable the alarm system? Okay, no, it's no big thing, Steve. Hit this link, it should take you to the right message: <code>http://mail.google.com/mail/#search/buster+alarm+code+Pedigree</code>" That kind of universal search link is pretty helpful, but the addresses of any email you open in Gmail are also permalinks for the account owner, meaning you can create lists of emails you need to get back to, bookmark an important thread in your browser favorites, and save them for any other purpose or list.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">3. Keep your Gmail account(s) on your desktop.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/top10_google_gadget.png" width="291" height="192" class="right" align="right">More than one of the Lifehacker editors had gotten used to keeping Gmail and Lifehacker's Google Apps email open in two browser tabs, clicking over when a new message hit the title bar. With the just-launched <a href="http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/gmailgadget.html">Google Desktop Gadget</a>, though, all the basic actions of email&mdash;read, star, label, delete, respond&mdash;can fit into a corner of your desktop. If you're good with Gmail's <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6594">keyboard shortcuts</a>, the gadget works with those, too, and can be opened in multiple instances for different accounts. Pretty neat stuff, but if it's not worth installing the whole <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a> suite for, check out the other ways our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5100778/how-do-you-get-new-gmail-notifications">readers get their Gmail notifications</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">2. Give you total search power.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmail_search.jpg" width="330" height="119" class="right" align="right">It's easy to forget that the company providing Gmail is, by and large, a search specialist, and has given its webmail app some serious search, filter, and organization tools. Don't waste time scrolling through page after page of your mom's email&mdash;find that one email she sent a few months back, with the attached JPEG file and mentioning that cat, Mr. Nibbles or Snibbles or whatnot--<code>from:Stacey after:2008/09/01 has:attachment (nibbles OR snibbles)</code>. You can start at learning the <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=7190">basic operators</a>, then take Adam's tips on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/hack-attack/build-advanced-gmail-filters-and-persistent-searches-276499.php">building advanced filters and persistent searches</a></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">1. Do much, much more with Gmail Labs experimental features.</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/top10_gmail_labs.jpg" width="315" height="255" class="right" align="right">It started out as a modest set of tweaks and small Oh Neat items, but Gmail's Labs section has become a powerhouse of email features. From Labs' increasingly-long list of tools, you can set up <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5066970/gmail-adds-canned-responses-for-quick-replies">canned responses for standard replies</a>, stop yourself from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5050323/gmail-labs-adds-forgotten-attachment-detector">forgetting attachments</a>, get your <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5069708/gmail-labs-adds-google-calendar-other-gadgets-to-sidebar">Google Calendar agenda</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5075107/remember-the-milk-gadget-puts-tasks-in-gmails-sidebar">Remember the Milk tasks</a>, get at all your various attachment types with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398216/set-up-quick-access-to-your-gmail-media">Quick Links</a>, and many, many more tweaks. Labs isn't particularly hidden away or obscure, but if you haven't taken the time to scroll down the list of options, you're almost certainly missing out on something that makes your webmail home a bit more comfortable.</p> <p>Those are our picks for ten tricks that Gmail pulls off without a lot of praise, but everyone uses their webmail differently. Let's hear your own hidden (or obvious) Gmail tricks and glad-hands in the comments.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ How to Raise Your Rent One Glass at a Time ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228505472430_3007176888_e355259cef.jpg" width="494" height="329" style="display:block;" /> Let's face it. The news is terrible. The economy, it's badness, the sheer scale and depth of it is enough to send anyone into a great depression. I've gotten to the point where I don't dare read the news. My New York Times alerts are the same every day. NYSE craters. Nikkei in midnight free-fall. There's no escape. Forget brokers and mortgage-backed derivatives, give me buddies and beer-backed bourbon. It's in times like these (sad, broke) that I strongly believe in making your own cheer. Back in the bust years I found that spreading goodwill and getting people together was the perfect emollient to era's hard times. I'm talking about throwing a "Rent Party." <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joelwashing/3007176888/">JoelWashing</a>.</i></p> <p><br clear="all"> Simply put, one throws a <a href="http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/harlem/parties.html">Rent Party</a> in order to pay the rent. It was a Harlem Renaissance tradition that died along with prohibition (and some say, because of it). Here's an excerpt on Rent Parties from <a href="http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/harlem/index.html">the Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>During the 1920s and 1930s (and even into the 1940s), such parties formed the backbone of Harlem nightlife, and became for many working people not only an enjoyable and affordable way to dance and socialize but also an economic necessity. For the reasonable admission price of between ten cents and a dollar, plus the cost of liquor and food, guests could dance, drink, flirt, and gamble, while the hosts collected enough money to pay the landlord for another month.</p> </blockquote> <p>So if you're having trouble paying rent, go for it.</p> <p>I can recommend Rent Parties for a few more reasons. Charities are having a terrible time getting donations right now. Nobody's taking tax breaks because everyone's losing money this year in the market. Donations are down umpteen percent at the same time that demand is rising for services that such charities provide. It's a vicious cycle.</p> <p>A Rent Party would do nicely to bring your friends into a small circle of do-gooders. Call up the charity you normally donate to and ask them if you can get friends together on their behalf. They'd love to come, help you spread the good word and pass the hat around for donations. Every buck counts. To maximize attendance, pitch it as a party first and make sure you talk up the talent. Sell the sizzle.</p> <p>I can also recommend Rent Parties for your friends who are away from family for the holidays. Last week I got an email from Gary, a Texan who did not go back to Ft. Worth for Thanksgiving. He roasted a turkey and invited everyone he knew to come by. While he didn't take donations for a charity, he's spreading goodwill for those of us too poor or too fed up to go home. I guess you could say he opened his house up a friendly soup kitchen to those of us too concerned about paying the rent.</p> <p>Last, we all need a shoulder to cry on. As the old adage goes, misery loves company. So if you're recently laid off, pissed off, or just plain grumpy, get on the phone and start calling your friends. There's never been a better time to let loose. While we're revisiting the less-desirable parts of the 30's on the markets, let's revisit the fun parts, too.</p> <p><i>Guest contributor <b><a href="http://dandelife.com/kga245/blog">Kelly Abbott</a></b>'s weekly post, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/ungeek-to-live/">Ungeek to Live</a>, highlights all the ways you get can stuff done without (gasp!) a computer.</i></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ KLS Mail Backs Up Your Browser, Email, and Contacts ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/kls-mail-backup.png" width="800" height="413" style="display:block;float:none;" />Windows only: Despite what its name would imply, free application KLS Mail Backup backs up popular Windows web browsers and address book apps in addition to email applications&mdash;including Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and Seamonkey; Windows Live Mail, Contacts, and Messenger; along with Windows Mail, Windows Contacts, and Internet Explorer. Backups are automatically zipped, can be stored locally or on a networked hard drive, and are kept under version control. Apart from the backing up, the application also restores any of your archived backups. According to the Download Squad post, it can also run off a portable device, so you can make and restore backups from your thumb drive. In short, if you're looking for a solid backup solution for your browser, email, or contacts app, KLS might be up your alley. KLS Mail Backup is free for personal use, Windows only.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.kls-soft.com/klsbackup/mailb_index.php">KLS Mail Backup</a> [via <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/12/05/kls-mail-backup-makes-email-browser-backups-a-snap/">Download Squad</a>]</div> ]]></description>

If you're sick of hearing about Firefox and the iPhone and Gmail and Chrome, you're in the right place. Let's take a look at the least hyped software that launched or saw great improvements in 2008, and give 'em the love they deserve. <i>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckroberts61/532216911/">ckroberts61</a>.</i></p> <p><br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Songbird</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/songbirdthumb.png" width="150" height="150" align="right" class="right"> The open-source, cross-platform music player <a href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a> was supposed to do for your tunes what Firefox did for your web browsing: free you from the claws of iTunes and offer extensibility and general awesomeness. Back in November, the first release candidate of Songbird <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5078386/first-look-at-songbird-10-aka-itunes-killer-aka-sloppy-mess">didn't quite deliver</a>, but the final 1.0 release this week <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5100579/songbird-10-release-official-fixes-bugs-plays-itunes-purchases">absolutely did</a>, now that the bird plays iTunes Store purchases and ironed out its major wrinkles.

Users have complained that the still-fetal Ubiquity prototype slows down Firefox, but the Quicksilver-like concept behind Ubiquity is way impressive.

			<title><![CDATA[ First Look at Opera 10 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/opera-10-alpha2_01.png" width="317" height="300">Windows/Mac/Linux: Opera released an alpha version of Opera 10 today, a first step toward the next major release of the popular cross-platform web browser. First and foremost, Opera 10 is looking to offer stiff competition with the blazing rendering engines in the upcoming Firefox release (Tracemonkey) and Google Chrome (V8) with an update to its rendering engine, Presto&mdash;which Opera claims offers a 30% speed boost over the previous version of the engine. But that's not all.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/opera-10-alpha_01.png" width="800" height="599" style="display:block;float:none;" />Opera 10 has also added a few new features and overall standards improvements that should make any Opera user smile&mdash;including inline spell-check, full HTML email support for Opera's built-in email client, and a perfect score on the <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid3 web standards test</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Passing Acid3</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/acid3-on-opera10.png" width="684" height="562" style="display:block;float:none;" /><br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Inline Spell-Check</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/opera10-misspell_01.png" width="216" height="194">Sure, Firefox had built-in spell-check since <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/firefox/firefox-2-officially-released-209905.php">its release in October of 2006</a>, but any Opera user whose been waiting patiently for this feature should be thrilled.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Full HTML Email</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/opera-rich-html.png" width="570" height="251" style="display:block;" /><br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Updated Dragonfly</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/dragonfly_01.png" width="800" height="317" style="display:block;float:none;" />Developers will be happy to see that Dragonfly&mdash;Opera's built-in tool for debugging web sites, similar to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug extension</a> in Firefox&mdash;has been updated with more and better features.</p> <p>Opera 10 is a free download for all platforms. Keep in mind that it's currently in alpha (the final release isn't likely to hit until somtime much later next year), meaning you should expect a bug or three. That said, if you give it a try, let's hear how you like it in the comments.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/">Opera 10</a></div> ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/fluidtunes.png" width="485" height="297" style="display:block;" /> Mac OS X only: Using your Mac's iSight camera to detect the hand gestures you make in front of it, free utility FluidTunes controls your iTunes library playback based on those motions. File this under "really cool but not sure I'd actually use it every day": you swipe your hand back and forth in the air in front of your Mac to move through your iTunes library in Cover Flow mode, and then swipe at a button to play a selected album. FluidTunes shows what you look like on your camera behind your album covers, so you can center your hand over buttons to press them. (It's dim, but it's there&mdash;in the screenshot above the user's hand is at the bottom of the screen.) While not touching the keyboard, mouse, or any other digital remote to play your music is amazing, you'll look like a flailing crazy person while you use FluidTunes.

			<title><![CDATA[ Boxee Updates, Adds Support for Netflix, Windows on the Way ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/boxee-netflix.png" width="800" height="449" style="display:block;float:none;" />Windows/Mac/Linux: Free Xbox Media Center (XBMC) spinoff boxee has updated with great news for Netflix lovers: The popular media center application now supports streaming Netflix Watch Instantly video to your boxee media center. There are, however, a couple of catches. First, the Netflix streaming only works on Macs (with Microsoft Silverlight installed), so Linux users are out of luck until Netflix begins supporting Linux. Second, those of you enjoying <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5057411/atv-usb-creator-loads-boxee-and-xbmc-on-apple-tv">boxee on an Apple TV</a> are also out of luck (for now) when it comes to Netflix streaming. Now for the good news. The boxee update also introduces a handful of great new feature improvements and bug fixes that everyone can enjoy, including:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/hulu-boxee.png" width="800" height="449" style="display:block;float:none;"><br></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>a new Hulu</strong> – looks more like hulu.com, enables you to login (so you can get your Hulu Queue), works faster, and playback should be greatly improved on Apple TV</li> <li><strong>a new YouTube</strong> – new look, as well as higher quality video playback. some of these YouTube clips look pretty good on your 46” LCD</li> <li><strong>a new CNN, Flickr, Picasa and Apple Movie Trailers</strong> – we’ve re-written all of these plug-ins to work faster and look better</li> <li><strong>Boston Globe’s The Big Picture</strong> – it’s a great photo-blog, which we really like, and thought could be pretty cool in a 10-foot experience. if you’ll like it we could bring much more of these type of services (let us know!)</li> <li><strong>integration with MTV Music</strong> – when you click on an album you’ll see a new option to let you watch music videos of the artist. check it out. MTV said they can give us higher quality videos, and we have a few more ideas for providing a great music video experience on boxee</li> <li><strong>theWB</strong> – on our quest to bring more TV content to boxee is the latest addition. it means shows like Buffy, Babylon5, Firefly, One Tree Hill and The O.C. are now available on boxee</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/netflix2-boxee.png" width="800" height="449" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> I've been playing around with the new boxee all morning, and it's a great update to the interface. If boxee has been buggy for you in the past, you may want to give this release another try, too&mdash;it features lots of behind the scenes code improvements as well.</p> <p>Finally, to Windows users wondering why they've been included on this download: boxee has also released a pre-alpha for the Windows crowd to a couple hundred of new testers. While that means it's not available to everyone yet, it hopefully will be very soon.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2008/12/04/boxee/">boxee &lt;3 Netflix</a> [boxee blog]<br> <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">boxee</a></div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ SkyDrive Upgrade Goes Live with 25GB of Space ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/skydrive_splash.jpg" width="514" height="253" style="display:block;" /><br> <a href="http://live.com">Windows Live</a>, intended to be a landing page for social activity and Microsoft's cloud-connected apps, is rolling out a host of redesigns and upgrades today, but none so exciting (to our eyes, anyways) as the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5094242/skydrive-will-upgrade-to-25gb-of-online-storage">anticipated</a> jump of the <a href="http://skydrive.live.com">SkyDrive</a> online storage service to 25GB capacity. As the Digital Inspiration blog <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/best-online-storage-live-skydrive/5771/">points out</a>, SkyDrive seems to be a central part of the Redmond giant's web ambitions, so it's not likely to go away or shrink. Aside from the raw upload/download capabilities, having a SkyDrive account gives you a few other cool abilities, which we'll detail below.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/skydrive_nosignup.jpg" width="362" height="120" class="right" align="right"><strong>No-sign-up-needed sharing:</strong> If you've used most any Microsoft service, you know their features are often linked to a drive to get more people signed into their apps and networks. Not so with SkyDrive, which offers a nice little checkbox for sending sharing links to any email address without requiring a Live sign-in.<br clear="all"></p> <p><strong>Lots of tools for photos:</strong> Tag yourself or friends Facebook-style in your photos, launch elegant pic-on-black-background slideshows from folders of pictures (your own or shared) that works on any browser (but supposedly better with Silverlight installed), order prints, and SkyDrive's thumbnails are nicely big and clear. Here's how photos are handled in SkyDrive's file browser:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/skydrive_photos.jpg" width="607" height="599" class="center" align="center"><br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/skydrive_zipped.jpg" width="194" height="191" class="left" align="left"><strong>Grab entire folders as single .zip files:</strong> This simple, helpful compression feature isn't entirely common amongst file-sharing/storage services. You can also drop photos right into your Live Photo Gallery, if that's how your roll.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/windowslive_contacts.jpg" width="440" height="233" class="left" align="left"><strong>Easy sharing and updates on contacts' files:</strong> Windows Live allows you to keep updated with what your friends on Live, Facebook, and LinkedIn are up to, and SkyDrive is no different. Your main SkyDrive page will let you know if any of your contacts have opened up a file for public sharing, and you can organize contacts into categories for easy group sharing&mdash;so everyone, for example, in "Project Team" can be sent your latest report at once, with one click.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/skydrive_gladinet.jpg" width="220" height="135" class="left" align="left"><strong>Mount SkyDrive on your desktop with Gladinet:</strong> As we <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5100226/gladinet-mounts-web-storage-apps-as-virtual-drives">detailed earlier this week</a>, Gladinet's free <a href="http://www.gladinet.com/p/download.htm">Cloud Desktop beta</a> allows you mount and access SkyDrive (and Picasa, Google Docs, and Amazon's S3) as if it were a plain network folder. Drag-and-drop access to 25GB of go-anywhere cloud space is surely a nifty thing.<br clear="all"></p> <p><strong>Still lacking&mdash;50MB file size limit:</strong> Amongst SkyDrive's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5064688/online-storage-feature+by+feature-comparison-chart">online storage peers</a>, 50MB isn't quite eye-opening, especially for a service that wants to be the hub of a burgeoning online network. Still, for photos, documents, and even most zipped-up MP3 albums, it's decent enough.</p> <p>SkyDrive requires a sign-up with <a href="http://live.com">Windows Live</a> for storing and sharing files. What do you think of the newly-expanded SkyDrive? Share your review in the comments.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://skydriveteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!977F793E846B3C96!12722.entry">SkyDrive: 25 GB of free online storage</a> [Windows Live SkyDrive team blog]</div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Best New and Improved Software of 2008 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/bestof2008_01.png" width="494" height="290" style="display:block;" /> <iframe src="http://digg.com/api/diggthis.php?u=http://digg.com/software/Lifehacker_Best_New_and_Improved_Software_of_2008" align="right" frameborder="0" height="82" scrolling="no" width="55"></iframe> Mobile phone operating systems and a reheated web browser war: that's how we'll recall the year 2008 when it comes to software. From brand new to revamped browsers and mobile platforms and apps, 2008's been good to technophiles who like their data in the cloud and accessible wherever they are. Let's take a look back at this year in software, and some of the best new and improved applications, web services, and mobile platforms that were born in 2008. Looking back at the last 12 months, these are the apps that get a gold foil-wrapped chocolate coin from us this year. <i>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gaetanlee/1947414336/">Gaetan Lee</a>.</i></p> <p><br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Firefox 3</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/firefox3-sq-thumb_01.png" width="135" height="135" align="right" class="right"> Not only did you swoon over the release of Firefox 3 because of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/392160/top-10-firefox-3-features">the "AwesomeBar" and the rest of the "Had no idea I needed this but now I love it!" features</a> it offers, but because the launch itself was a grass-roots community-driven effort towards making software history. Indeed, on June 17th of this year, the makers of Firefox <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2008-07-02.html">set a new Guinness World Record for most software downloads in a given day</a>, at more than eight million downloads of the new browser iteration in 24 hours. If you haven't dug into the advanced functionality Firefox has to offer, check out our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/396312/power-users-guide-to-firefox-3">power user's guide to Firefox 3</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Google Chrome</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/thumb160x_gchrome.png" width="135" height="135">While Mozillians and Firefox users celebrated across the globe over the summer, no one knew that search powerhouse Google was in the software development lab cooking up their own lean, mean browsing machine that would forsake all of the fox's bells and whistles (and extensibility) to run Javascript-based applications lightning-fast. On September 2nd, Google released the first beta of <a href="http://google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, their new web browser which they hope you'll make your window to the web and all its apps. Our own in-house <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5055406/browser-speed-tests-the-compiled-up+to+date-results">browser speed tests show that Chrome is indeed speedy</a>, and we're seeing a significant uptake on Chrome usage by Lifehacker readers. (Last month's browser breakdown for Lifehacker readers was 62% Firefox, 22% IE, 8% Safari, and 6% Chrome. Not bad for a browser that's been out only a few months.) For more Chrome goodness, see our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5045904/the-power-users-guide-to-google-chrome">power user's guide to Google Chrome</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">iPhone 2.0 and the App Store</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/iphone20-sq-thumb_01.png" width="135" height="135" align="right" class="right"> Yeah, yeah, the iPhone launched in 2007, but this year the iPhone 2.0 software and the new iPhone 3G model with a faster data plan and GPS came out to hype almost as big as the original iPhone launch. The combination of an operating system that finally ran third-party apps officially plus pinpointy GPS goodness set the bar for what users can expect to get from the next generation of smartphone with a fast internet connection, full-on browser, and spot-on location-awareness. Plus, dozens of the apps available for the phone are free. At first, we were <a href="http://lifehacker.com/395171/how-your-location+aware-iphone-will-change-your-life">in</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398338/iphone-20-gets-you-laid-and-more">love</a>. Later, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398658/why-youre-better-off-avoiding-the-iphone">we had our doubts</a>. The iPhone 2.0 launch did start to show some of the cracks in the Apple armor&mdash;several of the earliest versions of the software were crash and freeze-prone, requiring many users to uninstall apps and reset their phone software to fix maddening keyboard delays and application crashes. Meanwhile, Apple's approval-only App Store left a few applications out in the cold. Still, the iPhone 2.0 software created a compelling mobile platform and app marketing campaign that made Aunt Bertha really want to try that Neil Diamond song out on Shazam.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">iPhone 2.0 Jailbreak Utilities and Apps</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/cydia-thumb.png" width="135" height="135" align="right" class="right"> What with the App Store limitations and Apple's insistence on ruling over what you can and cannot do on your phone, it's not surprising the enthusiastic "jailbreak" community soldiered on this year, continuing to offer installers and non-Apple-approved applications for your iPhone even in the face of the mainstream iTunes App Store. We take our hats off to these intrepid hackers, who offer such lovely functionality as the ability to SSH into, theme, and download video clips to your phone; if you haven't jailbroken your iPhone or iPod touch, here are a few of our picks of best <a href="http://lifehacker.com/400148/iphone-20-jailbreak-apps-you-cant-find-in-the-itunes-store">iPhone 2.0 jailbreak apps you can't find in the iTunes Store</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Google Android</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/android-logo-sq.png" width="135" height="135"> Google's answer to Apple's proprietary iPhone hardware and software came in the form of their very own touch mobile phone operating system, Android, which launched this past October. Unlike the iPhone, this new mobile platform is open source and will run on various handsets going forward. Right now Android's first release is only available on the HTC G1 handset; you can see our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5064117/a-hands+on-first-look-at-google-android">hands-on first look at Google Android running on the G1 here</a>. As an iPhone user frustrated by limited apps, crashiness, and lack of copy and paste, Android is like a breath of fresh air. Even though the mobile OS is still very new, its open-source nature has led to hundreds of new apps. See our pick of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5075332/best-android-apps-to-boost-your-mobile-productivity-so-far">best Android apps to boost your mobile productivity</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Digsby</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/digsby-logo_01.png" width="135" height="135" align="right" class="right"> One of the few software apps on this list that's not open source or made by a ginormous company, new instant messenger client Digsby took chatters by storm with its ability to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/354345/consolidate-im-email-and-social-networking-with-digsby">consolidate your IM, email, and social networking in one place</a>. Even though the Digsby beta only went public in February, by April it was already <a href="http://lifehacker.com/375391/five-best-instant-messengers">one of our readers' top five favorite instant messaging tools</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">XBMC and Forks</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/xbmc-logo-sq_01.png" width="135" height="135"> We were really late to the Xbox Media Center (XBMC) party when we showed up last year and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/transform-your-classic-xbox-into-a-killer-media-center-299809.php">installed it on our old classic Xbox</a>, but since then we've been hooked on this rich, open-source media center. Luckily, just because those old black boxes are becoming obselete doesn't mean the XBMC software project has died off. Just the opposite: XBMC has forked into several neat branches that run on various hardware platforms so you can enjoy the same media center goodness without hacking an old Xbox. Check out a few launches from various factions of XBMC developers this past year that have warmed our hearts:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5051874/xbmc-atlantis-beta-1-released-for-all-platforms">XBMC 'Atlantis' Beta 1 Released for All Platforms</a></li> <li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5095241/plex-7-adds-itunes-and-iphoto-support-and-more">Plex 7 for Mac Adds iTunes and iPhoto Support and More</a></li> <li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/396382/boxee-is-xbmc-with-newer-look-and-social-flair">Boxee Is XBMC with Newer Look and Social Flair</a></li> </ul> <br clear="all"> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex and Hardy Heron</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/hardyheron-logo.png" width="135" height="135" align="right" class="right"> Another year, another TWO Ubuntu releases, and they just keep getting better. You have to love the free, open source operating system that manages multiple releases within the span of a year&mdash;something Apple and Microsoft, companies you pay hundreds of dollars to for the privilege of using their software, can't pull off. If you've tried Linux on your desktop before and killed the partition in frustration only to slink back to Windows, it's time to give it another go. This year we thought <a href="http://lifehacker.com/383769/hardy-heron-makes-linux-worth-another-look">version 8.04 Hardy Heron made Linux worth another look</a>; the follow-up, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5070747/ubuntu-810-released-includes-bootable-usb-maker">version 8.10 Intrepid Ibex is even better</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Gmail Labs, Gadgets, and Themes</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/thumb160x_thumb160x_thumb160x_thumb160x_smallish_smallish_smallish_smallish_gmailenvelope.png" width="135" height="135"> Our favorite web application on the internet, Gmail, continues to burn down barns and rip up the competition with continual iteration and feature adds. This year, Gmail added a "Labs" section to your account, a safe way for power users to enable "experimental" power features to their email while keeping everyone else's safe from harm. Truthfully, when I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/395211/gmail-gets-13-experimental-new-features">attended the Google press event announcing Gmail Labs</a> back in June, I had my doubts about whether or not the featureset would ever expand beyond the initial 13, and if it would go beyond eye-candy games like Snakey to, you know, actually useful stuff. Turns out it did. Six months later, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5052060/what-gmail-labs-features-do-you-have-enabled">ten more Gmail Labs features</a> are available in your account, including a super-useful Gadgets feature that lets third parties embed their apps into your inbox. (Like <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5101139/bitly-offers-in+gmail-url-shortening-gadget">Bit.ly</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5084502/add-your-basecamp-projects-to-gmail">Basecamp</a>.) Later, Gmail launched <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5093536/gmail-updates-its-look-adds-themes">themes</a> as well as <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5100649/gmail-google-desktop-gadget-now-available">a Google Desktop gadget</a>. In the midst of all this, the Gmail security team took the time <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html">to respond to a breach</a> that several users had experienced and blogged about online. Clearly there's someone home at Gmail; this is a rapidly-evolving product that any webapp developer should use as an example on how to iterate quickly.<br clear="all"></p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Honorable Mentions</h3> <p>Making best-of-year lists is always difficult because you risk leaving off really deserving items. At least two that go in our honorable mentions bin are the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5042312/ubiquity-prototype-offers-a-natural-language-web-command-line">Firefox keyboard interface prototype Ubiquity</a>, and photo-sharing site <a href="http://lifehacker.com/377598/flickr-adds-video">Flickr's launch of short video clips</a> in April.</p> <p>Now, you tell us which one of these apps impressed you the most in the year two thousand and eight.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/1160637.js"> </script><noscript><a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1160637/">Which new or improved app impressed you the most in 2008?</a><br> <span style="font-size:9px;">( <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com">polls</a>)</span></noscript></p> <p>If you can't get enough of best-of lists, hop into the time machine and see our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/lifehacker-top-10/top-10-new-and-improved-apps-of-2007-332617.php">top 10 new and improved apps of 2007</a>, and our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/best-of-2006/geek-to-live--the-best-apps-of-2006-221920.php">best apps of 2006</a> and of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/geek-to-live-best-apps-of-2005-144388.php">2005</a>.</p> <p>Anything you would have included on this list that we left out?

			<title><![CDATA[ DVDCoach Express Burns Video Files to Playable DVDs ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/dvdcoach.png" width="494" height="302" style="display:block;" />Windows only: Free application DVDCoach burns any video file (like DivX or Xvid videos you've downloaded off BitTorrent) to a playable DVD. The application provides a simple front-end for converting the files to the proper format (using the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5058888/five-best-media-converters">very popular media conversion tool</a> ffmpeg) and burning the results to a DVD. DVDCoach Express doesn't have many advanced features&mdash;for example, you can't create custom DVD menus&mdash;but what it lacks in features it makes up for in simplicity. Just drag and drop the videos you want to burn to DVD into the application, set the few preferences available (PAL or NTSC, aspect ratio, and quality), and get burning. If you're looking for a more robust feature set, check out <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5082262/how-to-burn-any-video-file-to-a-playable-video-dvd">how to burn any video file to a playable video DVD</a> using other free apps.

			<title><![CDATA[ MyCorporation Founds Your Company for Free This Week Only ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/mycorporation-logo.png" width="198" height="221" align="right" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" /> In support of small business and entrepreneurship, the normally-$149 MyCorporation service&mdash;which files all the paperwork you need to found your new company (LLC or corporation)&mdash;is free all this week, until December 5th. The MyCorporation service sounds familiar because we mentioned their last free promotion on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5083444/found-your-company-with-mycorporation-free-today-only">November 11th</a>, which went so well, the company decided to do it again. We haven't used MyCorporation to found a corporation or LLC ourselves, but at least <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5083444/found-your-company-with-mycorporation-free-today-only?cpage=2&sort=asc#c8892269">one satisfied reader did</a>. Happily a company rep explains what exactly you get when you use MyCorporation to found your company.</p> <p>Several readers questioned why you'd need MyCorporation to file your LLC or incorporation paperwork when it's something you can do yourself and expressed concern about getting upsold on other products they don't want; others said that they wouldn't trust MyCorporation because it's made by Intuit, the makers of finance software Quicken and Quickbooks. Note also that state filing fees <i>do</i> apply even if you take advantage of this offer, so it's not completely free.</p> <p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5083444/found-your-company-with-mycorporation-free-today-only?cpage=2&sort=asc">NaldoFudge</a>, a reader who appears to be from or know a whole lot about MyCorporation, says:</p> <blockquote><p>I wanted to answer some of the questions/concerns mentioned in this thread: </p> <p>1. Yes, anyone can draft and file any documents directly with state government agencies. The value of the service is that you don't have to do any research on what and how to file, and you minimize the risk of your doc/filing getting rejected at the state by using a service that specializes in these filings. Also, MyCorp doesn't just file the corp/llc for you &mdash; they check the company name for availability (filing formation docs with an unavailable name is one of the most common reasons for rejection of documents when you do it yourself); they provide customized and editable internal operating documents to you (bylaws for corporations and operating agreements for LLCs) &mdash; bylaws are a legal requirement for corporations. They also automatically provide you with customized stock or membership certificates. It's a valuable service even for the normal $149.00 fee &mdash; so there's nothing to lose when it's free. </p> <p>2. The state fees have to be paid whether you do it yourself or use a service like MyCorp. The state fees MyCorp charges are completely accurate and current. [...]</p> <p>3. MyCorp is indeed a business, not a nonprofit organization, and the way they make money on such a deal is by customers purchasing optional products and services with fees. But such products and services are, as indicated, *optional* &mdash; no additional purchase is required to get the free service, so it is not a bait-and-switch scheme. Hundreds of customers got the free service on the Free for a Day without buying anything additional. But note that the optional offerings are valuable services for those who do want to use them. </p> <p>4. For those who have had issues with other Intuit products, please note that MyCorp is not a software product &mdash; MyCorp is a service company where real, live human beings process everything you order and provide excellent customer service after you file for as long as you need assistance. Hope this info is useful. Take care everybody!</p></blockquote> <p>Let us know if you pull the trigger and start your company this week using MyCorporation. The $149 fee waiver is only in effect until Friday, December 5th. Any company founders out there want to offer advice or insight into taking the leap? Do so in the comments. <div class="related"><a href="http://mycorporation.com/freeweek/">Free Incorporation, Free LLC Formation Services&mdash;MyCorporation</a></div> </p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Songbird 1.0 Release Official, Fixes Bugs, Plays iTunes Purchases ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/songbird-bowie.png" width="800" height="516" style="display:block;float:none;" />Windows/Mac/Linux: The long-awaited cross-platform media player Songbird officially reaches its 1.0 release today. The open-source application&mdash;built on the same platform as Firefox&mdash;promises to bring exciting new innovations to a software jukebox market that has become arguably quite stale. Like Firefox, Songbird is extensible, meaning that users can customize the look, feel, and features of Songbird to their heart's content. We took you on a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5078386/first-look-at-songbird-10-aka-itunes-killer-aka-sloppy-mess">screenshot tour of Songbird</a> last month, and from a feature standpoint, not much has changed. From a functionality standpoint, Songbird has gotten much, <em>much</em> better.</p> <p>The first release candidate had a lot to be excited about, but unfortunately it was <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5078386/first-look-at-songbird-10-aka-itunes-killer-aka-sloppy-mess">rife with errors in my tests</a>. The official 1.0 release fixes most if not all of the bugs I came across in my initial review, which is very promising. The footprint is still a little unwieldy, weighing in at just over 100MB of RAM on the Windows PC I tested it on.</p> <p>The default installation also suggests installing a new add-on (new in the sense that it wasn't suggested in the release candidate I tested) called QuickTime Playback that supports playing back music you've purchased from the iTunes Music Store&mdash;a killer feature that, in conjunction with the iPod sync add-on, would allow even the hardcore iTunes user to switch.</p> <p>If you want a closer look at what you can do with Songbird and what sets it apart from your stock media player, check out <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5078386/first-look-at-songbird-10-aka-itunes-killer-aka-sloppy-mess">our previous screenshot tour</a> and <a href="http://getsongbird.com/customize/">Songbird's demo screencasts</a>. Whether you're a regular Songbird user or you're trying it out for the first time today, share your Songbird experience in the comments.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a></div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ NexusFile Helps You Speed Through File Management Tasks ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/2008-12-01_212959.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="662" height="387" style="display:block;float:none;" /><br> Windows only: NexusFile is a feature-rich portable Windows Explorer alternative. Weighing in at just under 3MB, NexusFile easily replaces a host of other applications. There is a basic file renamer, an ftp client, and a file splitter/joiner. You can export saved file lists in a variety of formats, assign favorite folders, browser folders in tabs and in a dual pane view, and compare folders. NexusFile has keyboard shortcuts for every imaginable need from jumping to the root folder to executing command line instructions and everything in between. If you have a disdain for your mouse, you won't be reminded of it while working in NexusFile. If you're on friendly terms with your mouse you aren't forgotten, the GUI of NexusFile is very well laid out. Have a set of working folders your access frequently? Assign them while you work to the vertical bar of numbers in between the dual panes. They'll be right at your fingertips from then on. The rest of the interface follows with a similar degree of thoughtfulness. If you need Unicode support for your daily file management, you're covered with NexusFile. If the extremely high contrast color scheme is too much for you, there is a detailed color scheme designer under <code>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Color</code>. For another feature rich and portable explorer alternative, check out <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5100050/cubic-explorer-saves-your-file-management-sessions#c9183132">Cubic Explorer</a>. For more alterantives make sure to look over the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/399155/five-best-alternative-file-managers">Five Best Alternative File Managers</a>. NexusFile is freeware, Windows only. <em>Thanks <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5100050/cubic-explorer-saves-your-file-management-sessions#c9183132">g915</a>!</em></p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.xiles.net/">NexusFile</a></div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Freckle Tracks Time and Clients Quickly and Simply ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/freckle_splash.jpg" width="494" height="200" style="display:block;" /><br> Just-released webapp Freckle isn't, as it proclaims, a whole-cloth re-thinking of time tracking, billing, and client management, but it is refreshingly light, agile, and easy to get into. Like Remember the Milk and other text-aware apps, it doesn't require learning an entirely new input system, but knows that "1h35m" and "1:35" mean the same thing. The AJAX-saturated interface requires very few refreshes, and the smart tagging system works well for those who tend to "organize" on the fly. The fleshed-out version of Freckle isn't free, but they do offer 30-day trials on any account type, along with a very limited free account. Walk through screenshots and analysis of using Freckle for organizing billable hours and client work below.</p> <p>First off, the pricing and plans:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/freckle_plans.jpg" class="center" width="752" height="477" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>Once you've signed up with an account, free or otherwise, you'll probably want to add your <code><em>username</em>.letsfreckle.com</code> address to your bookmark toolbar. Your basic dashboard should load fairly quick, especially once the images are cached, and it's where you get everything done in three tab-able boxes. Enter the time however you'd like in the first box&mdash;it rounds up based on a project-specific time increment setting you can configure. The second box is the name of the project you're entering time for, which, in my free-only account, is simply "Project." The last box is the action tag for the time spent, and it drops down, WordPress-style, to help you recycle action names. Add a * to the end of the tag, and it's listed as non-billable.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/freckle_basic.jpg" class="center" width="804" height="456" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>The "Pulse" tab, accessed from a nicely unobtrusive right-hand menu bar, isn't a full report, but gives you an at-a-glance look at what you've been doing today, yesterday, and in recent history in text and graph, and a link to configure budgets on any particular project. If you had something other than a free account, and shared your Freckle use with other workers, you could see what they were up to also.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/freckle_pulse.jpg" class="center" width="724" height="326" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>The actual reports are more straight-forward, and include a link to download and print as a CSV file.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/freckle_report.jpg" class="center" width="726" height="403" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>From glancing at the developer's <a href="http://letsfreckle.com/blog">blog</a> and <a href="http://letsfreckle.com/manifesto/">manifesto</a>, we can assume there's more to come in the features and usability departments, as Freckle is a very new release, if pretty nicely polished.</p> <p>What do you look for in a time tracking app, whether desktop or web based? What features or functions put one over another? Tell us how you score the field in the comments.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://letsfreckle.com/">Freckle</a></div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Gmail Google Desktop Gadget Now Available ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gmailgoogledesktopgadget.png" width="304" height="329" /> Windows only (running Google Desktop): If you want access to your Gmail on your desktop (literally) without running a full-blown email client, now you can download the Gmail Google Desktop gadget. You'll need the free Google Desktop software installed first, and then you can dock your Gmail gadget to the desktop to read, search, send, and star messages. The Gmail gadget offers the same keyboard shortcuts that web-based Gmail offers, too. You can even open multiple instances of the gadget and log each into a different Gmail account. The only complaint about the gadget? It doesn't play a sound when new mail arrives. (Though you may thank Google for that one.) The Gmail gadget is a free download and works in conjunction with Google Desktop 5 for Windows only. <div class="related"><a href="http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/gmailgadget.html">Gmail Google Gadget</a> [via <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/gmail-on-your-desktop.html">Official Gmail Blog</a>]</div> </p> ]]></description>

Install Helvetireader in Firefox with the Greasemonkey extension, Opera, a <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/">Chromium nightly build</a>, or Safari with Greasekit.

			<title><![CDATA[ Joost Streams TV, Movies to Your iPhone ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/joost0.png" width="318" height="459" />iPhone/iPod touch only: Television and movie streaming service Joost officially finds its way to the iPhone and iPod touch. Joost <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/joost/screenshot-tour-watch-tv-over-the-internet-with-joost-253455.php">started out as a desktop application</a>, was quickly overshadowed by online offerings like Hulu, then recently <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5062691/joosts-web+based-face-goes-live">moved to the web</a> in an attempt to keep up with the competition. With its new iPhone/iPod touch application, Joost is back in the drivers seat, beating the likes of Hulu to Apple's popular mobile devices. Joost still doesn't offer as much popular content as Hulu, but its 46,000 videos&mdash;which include 400 TV series, 1,200 movies and short films, and 18,000 music videos&mdash;are a pretty good start.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/photo.jpg" width="480" height="320" /><br clear="all" />The player can be buggy at times, but overall it's an impressive offering. Joost is a free download from the iTunes App Store.<br /> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/photo-1.jpg" width="480" height="320" /></p> <div class="related"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295977505&mt=8">Joost</a> [iTunes App Store via <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5100018/joost-video-streaming-iphone-app-makes-us-dream-of-hulu">Gizmodo</a>]</div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Gladinet Mounts Web Storage Apps as Virtual Drives ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gladinet_splash2.jpg" width="494" height="200" style="display:block;" /><br> Windows only: Free utility Gladinet Cloud Desktop removes the web interfaces from Google Docs, Picasa Web Albums, Windows Live SkyDrive and Amazon S3 Storage, mounting them instead as folders you can add, remove, or open documents from. Gladinet hides most of the back-end technology that pulls it off, asking you only for a username and password. Once mounted, it's easy to, say, open a Google Docs file in your local copy of Microsoft Word, or directly add pictures to folders in your Picasa or SkyDrive accounts. Read on for a look at how Gladinet works, along with a 10-minute video that explains more of its features.</p> <p>After <a href="http://www.gladinet.com/p/index.htm">grabbing the beta download</a>, installing and launching Gladinet Cloud Desktop, you'll see a fairly simple "start page," which either opens Windows Explorer directly to your virtual webapp drives ("Explore My Gladinet Drive") or mounts a new one ("Mount Disk Storage or Web Storage As Virtual Directory").</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gladinet1.jpg" class="center" width="516" height="336" style="display:block;"></p> <p>Choose to mount a new drive, and you'll be asked to choose a service, provide login details and give it a name.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gladinet5.jpg" class="center" width="427" height="336" style="display:block;"></p> <p>Once you mount a web service for the first time, you won't need to type in usernames and passwords again, as your credentials are stored in a "Safe Card," which you can manage and delete in a separate dialog. It might take a minute or more for Gladinet to make the connection and mount your virtual drive, and the app doesn't make it clear that it's gone through successfully.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gladinet4.jpg" width="195" height="155" class="right" align="right">If everything does go through, however, you can head to your "Computer" section, or hit the "Explore" choice on the Gladinet start page, and see your pictures, documents, and other files listed under a new shared drive, labeled "Z:" and named "resources." Opening a word document might fail at first&mdash;it did for me with Word 2007&mdash;but the files are otherwise there for you to move and manage. Some services, like Picasa, are finicky about what you can put where, but Gladinet shows an explanatory progress dialog that details what went wrong.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gladinet6.jpg" width="190" height="199" class="left" align="left">Uploading a picture to the Picasa drive, for example, doesn't fly, unless you create a new folder and leave it there&mdash;which makes sense, because Picasa Web Albums is organized by, well, albums. But creating a new "Just a Test" folder and dropping a screenshot there worked, as evidenced by the Picasa Web Albums screenshot to the left. SkyDrive and Google Docs worked similarly; I don't, unfortunately, have an S3 account to check out, but I'd presume it has fewer restrictions than any of the others, being a storage-based app.</p> <p>Gladinet keeps itself in your system tray while running, and closing it un-mounts your "resources" drive with all your app connections. From its right-click system tray menu, you can add and delete app-drives and Safe Card credentials, and create logins that allow you to run Google Calendar, Gmail, the <a href="http://www.thinkfree.com/">ThinkFree suite</a> and other webapps in stand-alone windows&mdash;nothing you can't do with <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Prism">Prism</a> or Google Gears, though.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/12/gladinet7.jpg" class="center" width="507" height="263" style="display:block;"></p> <p>All in all, Gladinet seems like a pretty handy utility for someone who trades a lot of files between their cloud and desktop spaces. I'd assume Gladinet intends to expand its coverage of webapps, though they could limit this free version to the four listed here and keep others for its "Standard" version, which adds remote desktop and file-grabbing tools.</p> <p>For those looking for a more in-depth tour around Gladinet, the makers have released this 10-minute introductory tour video:</p> <p><object width="494" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/879e7x2OA5Y&hl=en&fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/879e7x2OA5Y&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="494" height="344" align="center"></object></p> <p>What do you think of Gladinet's spin on web-as-desktop? Share your take in the comments.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.gladinet.com/p/index.htm">Gladinet</a> [via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/access_files_stored_online_via.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>]</div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Cubic Explorer Saves Your File Management Sessions ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/2008-11-30_022619.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="494" height="369" style="display:block;" />Windows only: Cubic Explorer is a robust Windows Explorer replacement. Among the features power users have come to expect from Explorer alternatives you'll find tabbed windows, bookmarking, bread crumb navigation, file previews, detailed file searching and quick search via extension filtering. One area of oversight is the lack of dual pane browsing, but the tab interface is snappy enough that the lack of panes can be forgiven. The feature which really shines is the ability to save sessions. If you use Cubic Explorer on multiple machines you can save your preferences for each unique setup: work, home, laptops, etc. Cubic Explore is packaged both in an installer and in a zip file for portable use. For other Explorer alternatives, check out the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/399155/five-best-alternative-file-managers">five best alternative file managers</a>. Cubic Explorer is freeware, Windows only.</p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.cubicreality.com/cubicexplorer/download/">Cubic Explorer</a> [via <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/11/28/cubic-explorer-is-a-highly-customizable-portable-file-manager/">Download Squad</a>]</div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Five Best CD and DVD Burning Tools ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/burn-cds-dvds-hive.png" width="494" height="271" style="display:block;" /><iframe src="http://digg.com/api/diggthis.php?u=http://digg.com/tech_news/Five_Best_CD_and_DVD_Burning_Tools" align="right" frameborder="0" height="82" scrolling="no" width="55"></iframe>The internet has made it easier than ever to share media and data with friends, family, and co-workers, but that doesn't mean burning your own CDs and DVDs is a thing of the past. Blank optical discs are dirt cheap, they work virtually everywhere, and if you bought your computer sometime in the last 5 years, chances are you've got the necessary hardware to quickly burn anything you want to a disc in just a few minutes. Now all you need is the right authoring tools. Earlier this week we asked you to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5098925/best-cd-and-dvd-burning-tools">share your favorite CD and DVD burning tools</a>, and today we're back with the five most popular answers. Keep reading for a closer look at your favorites, then cast a vote for the burning tool you like best. <i>Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thetrial/497932831/">the trial</a></i>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">InfraRecorder (Windows)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/infrarecorder-hive.png" class="center" width="728" height="390" style="display:block;float:none;"><a href="http://infrarecorder.org/">InfraRecorder</a> is a free, open-source CD and DVD burning application for Windows. InfraRecorder covers almost any of your optical needs, including support for burning disc images, copying discs, creating quick audio CDs, writing video DVDs, erasing discs, and more. InfraRecorder is lightweight and decidedly bloat-free, and it's even available as a portable app you can carry on your thumb drive to satisfy your burning needs no matter where you are.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">ImgBurn (Windows/Linux)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/imgburn-hive.png" class="center" width="614" height="409" style="display:block;"><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> is a free CD and DVD Swiss Army knife for Windows (it also runs on Linux under Wine). ImgBurn can write data from a variety of formats, burns audio CDs, ISOs, and video DVDs, including regular DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray DVD. As an added bonus, ImgBurn can read a disc to an image on your hard drive and build a disc image from files on your computer. It's fast, easy to use, and doesn't cost a penny. Incidentally, this app is still actively developed by the same developer who built the once very popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd_decrypter">DVD Decrypter</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">K3b (Linux)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/k3b.png" class="center" width="600" height="405" style="display:block;"><a href="http://k3b.plainblack.com/">K3b</a> (which stands for KDE Burn Baby Burn) is an open-source burning application for Linux. Like the rest, K3b supports common tasks like burning audio CDs, data discs, disc images and disc copying. For movie lovers, K3b can even rip your DVDs to your hard drive in either of the popular DivX or Xvid formats. If you're running Linux, K3b is easily one of the most popular options for burning anything to your optical discs.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">CDBurnerXP (Windows)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/cdburnerxp.png" class="center" width="554" height="393" style="display:block;"><a href="http://cdburnerxp.se/">CDBurnerXP</a> is a free authoring software for Windows. Despite its name, CDBurnerXP works with Windows Vista, 2000, 2003 Server, and XP; it also burns to CD <em>and</em> DVD, including HD and Blu-ray. It's got a small footprint, and like most of the other options, burns data discs, audio CDs, and ISOs without a hitch. CDBurnerXP is light, fast, and free, requires .NET 3.5.</p> <h3 style="font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;">Nero (Windows/Linux)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/nero-9.png" class="center" width="600" height="416" style="display:block;"><a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/store-nero9.html">Nero 9</a> is a shareware optical media authoring tool for Windows that's long been the go-to favorite for robust, user-friendly CD and DVD burning for a price. Detractors complain that Nero is slow and bloated (and the 370MB download, 2GB free space requirement, and <em>long</em> install time doesn't inspire confidence to the contrary), but fans argue that you can install only what you need from Nero and that its simplicity more than makes up for the bloat. Nero 9 is an $80 shareware (grab the trial <a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/downloads-nero9-trial.php">here</a>), Windows only, requires .NET 3.0. Linux users can give <a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/linux3.html">Nero Linux</a> a go for $25.</p> <hr> Now that you've seen the best, it's time to vote for your favorite authoring tool.<br> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/1152445.js"> </script><noscript><a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1152445/">Which Is the Best CD and DVD Burning Tool?</a><br> <span style="font-size:9px;">( <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com">polls</a>)</span></noscript> <p>This week's honorable mentions go out to Windows-only applications <a href="http://www.burnaware.com/burnaware_free.html">BurnAware Free</a> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5042196/burnaware-free-burns-cds-dvds-and-blu+ray">original post</a>) and <a href="http://www2.ashampoo.com/webcache/html/1/product_2_1810__.htm">Ashampoo</a> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5070552/ashampoo-burning-studio-free-handles-all-your-burning-needs">original post</a>), followed by Linux-only <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/brasero/">Brasero</a> (the Gnome counterpart to the KDE-focused K3b) and Mac OS X-only <a href="http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/toast/titanium/overview.html">Toast</a>.

You can rename files, substitute some or all of the file name, apply numbers and lettering, swap extensions, append with time and date stamps, rename based on image EXIF data and audio ID3 data, and all that just scratches the surface. Concerned that somewhere in the labyrinth of check and text boxes you may have misstepped? The quick preview function is a fast and handy feature to help you sidestep any mishaps. After Bulk Rename Utility came reader recommended in the comments of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5074500/ken-rename-helps-you-rename-on-the-go">Ken Rename</a>, it has become a completely indispensable part of my file management work flow. Bulk Rename is freeware, Windows only.<em>Thanks <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5074500/ken-rename-helps-you-rename-on-the-go?t=8688925#viewcomments">IOStreamCTO</a>!</em></p> <div class="related"><a href="http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Screenshots.php">Bulk Rename Utility</a></div> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Dozens of iPhone Apps Free on Black Friday ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/2008-11-28_125622.jpg" width="158" height="84" align="left" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>iPhone only: Dozens of iPhone application are free from the iTunes App Store. While the main App Store page makes absolutely no mention of the promotion, by using the application indexer at AppShopper you can search through the free applications. Some of the applications are silly, some look rather useful, but you can't look a free application in the pixels and complain. In addition, AppShopper has a price change monitor, so you can keep an eye on applications which may not be free but have be discounted heavily for Black Friday. If you find any diamonds in the rough, share with your fellow readers in the comments below.<Div class="related"><a href="http://appshopper.com/prices/free">Free iPhone Applications</a> [AppShopper]</div> </p> ]]></description>
