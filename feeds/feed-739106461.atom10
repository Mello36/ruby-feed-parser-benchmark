<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.whatisleft.org/lookie_here/">
&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a fever on the morning of the race, and disregarding the meniscus issue I developed on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sacca/2675083835/"&gt;Tour de Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, I am happy to report that I was somehow able to power through and finish my first official &lt;a href="http://www.vineman.com/triathlon.htm"&gt;Ironman distance triathlon&lt;/a&gt; on August 2nd. (I did an &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sacca/statuses/845953969"&gt;impromptu Ironman&lt;/a&gt; myself on June 28th, but there is nothing like the expectation and excitement of the real thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2.4 mile swim was a relative breeze considering that when I started this training in November I couldn't make it 10 lengths of the pool without sucking wind. In fact, the 74 degree water served to keep my temperature down and I felt fresh and confident coming in to the first transition.&lt;a href="http://www.whatisleft.org/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/25/chris_and_obama_at_the_ironman_fini.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=402,height=568,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"&gt;&lt;img width="175" height="247" border="0" alt="Chris_and_obama_at_the_ironman_fini" title="Chris_and_obama_at_the_ironman_fini" src="http://www.whatisleft.org/lookie_here/images/2008/08/25/chris_and_obama_at_the_ironman_fini.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 112 mile bike, my goal was to keep a steady pace early and not go out too fast. I managed the effort solely by my heart rate and just stayed down on my aero bars. The first 60 miles went very smoothly and my pace was surprisingly quick for a guy who was blowing his nose and taking throat lozenges the whole time. However, by mile 75, the 98 degree Sonoma heat had kicked in and I found myself on the side of the road tossing cookies. I puked again at 85, and one more time for good measure at 95. Sheer competitive stupidity allowed me to get back on my rig and maintain a swift pace. However, needless to say, by the time I got to the run transition, I was a mess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood there in the searing hot parking lot of Windsor High School, with Minnie and my parents shouting encouragement from the sidelines. I felt completely detached from my body, a mere close-up observer to an athlete's agony. I came back into the present and put my head down on the bike rack for a minute, pausing to remind myself of why I was doing this and how hard I had trained. Just a marathon to go. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I resolved to just get out onto the course. There would be more than
enough time to think all this through if I could get a few miles away
from there. A couple of loving hugs later, my legs were scuffing the
gravel of a winding wine country lane. I never did feel any better than
absolutely awful on that run. But the three loop course was littered
with people who were undoubtedly in much worse shape, so I considered
myself lucky and just kept moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 13:07:25, I crossed the finish line, much to the delight of the
crowd who had been loving my Obama jersey all day. (Note: while wearing
Obama schwag is guaranteed to draw fervent support from spectators,
expect to be required to dispense at least a thousand fist bumps.) It's
hard to describe the temporarily restorative impact of that finishing
tape slapping your belly. I was elated, relieved, proud, and downright
chipper. My eyes welled up with tears as my mom, dad, Minnie and her
mom all embraced me in the chute. I was done.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a half hour, the idiocy of the day's undertaking finally
caught up with me and I found myself in a heap on the lawn of the high
school, shaking. Every cell hurt. By midnight, my body finally decided
it would accept some food and liquid and, by 2:30am, my smile had
returned. I was an Ironman, even if all I could ingest was ginger ale
and some crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who made this possible for me. My mom and
dad were such troopers for coming out from Buffalo to cheer me on with
my mom defying her doctor's orders to avoid that heat and with my dad nursing his own knee injury aggravated by accompanying me on some training runs
back in my hometown. The entire Ingersoll clan was so supportive ever
since this crazy plan was hatched, organizing rides in SF and LA with
Marion, Ruth, and Grandma Sarah even making it up to my race. The coaches
from &lt;a href="http://www.ironteam.net/about/"&gt;Ironteam&lt;/a&gt; were an invaluable resource without whom I could not have
begun to complete this distance, and I'm deeply flattered that my
Ironteam buddies Josh and Robin Boxer came up from the city to support
me. Kevin Coady was my sage and guru, humoring my endless nutrition and
gear queries and Dr. Taylor Rabbetz gave me the treatment and
confidence to overcome what I thought was a hopeless knee. Moreover,
the Twitter and FriendFeed communities were there along the way sending
me good wishes in real-time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, I need to thank my training partner and amazing friend,
Minnie Ingersoll. From initially recruiting me into this
ultra-endurance realm of questionable judgment, to keeping me motivated
at almost every discouraging turn, I owe so much of my result to her.
Preparing for a race of this length requires weekend after weekend of
countless hours in the saddle and pounding sand. Min kept lazy me
honest and didn't let me slack on the work I needed to put in. She has
&lt;a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntgsf/IronSisterMinnie"&gt;her own Ironman&lt;/a&gt; coming up in Louisville, KY this weekend, and I am sure
she too will see all the hard work pay off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, will I do another one? Hmm. For now, doubtful. I am
afraid I will just find myself racing against my time from the last
race. Nevertheless, you all know that I am an endorphin addict and I am
sure I will find a new challenge soon. Stay tuned...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am still floored by the outpouring of remedies and good wishes the Twitter community offered me in the 48 hours leading up to my Ironman tomorrow. I was already depressed by tearing up my knee and not being able to work out at all for the last four weeks. But, when I got sick and developed a nasty fever, I have to say, I was losing hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update is that my fever has broken. I still sound and look like I have an incontinent squirrel living in my sinus cavities. However, with no fever, my doctor has cleared me to hit the starting line tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I didn't recap many of the cures and treatments the Twitter and the FriendFeed folks offered both publicly and privately. I am grateful to all of you, but must say that some of you frankly scared me. Though, I guess &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sacca/statuses/874042199"&gt;my Twitter&lt;/a&gt; begged for lunacy in the replies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have an Ironman in 48 hours and am still running a fever. Hit me with
your best cold remedies. (Forget science. Give me myth and hype.)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my, you did not disappoint in a few buckets. First, the herbs, vegetables, vitamins, supplements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@chriscoit -- &lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Matcha green tea is always good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;@olivermarks &lt;em&gt;-- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;boil onion and garlic, drink. Tons of vitamin c 1000mg per hour.&lt;br /&gt;@davidbadash -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Echinacea. Lots of it. With Vitamin C,
&amp;amp; a ton of fruit juice - the real stuff. Fresh. And those Zinc
drops, &amp;amp; aspirin/advil &amp;amp; sleep&lt;br /&gt;@oudiantebi -- Once heard fron a really old lady that Apple cider vinegar works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;@joshspear -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;go to whole foods and get this shit called 'Cold Snap'... I'm telling you, whatever is in there, it WORKS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@[direct] --zinc gluconate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@timoreilly -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Try black elderberry and plum flower brand gan mao ling&lt;br /&gt;@joseph_di_p -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;chicken soup with lots of garlic&lt;br /&gt;@rachelannyes -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;try Red Root extract. wow, it's bitter.&lt;br /&gt;@wordstrumpet -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;tons of Vitamin C, Airborne, and Cold-Eze.&amp;nbsp; The combo works every time for me.&amp;nbsp; I've also heard good things about garlic.&lt;br /&gt;@stevemann -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;zicam zinc works really well but u need to take it religiously. C won't do any good imho. Only for prevention. Chicken soup&lt;br /&gt;FF/@tad -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;Raw garlic, but you shoulda used that a few days ago.&amp;nbsp; Not gonna help.&lt;br /&gt;FF/@johnpiercy -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;Echinchea&lt;br /&gt;FF/@ha3rvey -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;Find a Thai restaurant and have as much Tom Kha Gai as you can manage.&lt;br /&gt;FF/@sfwahine -&lt;em&gt;- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;the Wellness Formula tablets from Source Naturals

ginger in 12 mug-steep w/ hot water 10 min, remove ginger, add 2T
honey. lather rince repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Not going to lie to you. A couple hundred bucks at Whole Foods later, I tried most of these.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;The next group of remedies are the alcohol-based ones. These might be some of my favorite examples oral tradition:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@runvmc -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Shot of 151 in a cup of hot tea. Drink it down and get under a pile of blankets. Wake up good as new.&lt;br /&gt;@svalleydiva -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;this may sound strange but lemon, honey, brandy mixed with some hot tea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@bettinatizzy -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Tequila is the Mexican way; steambaths is the Oaxacan way&lt;br /&gt;@hol_kinz -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;best remedy: a shot (or two) of jack daniels.&lt;br /&gt;@larsz -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;perhaps elder flower and elder berry.. or
try cocktail of two doses of antihistamin, 10mg codeine and 500 mg ASA,
kills symptoms 12hrs &lt;em&gt;[Codeine?! Hmm. Haven't read the rules, but there has to be something in there about dosing codeine...]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@tywbooth&lt;em&gt; -- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Scotch. The alcohol kills germs....Or at least that's what I'd like to believe&lt;br /&gt;@[direct] -- &lt;/span&gt;equal parts theraflu and bourbon every 4 to 6 hours&lt;br /&gt;@[direct] -- &lt;em&gt;[redacted] &lt;/em&gt;once got through a sick week of SXSW with constant shots of tequila&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@orions55 -- Kelly Kid says you can drink away a fever---divide your body weight 10 and drink that many beers.&lt;br /&gt;FF/@isthistupid -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;much orange juice and soup as you can get down in
an evening, drink two hot totties (hot tea w/ honey, lemon, and
whiskey) before bed, and sleep at least 10 hours. Courtesy of my
great-grandmother&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;FF/@stretta -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;Guinness &lt;em&gt;[I lived in Ireland, and of course they swear by this over there.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;One presumably sane and wise person told me I was stupid for still considering racing:&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@tweetipfh -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;fever : listen to your body &amp;amp; your torn meniscus &amp;amp; decide if pushing through 2 the other side is worth it...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;But, then again, a couple of you essentially called me a pussy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@dickc -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;you ironman people are always complaining.
&amp;quot;Oh, i have to run a marathon now, oh my head hurts, oh i have a 103
fever&amp;quot;.

&lt;p&gt;A few of you suggested physical undertakings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@[direct] -- Try sleeping, instead of Twittering :) &lt;em&gt;[I am not sure how you Twitter, but it really isn't that draining for me.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@amitp -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;maybe you should sleep instead of twittering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@chrishedgecock -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;steam room. 1hr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@atulacharya -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Hot shower and a good night's sleep works for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@parislemon -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;cut off your arm, you'll forget all about that cold &lt;em&gt;[Yeah, but it might slow down my already pathetic swim]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite all of the wisdom offered above, there were a few that stood out from the rest:&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;@stanlee86 -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;Use your proton canons to help you! &lt;em&gt;[Ummm...okay.

right, a final check of my bags and I am off to Napa for the race.
Thanks for all of the encouragement and good wishes. By the way, while
I am not racing for a cause (other than personal survival) a couple of
dear friends are raising money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society
for their races. If you are at all inspired by the idiocy of Ironman
events, considering giving to &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntgsf/IronSisterMinnie"&gt;Minnie Ingersoll's fundraising campaign here&lt;/a&gt; as she preps to hammer out Ironman Louisville later this month. And, if you would like to encourage &lt;a href="http://www.virgintriathlete.com/"&gt;Crystal Engligh, author of Virgin Triathlete&lt;/a&gt;, as she attempts her first Olympic distance, &lt;a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/sf/pactri08/cenglish"&gt;donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, everyone. I will try to Twitter from the course! (Well, from
everywhere but the water. Still haven't figured that one out yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.whatisleft.org/lookie_here/">&lt;p&gt;I can't tell you how thrilled I am that the guys from Omnisio, one of my portfolio companies, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=2J_iwL4szts"&gt;will be joining the team over at YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Junee, Julian Frumar, and Simon Ratner are some of the most legitimate entrepreneurs I have ever met. I marveled at their ability to hack up surprisingly robust technology while creating intuitive and simply easy user experiences. Too often, teams excel in one area but lack any talent in the other, either the software is technically superb, or the UI just flows so naturally. Rarely can a company pull off both. From day one, the Omnisio guys demonstrated true coding chops plus an admirable understanding of, and dedication to, creating a service that users understand, enjoy, and are eager to share with others.&#xD;
 &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, as has become the hallmark of YCombinator companies, these guys were the epitome of hungry entrepreneurs. Choosing to keep the company lean and agile, they coded from their apartment breaking only intermittently for the occasional &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/22256533@N07/2661796517/in/set-72157606128076502/"&gt;game of kickball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/2hv4"&gt;jam sessions&lt;/a&gt; like at the MSFT summer party. (Does that make these guys literal rock stars?) In any event, most of their time was spent tirelessly incorporating user feedback into the product and developing features at a fascinating rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, as an Omnisio user, and a huge fan of YouTube, I wish the Omnisio guys best of luck as Googlers, and I look forward to the innovation that I am sure will result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.whatisleft.org/lookie_here/">&lt;p&gt;Virtual goods have been described, researched, and debated to a tiring level. The use of such goods for identity expression and goal attainment is clear. Beyond that, gifting of virtual goods allows for ingratiating oneself to friends while similarly demonstrating status and capability. While these are certainly predictable and time-tested motivations for inspiring user action, I am surprised no one has ever built into virtual gift markets a feedback loop of unmitigated self-interest. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, if I were to send someone a Facebook gift, they receive a cute little icon to display on their page and maybe I do or do not get public credit in the community for sending it. All told, not a lot of value has been shifted around and thus, it is no surprise that they don't sell more of these little $1 doodads. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, imagine that every time I bought a virtual gift for someone, I was simultaneously entered into a drawing to actually win a real one of those items. Send someone a virtual jetski and a real one may just show up in your driveway! This could work for a wide range of items including the most obvious jewelry, cars, and cash value type prizes. However, it could also work for sports and music items. Users give each other gifts from their favorite teams and and bands and suddenly they have won tickets or memorabilia. Maybe for certain prizes, the recipient shares in the winnings. The permutations are countless. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I actually believe that the underlying "prize" doesn't even need to have much value. The web sometimes forgets how much people still love to receive snail mail. None of us enjoys bills and junk. But, oh how we enjoy finding a padded envelope containing something for us. Even if it truly just a token, prizes in any form excite us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing who is going to make this happen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.whatisleft.org/lookie_here/">
&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's New York Times featured a piece entitled &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/health/03well.html"&gt;&amp;quot;Experts Revive Debate over Cellphones and Cancer&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which illustrates that all it takes to overturn inscrutable science conducted over hundreds of entirely conclusive studies is a Larry King appearance by three surgeons with PR agents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article clearly states the unwavering conclusion of the science community: &amp;quot;Cellphones emit non-ionizing radiation, waves of energy that are too weak to break chemical bonds or to set off the DNA damage known to cause cancer. There is no known biological mechanism to explain how non-ionizing radiation might lead to cancer.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should be end of story. However, the theater of modern sensationalist journalism demands that baseless superstition be granted airtime sufficient to provoke fear and needless confusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story continues, &amp;quot;But researchers who have raised concerns say that just because science can’t explain the mechanism doesn’t mean one doesn’t exist.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try swapping out &amp;quot;the mechanism&amp;quot; and replacing it with &amp;quot;Santa Claus&amp;quot; to see the wondrous immaturity of this logic. I feel like I am on an elementary school bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;u&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/u&gt;, Gore pointed out this ceaseless and deceiving proclivity of newspapers&amp;nbsp; to cover thoroughly debunked myth in the pandering charade of balance and fairness. He cited researchers who randomly sampled 928 peer-reviewed articles dealing with climate change and found that exactly zero percent were in doubt as to the causes of global warming. Yet, reviewing a random sample of 636 climate articles appearing in the popular press during essentially the same time period, the study found a staggering 53% expressed concrete doubt as to the cause of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This continuing practice is reprehensible and its ubiquity among otherwise revered media outlets is disheartening. The NYT unceremoniously flushes countless public and private studies that have invariably demonstrated the lack of causal linkage between phones and cancer all because some junior producer at Larry King decides to prey upon America's obsessive morbidity and technological paranoia by clumsily stuffing wireless fear-mongering queries into a &amp;quot;Tell us in eight commercial breaks worth of insensitive and exploitative detail how Ted Kennedy is dying&amp;quot; segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to the NYT for perpetuating our national epidemic of stupidity, apprehensive delusion, and steadfast denial of the scientific method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if I needed one more reason to only read blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.whatisleft.org/lookie_here/">
&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, my portfolio company &lt;a href="www.auctomatic.com"&gt;Auctomatic&lt;/a&gt; announced their sale to Canadian acquirer Live Current Media. There are so many things I could type after working with the founders this past year, countless lessons learned. However, typing from the back of a cab in Los Angeles on an EV-DO connection, I figure I have sufficient battery for just one real message -- thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Kulveer and Harjeet Taggar for being the most prototypical examples of entrepreneurial hunger I have seen. When I met these guys during my annual visits to Oxford, they couldn't write a line of code. Never did they seem to let that dim their prospects of being web startup guys. Instead, they just bubbled with an enviable energy and drive and never hesitated to do whatever it took. They are wicked sharp yet instinctively recognize and humbly learn from mistakes without slowing a step. They and their other founders lived in the same room from which they coded. Sleep was rare and there was certainly nothing sexy about their startup existence, but their belief in their mission was unwavering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to co-founder Patrick Collison, and his brother John, for making the accomplishments of my youth seem downright inane by comparison. These guys, 19 and 17 respectively, write new operating systems in their spare time and were the jockeys behind the guts of what makes Auctomatic special. I loved that I couldn't take the Auctomatics to a bar for a company meeting. I also admire that despite being off-scale geniuses, both of the Collisons were such likable guys with great attitudes and balanced lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston over at &lt;a href="www.ycombinator.com"&gt;YCombinator&lt;/a&gt;
for taking a chance on the Taggars. Never before had YC admitted
non-coders. But Paul and Jessica struck a deal agreeing to let these
two guys participate in YC if they committed to learn to hack. I think
both sides were pleased with the outcome. More importantly though, Paul
and Jessica are the most effective startup coaches and investors in the
world right now. Their religion of focusing relentlessly on user
experiences and staying lean and engineering-driven are helping change
the face of the entire startup realm in the Valley and the Auctomatics
benefited immeasurably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to those along the way who gave a helping hand to these guys.
I am grateful to people like Evan Williams who gave this ragtag group a
place from which to work until they found an apartment and helped them
chew on some of their biggest decisions. Paul Buchheit was incredibly
helpful when it came to scaling their infrastructure, going so far as
to buy servers for them without any formal arrangements in place. The
team at Live Current Media, including Geoff Hampson, Jonathan Ehrlich,
and Mark Melville,&amp;nbsp; really understands the Auctomatic vision and
clearly can see what these guys are capable of accomplishing. That
makes me happy. I am even thankful for the other companies that spent
time with the us looking to acquire Auctomatic. Though we obviously
didn't get a deal done with these other folks, it was great to be
reminded of how small Silicon Valley really is and what a pleasure it
is to do business here compared to other more mercenary markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all else, thanks to everyone involved for giving me the
opportunity to rediscover that my true passion is for working with
startups. When I left Google, many publicly and privately told me I was
crazy to do so, and I certainly left some money on the table there.
Yet, working with companies like Auctomatic, I find I wake up with so
much vigor, thrilled by the prospects of what challenges the day has in
store. It is hard to ask for much more out of a career than that. So,
one more time, on my last shred of battery power, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
