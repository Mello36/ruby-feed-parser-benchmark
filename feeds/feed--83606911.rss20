<title>Christoph Niemann&apos;s illustrated coffee notes</title>

<link>http://niemann.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/coffee/index.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I like coffee so much that I have tea for breakfast: The first cup of the day in particular is so good that I’m afraid I won’t be able to properly appreciate it when I am half-asleep. Therefore, I celebrate it two hours later when I am fully conscious.</p> <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/12/11/niemann.html" title="permanent link to this entry">#</a>]]></description>

<title>Charge Tee</title>



<link>http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/12/03/chargetee.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://simplebits.com/shop/"><img src="http://simplebits.com/img/chargetee-sm.jpg" alt="Charge Tee" class="thumb" /></a>It&#8217;s been awhile since we designed a t-shirt, and today we&#8217;re happy to announce the fresh-off-the-presses and just-in-time-for-the-holidays <strong><a href="http://simplebits.com/shop/">Charge Tee</a></strong>: a simple black battery icon screen-printed on an athletic grey Tri-Blend shirt from American Apparel. The Tri-Blend is the softest, most comfortable shirt I&#8217;ve owned. And you&#8217;ll love it too. Wear it to the gym, coffeeshop, pub&#8212;or wherever you recharge.</p>

<p>The shirts (like previous designs) were printed by <a href="http://acmeprints.com/">Acme Prints</a> in Arizona, and will be hand-packed by myself, Meagan, or anyone else we can coax into helping. </p>]]></description>

<title>Jonathan Hoefler on 16th Century pixel fonts</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The pixel will never go away entirely, but its finite universe of digital watches and winking highway signs is contracting fast. It’s likely that the pixel’s final and most enduring role will be a shabby one, serving as an out-of-touch visual cliché to connote 'the digital age.'</p> <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/11/21/hoefler.html" title="permanent link to this entry">#</a>]]></description>

<title>New at the Iconshoppe: Square Dance</title>



<link>http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/11/13/squaredance.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Last month, we launched <a href="http://www.iconshoppe.com/disco/">Disco</a>, and today we're happy to announce the second installment of the <a href="http://www.iconshoppe.com/families/ballroom/">Ballroom Family</a> of <strong>stock web icons</strong> over at the <a href="http://iconshoppe.com/">IconShoppe</a>. It's called <strong><a href="http://iconshoppe.com/square-dance/">Square Dance</a></strong>, and it's a simple little set of rounded-<em>square</em> icons that come in 7 colors, 3 sizes and 2 formats (<abbr>GIF</abbr> and <abbr>PNG</abbr>). And just like Disco, it's also reasonably priced at just thirty-nine bucks.</p>

<div class="photo static"><span><a href="http://iconshoppe.com/square-dance/"><img src="http://simplebits.com/img/squaredance-sample.gif" alt="Square Dance icons sample" /></a></span></div>

<p>I've been meaning to put more time into stocking the shelves of the 'Shoppe for a while now, and <a href="http://meaganfisher.com/">Meagan</a> has been handling the meticulous color/format production of these new sets, with more to come.</p>]]></description>

<title>What&apos;s new in Coda 1.6</title>
<link>http://www.panic.com/coda/releasenotes.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[A few months ago I switched from BBEdit to Coda for fulltime development work. I'm a happy camper for the most part (largely because of it's integrated local/server syncing). This new version touts a nice new plug-in system to extend the editor. <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/11/12/coda16.html" title="permanent link to this entry">#</a>]]></description>

<title>Tokyo Express</title>



<link>http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/11/12/tokyo.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I returned from Tokyo on Monday. I gave a talk at the <a href="http://east08.webdirections.org/">Web Directions East</a> conference. I've never had a simultaneous translation of a presentation before. I hope it went OK. I'll be forever grateful to <a href="http://www.johnfallsopp.com/">John Allsopp</a>, Satoshi Kukichi and the rest of the <abbr>WDE</abbr> team for inviting me to speak, being incredibly gracious hosts and generally being awesome people. I'll never get tired of traveling to faraway places, where (without fail) the quality of people in this industry inspire, impress and humble me. I feel lucky.</p>

<p>I don't think I'll travel that distance again without the rest of my family.</p>

<p>I'll never forget walking through customs after spending the entire Election Day in the air. <abbr>CNN</abbr> was on in the airport lobby. 'Barrack Obama Elected President of the United States' it said. Twenty seconds later, John McCain started his concession speech. Relief after 14 hours of  nail-biting anticipation.</p>

<p>I took a lot of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/sets/72157608682769728/">photos</a>. I tried packing as much into a few days as possible. I was amazed by the <em>giganticness</em> of the city. I caught a view of the cityscape at night, at the top of the hotel where <cite>Lost in Translation</cite> was filmed. They wanted a $20 cover charge, so we left.</p>

<p>I loved that every train station in Tokyo has it's own unique short little melody (<a href="http://hisaai-hp.hp.infoseek.co.jp/JREast/index_eg.html">hear them all</a>). I love how this aids accessibility with audio. I'm thinking we need more unique audible melodies for events that happen on the web or desktop. I was also impressed with the grooved sidewalk path found throughout the entire city, which would direct a blind person from station to station, uninterrupted.</p>

<p>I probably didn't bow enough.</p>

<p>I sang <cite>Don't Stop Believing</cite> in a karaoke bar in Shinjuku along with friends old and new. I've never sang karaoke before. I had the best doughnut I've had in my life in Harajuku, at <a href="http://www.kilian-nakamura.com/blog-english/index.php/tamadepa-new-interactive-shop-makes-kids-love-tamagotchi-even-more/">Tamagotchi Donuts</a>. I was amazed by the depth of the character culture in Japan. It permeates everything and everyone -- not just for kids, but a part of general communication throughout the city.</p>

<p>I tried the eel (unagi) and 'chicken knuckles', but was less adventurous with the raw horsemeat. I loved the simplicity of the food in Japan. I have a new favorite snack in '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri">onigiri</a>', a triangle of sushi rice, seaweed, and (in my case) teriyaki-soaked seaweed inside. I'll have to hunt for those here at home.</p>

<p>I learned two Japanese phrases. I should've learned more. </p>]]></description>
