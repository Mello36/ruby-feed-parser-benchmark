			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to title this post &#8220;Atlanta Startup Weekend 2 Brings New Skribit Feature&#8221; but then I went through my <a href="http://skribit.com" title="Skribit - Blog Topic Suggestion Application">Skribit</a> account and saw that there are a lot of suggestions asking me Skribit-related questions, so I&#8217;ll devote this post to it. First, Atlanta Startup Weekend 2 went down this weekend at Georgia Tech&#8217;s <a href="http://atdc.org/" title="GT ATDC">Advanced Technology Development Center</a>, where I also happen to spend some of my time doing Skribit stuff as <a href="http://blog.weatherby.net" title="Lance Weatherby">Skribit&#8217;s amazing advisor</a> works out of there. Unlike <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/10/startup-weekend-atl-and-my-idea" title="Startup Weekend ATL and My Idea">the first Atlanta Startup Weekend</a> which birthed <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/23/what-is-skribit" title="What is Skribit?">Skribit</a>, this one ended up creating several projects.</p>
<h4>Atlanta Startup Weekend 2</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/7217305@N07/3011219313/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/3011219313_ab74fd8303.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Great coverage of the weekend can be found at <a href="http://amromousa.com/2008/11/09/atlanta-startup-weekend-2-asw2/" title="Atlanta Startup Weekend 2">Amro Mousa&#8217;s blog</a> as well as the <a href="http://atlanta2.startupweekend.com/?p=121" title="Atlanta Startup Weekend 2 Status Updates">official ASW2 blog</a>. Skribit Co-Founder Calvin Yu and I kind of cheated a bit and worked on Skribit instead of working on one of the ASW2 projects. Rather than doing regular administrative tasks and working on closing Skribit <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/" rel="nofollow">Lighthouse</a> tickets, we decided to focus on churning out one new feature. After having spotted many sites using static side tabs to link to lightbox windows and forms, we did some research. They are a great way of engaging users unobtrusively without taking up much of the website&#8217;s screen real estate. So we went off and built this (now live on my site) on Saturday:</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_skribit_feature_asw2_1200.jpg" title="New Skribit Feature Developed During Atlanta Startup Weekend 2"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_skribit_feature_asw2.jpg" alt="New Skribit Feature Developed During Atlanta Startup Weekend 2"/></a></div>
<p>It has all of the abilities of the regular sidebar widget, which <a href="http://skribit.com/blog/2008/10/27/test-our-new-widget/" title="Skribit.com Blog - Test Our New Widget">was also recently updated</a>, of listing popular suggestions, the ability to vote on them as well as submitting a suggestion, but also has some great potential for expansion. It is only on a few sites for now until we add a few things and fix others.</p>
<h4>Skribit Update</h4>
<p>For the past year, Skribit has been chugging along. While Calvin and I haven&#8217;t been able to put as much time as we would have liked into Skribit, with his full-time job and with school keeping me busy, we have remained motivated and held weekly meetings at our favorite coffee shop to plan out the next stages and develop.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls/2767840833/" title="Octane Coffee Cappuccino"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/octane_coffee_mba.jpg" alt="Octane Cappuccino"/></a></div>
<p>Aside from development tasks, I have <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/05/20/startup-riot-recap" title="Startup Riot Recap">pitched Skribit at Startup Riot</a>, talked about Skribit at the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/20/recap-ttivanguard-generation-techs-conference" title="Recap: TTI/Vanguard Generation Techs conference">TTI/Vanguard conference in Italy</a> over the summer and talked with everyone from accomplished entrepreneurs to investors about Skribit. Needless to say, I&#8217;ve learned a lot in the last year. </p>
<p><strong>Let me be the first to say that I graduate in a mere 33 days and will be working for Skribit full-time upon graduation.</strong> Aside from holding the Co-Founder title I will be doing product manager, community manager and front-end developer duties (until I learn enough about Ruby on Rails to put in some controller work.. I have a few Ruby books I need to plow through). That&#8217;s <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/26/thoughts-on-startups" title="Thoughts on Startups">one of the reasons I love startups</a>. I won&#8217;t be chained to doing the same mundane task everyday, but will be able to wear many different hats. The second best part about working for myself/Skribit is that I can tell my recently graduated friends, who rub their $80,000 salaries in my face, that my work commute is about 10 feet to a couch, clothes are optional and Froot Loops are always on tap.</p>
<p>For those of you not quite familiar with it, Skribit helps bloggers discover topics to write about from both their own readers as well as suggestions on Skribit.com that they can add. Suggestions can be voted on by readers to gauge interest. That&#8217;s what Skribit does now. The only issue with that arrives if your website or blog doesn&#8217;t have a particularly large audience and you don&#8217;t receive many or any suggestions. In the near future we hope that several key updates from our product roadmap will make this a thing of the past.</p>
<p>We already have Skribit groups up, although they aren&#8217;t linked to just yet, allowing bloggers to join say the &#8220;tech&#8221; group and easily find things to write about as suggested to the entire group. Users will also be able to find suggestions by browsing the site by tags or by full-text queries of topics that interest them and even being alerted of new suggestions that match interests they have noted.</p>
<p>But the real McCoy is when Skribit will be able to automatically suggest things for individual bloggers to write about. I can&#8217;t disclose the inner workings of this but it involves analyzing reader activities, related users and blogs and using that data to identify trends that can aid in discovering topics and put an end to blogger&#8217;s block. That is the end goal and we are in the process of paving a road to that goal.</p>
<h4>Monetizing Skribit</h4>
<p>The current state of the US economy has made it painfully clear that Skribit will have to produce revenues quickly to stay afloat. Fortunately, recessions are great times to run a startup as I&#8217;ve read about in countless articles on the Hacker News homepage in recent months. Skribit has 3 streams of income planned. The first is simply having paid &#8216;Pro&#8217; accounts, aptly named the freemium model. We plan on launching the first iteration of Pro accounts somewhere around January. A Pro account will run $24.95 a year and offer features supporting multi-author blogs, running Skribit on multiple blogs, suggestion moderation and more. </p>
<p>Taking into account that most web apps like Flickr only have a few percent of their entire user base paying for Pro accounts, we are well aware that Skribit will not be able to rely on only that income stream. Instead, it is more along the lines of proof that users value Skribit and are willing to pay; something that makes potential investors feel warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>At the moment Skribit is serving up a few million pageviews per month. As such, putting advertisements on select pages is an obvious choice for a second stream of income. However, the real revenue will come from a model that, of course, my lawyers have told me not to talk about until things are more ironed out. I will say that a) it solves a problem, b) larger entities will pay to solve that problem and c) bloggers will actually enjoy putting it to use. <small>*further market research pending</small></p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>I am extremely eager about getting out of Georgia Tech and working on something I am passionate about. This means I will be remaining in Atlanta for an indefinite amount of time. That and I <em>can&#8217;t</em> move; the 75+ mbps fiber Internet connection in my apartment is keeping me here. </p>
<p>The next few weeks will be filled with papers, projects, exams and then finals, so blog posts will be sporadic.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts on Skribit?</strong>  Thanks to all of the Skribit suggestions that spurred this post. Combined, there were 1,227 votes on those suggestions.</p>

<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_unboxing_1200.jpg" title="New MacBook Pro Unboxing"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_unboxing.jpg" alt="New MacBook Pro Unboxing"/></a></div>
<p>Before I go any further, let me state that this won&#8217;t be a definitive review of any sort. If you love technology like I do, you already know tons about this laptop. If not, here is some catch-up reading: <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/10/27/tuaw-review-macbook-pro-late-2008/">TUAW&#8217;s review</a>, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/10/24/apples_unibody_macbook_pro_an_in_depth_review_with_video.html">Apple Insider&#8217;s review</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/2008-macbookpro-review.ars">ArsTechnica&#8217;s review</a>, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review">Gizmodo&#8217;s review</a>, <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/10/17/macbook-pro-review/">TAB&#8217;s review</a>.. and you get the idea.</p>
<h4>No Firewire 400, DVI?</h4>
<p>There has been quite a bit of noise around Apple&#8217;s decision to ditch FW400 in favor of FW800, and to move to DisplayPort (mini at that) instead of DVI. My thoughts: <strong>good decision Apple</strong>. They&#8217;re trying to push the industry into the right direction by making bold moves to force users to adopt the latest tech. First off, FW800 is backwards compatible with FW400 - all you need is an adapter, if you really still use FW400 devices. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_macbookpro_ports_1200.jpg" title="MacBook Pro ports"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_macbookpro_ports.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro ports"/></a></div>
<p>Second, DisplayPort is going to replace DVI anyway so why not start now? </p>
<ul>
<li>DisplayPort can provide full digital audio in the same cable (like HDMI but DisplayPort has more bandwidth and isn&#8217;t based on legacy CRT raster-scan architecture)</li>
<li>Not that it matters when running to your LCD panel, but DisplayPort is designed to run for up to ~50 feet, compared to DVI&#8217;s ~15 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong>, Apple does make you pay for the mini DisplayPort adapters. It cost me $30 for the Mini-DP to DVI adapter, and it&#8217;ll cost $100 for the Mini-DP to Dual-Link DVI adapter if you have a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/06/27/review-dell-30-inch-lcd-display" title="Review: Dell 30-inch LCD Display">30-inch display requiring a dual-link connection</a>.</p>
<h4>Easy Battery &#038; Drive Access</h4>
<p>All you have to do is push a flap and a nice battery/drive bay cover pops open. From there, only 1 screw secures the hard drive, with 4 torx screws used as pegs to keep the drive suspended in a rubber-padded drive cage of sorts. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_intel_x25m_ssd_install_1200.jpg" title="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD) Installed in an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_intel_x25m_ssd_install.jpg" alt="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD) Installed in an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"/></a><br/><small>Note: This is not the drive that comes with the MBP.</small></div>
<p>The battery is just a pull tab away from swapping it out. Unlike the old MacBook Pro batteries, the new battery does not contain the battery level meter anymore. That is now incorporated into the left side of the laptop. While this is nice, I can imagine it is a slight drawback for people that travel with 2 or 3 batteries, as I did with my last MacBook Pro. Now users won&#8217;t know how much charge each battery has until they put it in the laptop. </p>
<h4>Graphics Performance</h4>
<p>The 2.53GHz MacBook Pro I&#8217;m using has 512MB of RAM for the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT GPUs onboard. Why does a laptop need two graphics chips? The 9600M GT is used for better performance with graphics-intensive applications and games (OS X Snow Leopard will actually be able to use GPUs to take the load off the CPU for some tasks) while the 9400M can be used for better battery life. Unfortunately you have to log out to switch between GPUs, which is not the case with using Hybrid SLI in Windows.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_energy_saver.jpg" alt="Energy Saver Graphics Settings"/></div>
<p>Unlike what The Apple Blog claims (below), I did not find the graphics performance to be even nearly that great.</p>
<blockquote><p>Game performance is as you would expect — nothing short of exceptional. The popular games I tested were able to run with settings at their most detailed, at full resolution, with no noticeable problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps if you have only owned Apple laptops all your life, the graphics in the latest MacBook Pro would seem amazing, but in the grand scheme of things they are still mediocre. For example, while playing Call of Duty 4 I was able to play at 1440&#215;900 but with no AF, no AA and the other settings set to medium. Even then that configuration got around 30FPS most of the time and a choppy ~15FPS when there was lots of action going on. You can definitely get a gaming session in, but you won&#8217;t be gawking at the best graphics, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>However, I was able to play Spore, a not so graphically-intense game, at full 1440&#215;900 resolution with settings maxed - although I lowered some settings a bit to make it more &#8220;comfortable&#8221; to play. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review" title="MacBook and MacBook Pro Dual Review">Gizmodo has a few test videos of Spore playing</a> with all settings maxed.</p>
<p>I suppose the thing to take away from this is that yes, you can actually &#8220;game&#8221; on the MacBook Pro now.. to a degree. </p>
<h4>Trackpad</h4>
<p>The new trackpad is itself a button. If you use it as you would the previous trackpad, with your thumb doing the clicking at the bottom portion of the trackpad, you won&#8217;t have much of an issue using it. After using the trackpad for a week I had no problems with it. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_trackpad_1200.jpg" title="New MacBook Pro Trackpad"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_trackpad_1200.jpg" alt="New MacBook Pro Trackpad"/></a><br/><small>The new trackpad - more space, less buttons.</small></div>
<p>Enabling tap to click helped a lot during my transition period of getting used to the new trackpad, as it was fairly awkward having to push down the entire surface for every single click. The trackpad supports one finger right click as well, for either the bottom left or bottom right.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_trackpad_options_670.jpg" title=""><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_trackpad_options_670.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>As for new finger gestures, there is four finger left/right swipe for switching applications and then up/down for Expose. I have tried adopting the four finger gestures into my workflow but using active screen corners for things like Expose seems easier to me.</p>
<h4>The Glare</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ve read about it everywhere; the new MacBook Pro is pretty darn glossy and reflective. Even more so than the old MBP which simply had a glossy filter on top of the display. This time it is actually the iPhone-like glass display and bezel cover that is doing the reflecting.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_macbookpro_glossy_1200.jpg" title="MacBook Pro Screen Glare"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_macbookpro_glossy.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro Screen Glare"></a><br/><small>In the glare:  me wearing a St. Patrick&#8217;s day edition Georgia Tech t-shirt</small></div>
<p>How does it actually fare in the real world? In the typical class room, with overhead fluorescent lighting, the new MacBook Pro is fairly hard to use. I want to save battery power and keep the backlight low but with a ridiculous amount of glare I don&#8217;t really have much of a choice but to max the backlight brightness. Even then there are times when I still can&#8217;t see parts of the screen.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_night_1200.jpg" title="MacBook Pro in the dark"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_night.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro in the dark"/></a></div>
<p>On the other hand, I often work in a batcave at home so I am not bothered by any glare whatsoever. That and to be honest, my MacBook Pro is <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/01/29/first-impressions-dell-24-inch-lcd-display" title="First Impressions: Dell 24-inch LCD Display">connected to my 24-inch external display</a> about 75 percent of the time.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_couch_noglare_1200.jpg" title="New MacBook Pro"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/new_mbp_couch_noglare.jpg" alt="New MacBook Pro"/></a><br/></div>
<p>Pictured above: The MacBook Pro as I&#8217;m using it right now - no glare to be seen, as the light is in front of me. It really just depends on how your workspace lighting is setup, and <strong>if you can&#8217;t control that, then you will have a big issue with the glare</strong>. Aside from the glare, the display definitely stands out in the crowd and is slick, very bright yet still dishes out vivid albeit not necessarily accurate colors.</p>
<h4>Battery Life</h4>
<p>My first battery test was with the graphics set to use the 9600M GT and backlight brightness set to 50 percent. I did basic Wi-Fi-enabled productivity tasks like taking notes in Google Docs and browsing the web. That test yielded 2 hours and 12 minutes. </p>
<p>With the more energy efficient 9400M GPU enabled I was able to get 4 hours and 24 minutes of battery life. That number touched just barely 5 hours after I had installed the Intel SSD. Anything over 4 hours of battery life is remarkable to me so I&#8217;m very happy with this for such as large laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> My definition of a battery life test is until OS X provides me with the reserve power warning, not until the MBP goes to sleep by itself.</p>
<h4>Keyboard Issue</h4>
<p>While I was unable to capture this in a picture, I have started noticing that the keys leave a mark on the screen - like the infamous problem the old Titanium PowerBooks had. While the keyboard is in fact recessed into the unibody frame, I can see that the keys stick out above the recess ever so slightly. I will have to wait a bit longer before applying further judgment. It might just be my MBP, or it might be how I stick the laptop in my messenger bag everyday along with another notebook.</p>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>Leave it to Apple to create a solid, high-performing product with one blatant Achilles&#8217; heel, the glossy display. Aside from several nitpicks mentioned within this article and the ridiculously glossy display, I have no problems with this notebook whatsoever. It has excellent battery life with the ability to play games as well, easy access to the hard drive, 4GB of DDR3 RAM as standard (with the ability to support 6GB now, and with Snow Leopard hopefully 8GB), a comfortable keyboard, spacious trackpad and amazingly sturdy construction.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Can you live with a very glossy display? I can, but I&#8217;m not exactly smitten about it.</p>
<p>Any questions? Do you have a new MacBook/MacBook Pro? How do you like it?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After slapping an Intel X25-M solid state drive in my MacBook Pro I received a few inquiries from readers asking if it was safe to use PGP Whole Disk Encryption with SSDs being known for having limited lifespans. I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/09/06/review-pgp-whole-disk-encryption-for-mac-os-x">reviewed PGP WDE for OS X</a> two months ago and fell in love with it; utter simplicity, <a href="http://www.pgp.com/insight/newsroom/press_releases/wde_undergoes_common_criteria_evaluation_process.html" title="WDE Undergoes Common Criteria Evaluation Process">trusted security</a> and it doesn&#8217;t affect system performance. However, a common misconception is that there is a lot of encryption happening in the background  that puts undue stress on the hard drive, and as such, would be risky to employ on a solid state drive.</p>
<p>I contacted PGP about this concern and here&#8217;s what Jon Callas (Cofounder, CTO, and CSO of the PGP Corporation) had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The short answer is that it doesn&#8217;t have an effect on life. Encrypting the disk is going to do a sweep across the disk reading and writing all the blocks. The disk is rated for many reads and writes. This is just one. After the disk is encrypted, it works just like it did, except that the data is encrypted before it is written. For any block B of data, the write is of E(B). That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>The longer answer is that while the short answer is true, there are some more issues that no one can give you a definitive answer on, because there is none.</p>
<p>All flash systems have wear leveling in them. Wear leveling operates below the main drive and makes sure that repeated writes to a &#8220;physical&#8221; block are actually spread out across the flash.</p>
<p>Wear leveling systems are not only proprietary, but constantly changing. The same core flash system from different providers will have different wear leveling systems, and a single manufacturer is constantly updating their own wear-leveling systems. (A similar thing goes on in rotating media, where different revisions of firmware on a spindle might have a completely different encoding system.)</p>
<p>We could also debate about whether or not the wear leveling would leave plaintext in some nook or cranny. My answer is probably not &#8212; since the WDE process is doing a sweep across the drive, it has to hit every sector. But of course, there are extra sectors for bad block replacement as well. We quickly get into the area where there&#8217;s no possible definitive statement.</p>
<p>However, if one is really paranoid, it should be obvious that it is better to encrypt the disk *before* you put sensitive data on it, because that will always be protected. So, for example, if you got a brand new MacBook Air, encrypt the thing before you migrate.</p>
<p>I attended a talk this year on flash systems, and learned a lot about the internals of flash disks, but that was months ago. The bottom line is that because the encrypt is one sweep across the disk, it&#8217;s minimal in effect.</p>
<p>Let me add one more thing that you likely didn&#8217;t know: once you start running WDE, you will actually *improve* the life of your SSD boot drive. The reason for this is &#8220;safesleep.&#8221; Safesleep is what the modern Macs use for sleeping.</p>
<p>There are really two types of sleeping, &#8220;suspending&#8221; and &#8220;hibernating.&#8221; In suspend, the machine is running and powered, but in a low-activity state. In hibernate, the contents of memory is written out to disk and then the running system is restored from there.</p>
<p>Safesleep does both. It both writes all of memory out to disk (in /var/vm/sleepimage), and then suspends the system. If you pop the battery (for example), it will restart from the sleepimage.</p>
<p>When you set up WDE, we disable the hibernation. There are a number of reasons for that. One is that actually, based on the way we do the EFI Boot, Apple disables the hibernation, not us. But if they didn&#8217;t, we would. Hibernate images are dangerous things because they contain all of memory, including crypto keys. (I find it amusing to worry about coldboot attacks, myself. Hibernation is much more dangerous. I leave the effect of sleepimage on the FileVault as an exercise for you to think about.) We do not yet have a good way to safely do hibernation. What I mean by safe includes both making sure the system boots correctly and without errors, and making sure that the sleepimage is properly encrypted. We hope to have a solution soon, we just don&#8217;t have one now.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you&#8217;re using an SSD, it&#8217;s writing all of memory out every time you close the lid on your laptop. With WDE, you are not. Therefore there&#8217;s less wear on your disk. (By the way, there are other ways to disable hibernation &#8212; I once saw a control panel to do it. I don&#8217;t meant to imply that this is the only way, just that if you install WDE and do nothing else, you will lower the wear on your SSD.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Jon touched on how OS X systems with PGP WDE do not use hibernation anymore, something I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/12/06/how-to-quickly-sleep-your-macbook">wrote about last December as a way of quickly sleeping your MacBook</a>. If you&#8217;re not in using that already, I highly suggest it:</p>
<p><code>sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0</code></p>
<p>I just installed PGP Whole Disk Encryption on my X25-M and imported my previously created encryption keyring files. The encryption process took a bit longer than an hour, compared to the 2-3 hours it took on my MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply Jon!</p>
<p><strong>Have you begun encrypting personal files since my WDE review?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has almost been a year since <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/14/the-future-of-computing-ssd" title="The Future of Computing: SSD">I wrote about the future of computing</a> and how I thought that it was all about Solid State Drives (this was before I became infatuated with <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/21/how-to-live-the-cloud-life" title="How To: Live the Cloud Life">the cloud</a>). Well I finally got my hands on one. It&#8217;s Intel&#8217;s new X25-M 80GB SSD and it is among the fastest consumer-aimed SSDs out right now. At a retail of $600 on the low end and $700 on the higher end, depending on where you grab it from, the X25-M is definitely not cheap. Worth it? </p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Thanks to avid PSTAM reader <a href="http://www.pestaola.gr/" title="Pestaola.gr">Titanas from Pestaola.gr</a> who helped pay for part of this SSD. </p>
<h4>Specs, Unboxing &#038; MacBook Pro Installation</h4>
<p>Why is this SSD better than the rest? Simply put, Intel has engineered a remarkable controller for the NAND flash memory chips (20&#215;4GB) in the X25-M. The name is derived from the 2.5-inch form factor of the drive and that it is based on Multi-Level Cell NAND chips. The results are staggering: a <strong>250MB/s sustained read rate</strong> and <strong>70MB/s sustained write rate</strong>. And this is the &#8217;slow&#8217; version of the drive. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/intel_x25m_ssd_unboxing_1200.jpg" title="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD)"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/intel_x25m_ssd_unboxing.jpg" alt="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD)"/></a></div>
<p>Intel also has the X25-E enterprise edition (only 32 and 64GB) of the drive in development, which uses SLC NAND chips. When it comes to SSDs, MLC and SLC are two terms you will hear quite often. NAND chips using MLC hold double the storage (2 bits per cell) in the same amount of space as chips using SLC but the catch is that it takes longer to write and read data with MLC. SLC chips only store 1 bit per cell but benefit from increased lifespan.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/intel_x25m_ssd_closeup_1200.jpg" title="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD)"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/intel_x25m_ssd_closeup.jpg" alt="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD)"/></a></div>
<p>Back to Intel&#8217;s remarkable storage controller - it supports SMART monitoring and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Command_Queuing">Native Command Queuing</a>. NCQ was first introduced in SATA disk drives to prioritize disk read/write operations based on the current location of the head, and therefore eliminate superfluous revolutions and head movement. In terms of SSDs, NCQ is used to queue requests. The X25-M can queue up to 32 requests while it&#8217;s already working on another operation.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_ssd_install_remove_retainer_1200.jpg" title="Removing the stock hard drive from an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_ssd_install_remove_retainer.jpg" alt="Removing the stock hard drive from an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"/></a><br/><small>Removing the stock hard drive, starting with the retainer.</small></div>
<p>As for the lifetime of this drive, <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/mainstream/index.htm">Intel states a MTBF of 1.2 million hours</a> - around the same as with enterprise-class mechanical hard disk drives.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_install_intel_x25m_ssd_1200.jpg" title="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD) being installed in an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_install_intel_x25m_ssd.jpg" alt="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD) being installed in an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"/></a><br/><small>Intel X25-M Solid State Drive installed in MacBook Pro.</small></div>
<p>Installation in the new MacBook Pro was a breeze. I just open the drive compartment, unscrew the drive retainer and disconnect the SATA/power cable from the old drive. Then I just had to transfer over the torx screws that hold the drive in the case to the SSD, connect the cable, place the drive in the MBP and put back the retainer and bay cover. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_intel_x25m_ssd_install_1200.jpg" title="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD) Installed in an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mbp_intel_x25m_ssd_install.jpg" alt="Intel X25-M 80GB Solid State Drive (SSD) Installed in an Apple MacBook Pro (Late 2008)"/></a><br/><small>Intel X25-M Solid State Drive installed in MacBook Pro.</small></div>
<p>Prior to that I had cloned the hard drive with SuperDuper onto an external drive. I installed Leopard and then told migration assistant to transfer data over from the external drive. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<h4>By the Numbers</h4>
<p>What does it really feel like to use an Intel SSD? For one, OS X <strong>Leopard boots up in about 26 seconds</strong> and <strong>shuts down in 3 seconds</strong>. Photoshop CS3 takes about ~5 seconds to open and load a 12 megapixel image.

<p>I also ran Xbench on this machine and <a href="http://db.xbench.com/merge.xhtml?doc1=316395">it scored a 209.98</a>. For comparison, the average score for a Mac Pro is 156 and the average score for a MacBook Pro is 109.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/xbench_x25m_ssd_pstam_mbp.jpg" alt="Xbench disk score for Intel X25-M SSD"/></div>
<p>Despite the perceived great performance, the X25-M still uses MLC for its NAND chips and that inherently leads to okay but not great write speeds. However, that is if you compare it to SLC SSDs or 3.5-inch form factor 7200rpm and faster mechanical drives. When compared to typical notebook drives, the X25-M still blows most of the competition out of the water. That being said, my first day of using the X25-M was filled with huge grins - previously only produced by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls/244858807/" title="Ford GT at Road Atlanta">rides in supercars</a>. </p>
<h4>FAQ</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So SSDs don&#8217;t use much power.. does that mean you get like an extra hour of battery life?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The X25-M uses around 0.06 Watts at idle and 0.15 Watts under load, compared to a typical 5400rpm 2.5-inch hard drive&#8217;s power consumption of around 0.85 Watts at idle and 2.50 Watts under load (using the WD 320GB Scorpio Blue as reference). However, I have yet to be able to put a number on this in battery life tests. At the moment I would say it adds another 20-25 minutes to battery life, but more tests are pending. <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10078111-64.html" title="Intel: solid-state drives boost battery life">Intel confirmed this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> $600+, isn&#8217;t that better spent on RAM?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Short answer: yes. Long answer: but after you have a good amount of RAM.. consider an SSD. Granted, you would only need a fraction of that money to max out your computer with RAM, an SSD such as the X25-M is still a solid choice. The point of using RAM is so that the computer doesn&#8217;t have to store data in-use on the slow hard drive. The second you run out of physical RAM and your computer starts writing to disk, it&#8217;s almost like hitting a brick wall. By replacing that bottleneck with a faster SSD, you won&#8217;t have as much of an issue. However, the best defense is to have enough RAM so you don&#8217;t need to resort to writing to disk.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How can you possibly live with a mere 80GB drive on your primary computer?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Coming from using a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/20/review-macbook-air" title="Review: MacBook Air">1.6GHz MacBook Air</a> with an 80GB hard drive for 8 months, I realized I don&#8217;t really need too much space. At the moment I have my MacBook Pro configured exactly the way I like it, with all the apps I use, my music library and even 2 games and I still have 22GB left. My Ubuntu HTPC does the heavy lifting with 2&#215;750GB drives and a 74GB 10kRPM drive. I have it serve up the drives as Samba shares, which I access over the network. Personal documents and non-media files are are stored on Amazon S3 and not locally.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where did you get the X25-M from?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Amazon.com</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have some cash lying around, ever since I played it safe and put my money in a CD and not the stock market. Should I get the X25-M now? I have no problem waiting 6 months.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Wait. It took a year for SSDs to go from pretty slow and cost $2000 for 64GB to very fast and ~$600 for 80GB. In early 2009 Intel will have the next versions of the X25-M available and while still based on slower MLC NAND, will utilize a 34nm fabrication process as opposed to the current 50nm process. They will come in flavors exceeding 160GB.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I do a lot of stuff on my MacBook Pro: gaming, video producing, file extraction, you name it, I do it all the time. Will this SSD last the life of my laptop?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes. Intel rates the X25-M at 5 years assuming you work through 100GB of data per day. Chances are you don&#8217;t even come close to that every single day. The storage controller also does some advanced wear leveling to ensure that unresponsive cells aren&#8217;t used further, so even if you do near the end of the MTBF, your data won&#8217;t just disappear immediately or start acting slow.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If this SSD is just 20 some odd chips, how much weight do you save compared to a mechanical hard drive?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Negligible. Intel still wraps the X25-M in a protective aluminum casing, so it&#8217;s not just the weight of the PCB and chips anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is this sucker going to burn my lap?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> I opened the drive compartment and touched the SSD while it was running under normal use (non-gaming) and it was ~90 degrees F. In other words, it is one of the cooler components in my MacBook Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Would you do it again?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes! While I am by and far a thoroughbred early adopter, I was and still am floored with the performance delivered by the X25-M. </p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? Would you drop $600+ on an X25-M?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/06/how-i-got-a-macbook-air-for-15-dollars" title="How I Got a MacBook Air for 15 Dollars">purchased my MacBook Air 8 months ago</a>, it has been my primary machine. I did everything on it, with the exception of HD movie viewing which was <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/21/going-hd-part-2-htpc" title="Going HD: Part 2 - HTPC">outsourced to my HTPC setup</a>. It was a bit on the slow end but <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/20/review-macbook-air" title="Review: MacBook Air">I enjoyed the portability</a>. However in the recent months my feelings towards it have changed substantially. </p>
<p>At first <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/25/macbook-air-susceptible-to-gravity" title="MacBook Air Susceptible to Gravity">it fell 2 feet</a> and I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/11/review-techrestore-mac-repair" title="Review: TechRestore Mac Repair">had to get the screen replaced</a>. The repair wasn&#8217;t perfect and left the bezel bent up a bit. A month or two later the microDVI port died, all the while the battery life had gone from 4 hours when new all the way down to a paltry 2 hours. Not to mention the whole <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/05/11/putting-an-end-to-macbook-air-core-shutdown" title="Putting an End to MacBook Air Core Shutdown">core shutdown issue which required a little hack</a> to get working properly, even with a software update Apple released a while back. I decided it was time for me to ditch the Air and get something more reliable and powerful. Portability won&#8217;t be as big an issue for me in the future as I graduate in 47 days and won&#8217;t need to take my laptop to classes anymore.</p>
<p>Enter the 2.53GHz MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro gains the MacBook Air&#8217;s styling and keyboard, of which I am a big fan. Naturally, this notebook is blindingly fast compared to the Air. Most notably, Firefox is fast and there is no hesitation creating new tabs or scrolling. I&#8217;ll leave the performance talk for a review after I get a chance to play with this more. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/new_macbookpro_1200.jpg" title="New Apple MacBook Pro Unboxing"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/new_macbookpro.jpg" alt="New Apple MacBook Pro Unboxing"></a></div>
<p>The stock 2.53GHz MacBook Pro comes with a mediocre 5400RPM 320GB hard drive. After a bit of help from <a href="http://www.pestaola.gr/about-titanas/">Titanas</a>, I ordered Intel&#8217;s new <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/14/the-future-of-computing-ssd" title="The Future of Computing: SSD">SSD</a> for this laptop. It&#8217;s the 80GB X25-M and runs for about $600-700 USD if you can find it. It&#8217;s pretty much the fastest SSD out right now. Read <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/10/so-i-got-one-of-new-intel-ssds.html" title="So I got one of new intel ssds">Linus Torvalds&#8217; thoughts on it</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/new_macbookpro_booting_1200.jpg" title="New Apple MacBook Pro Booting - 2.53GHz"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/new_macbookpro_booting.jpg" alt="New Apple MacBook Pro Booting - 2.53GHz"></a></div>
<p>I&#8217;ll post my thoughts on this notebook later on, but I love it so far. Briefly: (1) Yes, the glare is ridiculous, (2) after a few hours of using the trackpad and enabling tap to click, the trackpad is a joy to use, (3) the construction on this thing is solid and feels very sturdy.</p>
<p>The best part about the new MacBook Pro? The graphics. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/callofduty4_9400_1440.jpg" alt="Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare on MacBook Pro with Nvidia GeForce 9400M"/><br/><small>Call of Duty 4: MBP using GeForce 9400M (not the more powerful 9600) at 1440&#215;990 with no AA and moderate AF. It&#8217;s pushing a slightly sluggish 18FPS. The 9400M is enabled by default, I have yet to test it with the 9600 GPU enabled.</small></div>
<p>I can actually play games. I&#8217;ve installed Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and Spore is probably next. Granted textures,  antriscopic filtering and anti-aliasing settings aren&#8217;t going to be maxed out at 1440&#215;990 but you can still get a good session in with moderate settings. </p>
<h4>Config</h4>
<p>For those curious, here are the first things I installed on my MBP:</p>
<ul>
<li>XCode 3.1.1</li>
<li>Firefox 3 with add-ons: ColorZilla, Firebug, Delicious Bookmarks, Feedly, Hellafox (<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/12/how-to-download-with-newsgroups">to control hellanzb</a> on HTPC), Inquisitor, Quartz PDF Plugin, Searchbar Autosizer</li>
<li>MacPorts and MySQL5, Git, Rubygems</li>
<li>Photoshop CS3</li>
<li>Fluid.app - GMail, TheSixtyOne.com, HypeM.com, Campfire</li>
<li>AppZapper</li>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/16/how-to-quickie-swipe-in-firefox">MultiClutch</a> to get some trackpad gestures working in Firefox 3 (although there is an experimental version of FF3 in the works to support these gestures)</li>
<li>Perian, Flip4Mac</li>
<li>VLC Player</li>
<li>Unison, MacPAR deLuxe</li>
<li>Transmit, TextMate</li>
<li>MenuMeters</li>
<li>Adium</li>
<li>TweetDeck</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s what Valleywag author Paul Boutin wants me to do in his latest Wired magazine article aptly-titled <a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/magazine/16-11/st_essay" title="Twitter, Flickr, Facebook Make Blogs Look So 2004" rel="nofollow">Kill Your Blog</a>. Don&#8217;t worry, I am definitely not going to heed Mr Boutin&#8217;s so-called advice and <strong>I&#8217;m not shutting down my blog</strong> (although I bet this post title just got me a ton of clicks). Neither should you. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/killyourblog_wired_1200.jpg" title="Wired Magazine article: Kill Your Blog"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/killyourblog_wired.jpg" alt="Wired Magazine article: Kill Your Blog"/></a></div>
<p>Boutin, the hypocritical author of a New York Times article published in March <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/technology/personaltech/20basics.html">aimed at showing you how to blog</a>, now asserts that you should quit your blog right now. </p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s almost impossible to get noticed, except by hecklers. And why bother? The time it takes to craft sharp, witty blog prose is better spent expressing yourself on Flickr, Facebook, or Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>No. Flickr is great for posting a photo of the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls/2950093597/">$500,000 Mercedes McLaren SLR</a> I spotted over the weekend, but I can&#8217;t tell you <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/10/06/how-i-learned-to-code" title="How I Learned to Code">how I learned to code</a> with Flickr. The same type of thing goes for Facebook and Twitter. Each service has its own purpose and use. Understand that.</p>
<p>Boutin states that it&#8217;s hard for bloggers to get recognized. Louis Gray and Chris Brogan agree that running a popular blog <a href="http://www.louisgray.com/live/2008/10/making-your-blogging-much-more-than.html">is about how often you promote others</a> on your blog, therefore making it easier for people to find and read other great blogs. Every few days I discover blogs through conventional social bookmarking news sites like <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> as well as through recommendations of friends via services like <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/23/review-feedly-for-firefox" title="Review: Feedly for Firefox">Feedly</a>. Generally the great blogs I find are small but have very detailed, niche content - stuff that would have no place on a Facebook Note. </p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;The odds of your clever [blog post] entry appearing high on the [search engine results] list? Basically zero.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically zero? Not so fast Boutin. It all depends on the content. Niche is king here. Of all the things I&#8217;ve ever written on my blog, a post I didn&#8217;t really care about when I wrote still brings in new visitors. If you Google for &#8220;you need permission to perform this action&#8221; you&#8217;ll find my post about <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/02/09/how-to-quickie-vista-permissions">fixing a Windows Vista quirk</a>. It&#8217;s those types of blog posts that I am so grateful of blogs. Now what if everyone took Mr Boutin&#8217;s advice and stopped blogging. Google would sure as hell be useless for searching for code errors and tech support. In my experience the best answers are found on blogs. </p>
<p>The &#8220;authentic voices of amateur wordsmiths&#8221; are still there and most definitely get noticed. Take this blog as an example. </p>
<p>The rest of the article has no real substance as adequately supported <a href="http://pulse2.com/2008/10/21/paul-boutin-has-no-substance-to-his-blog-argument-shame-on-wired/">by this blogger&#8217;s reaction to the piece</a>. Boutin brings up the case of Jason Calacanis who stopped blogging in favor of his private mailing list. Boutin failed to bring up how Calacanis himself or other bloggers republish just about every email in that list to blogs.. kind of defeats the purpose, no?</p>
<p>I could have gone into much more detail slamming the Wired article but it&#8217;s quite obvious that <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/081021/p10#a081021p10" rel="nofollow">it&#8217;s just linkbait</a>. As usual, some wise commentary can be found on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=339127" title="Kill Your Blog">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Writing a blog helps you organize your thoughts, improves your writing skills, and teaches you to make good arguments (and recognize bad ones).</p>
<p>None of that requires having an audience. At least an audience larger than your friends and coworkers.</p>
<p>If you like to write, don&#8217;t stop writing because it&#8217;s not &#8220;where the buzz is at&#8221;. There&#8217;s more to life than following trends.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As for why I have been posting sporadically lately, three of my professors have somehow found a way to set identical due dates for sizable projects.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter which part of the Intarwebs you reside, you have probably heard something about today&#8217;s Apple event - the invitation to which was titled &#8220;the spotlight turns to notebooks.&#8221; The typical Apple blog rumor mills and <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums/topic/its-officcial-new-apple-laptops-on-october-14th-thoughts" title="It's Official New Apple Laptops on October 14th. Thoughts?">even the PSTAM forums</a> have been a flurry of activity in the past few days. Some claim we&#8217;ll see <a href="http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/natelanxon/0,139102300,49299275,00.htm">networked HDTVs with Apple TV</a>-like functionality  incorporated, while others say the we&#8217;ll be seeing a new MacBook starting at $899 (other rumors say that price is for a 24-inch LED-backlit LCD display).</p>
<p>Regardless of the rumors, one thing is for sure, this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/13/mr-blurrycam-reveals-the-updated-macbook-pro-899-laptop-model/" title="The Updated MacBook Pro">leaked image of new MacBook Pro</a> is pretty slick. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/contains_spoilers">John Gruber seems to have the best pre-event post</a> detailing what&#8217;s to come today.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/macbookpro_leak.jpg" alt="Updated MacBook Pro"/><br/><small>Image Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/13/mr-blurrycam-reveals-the-updated-macbook-pro-899-laptop-model/" title="The Updated MacBook Pro">Engadget</a></small></div>
<p>But that&#8217;s enough of rumors and the like, the Apple event is less than an 1 hour away (1pm Eastern). Here&#8217;s where you can follow along:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While it may sound like some paltry attempt to evangelize another form of Wi-Fi connectivity, WiMax is a  substantially different technology that&#8217;s aiming high. Why is this something to familiarize yourself with? Last week WiMAX was &#8220;turned on&#8221; for the city of Baltimore, Maryland - and many more cities are on the way. In a nutshell, WiMAX refers to a set of technical specifications detailing   a network based on the IEEE 802.16 protocol.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with 802.11 (what you currently know as Wi-Fi), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.16" title="IEEE 802.16">802.16</a> is a standard for point to multipoint broadband wireless connectivity. The current revision, 802.16e-2005, has provisions for mobile broadband access, dubbed Mobile WiMAX, such as while in a car at highway speeds. Aside from those details, <strong>Mobile WiMAX is a type of 4G network</strong>, although this is currently classified as Pre-4G since there is no formal definition of 4G. On an unrelated note, I am looking forward to 4G&#8217;s inherent IPv6 support. This could usher in another strong push for IPv6 support across all Internet-connected devices and hopefully quench the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums/topic/china-running-out-of-ip-addresses" title="China Running Out of IP Addresses">forthcoming IPv4 address exhaustion</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wimax-diagram.gif" alt="How WiMAX Works"/><br/><small>A basic diagram showing how Fixed WiMAX works.. but the real benefits come with Mobile WiMAX as well as <a href="http://www.wimax.com/commentary/blog/blog-2007/deploying-and-managing-femtocells-in-todays-mobile-networks" title="Deploying and Managing Femtocells in Today's Mobile Networks">femtocells</a>.</small></div>
<p>WiMAX suffers from the archaic issue that most wireless technologies subscribe by - the further away you are from the origin, the more bit errors you&#8217;ll encounter and thus the slower your access will be to maintain acceptable service. Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.wimax.com/education/faq/faq26/?searchterm=qos" title="Does WiMAX have quality of service (QOS) capability?">quality-of-service implementation in WiMAX</a> will ensure more efficient data transmission. Also, you&#8217;re competing for the same connection with other users in your geographical area. Adding more WiMAX towers to the network will allay these issues but that will take time.</p>
<p>In practical terms current WiMAX rollouts, such as Sprint&#8217;s XOHM service, <strong>brings users download speeds of 2-4 Mbps</strong>. My first reaction - so what? That&#8217;s not terribly fast. Hopefully these speeds will ramp up slowly in the next 5 years. The theoretical limitation of WiMAX is around 70 Mbps albeit at very short ranges, so it is more feasible that the end user will see something around 10Mbps with a mature implementation. The release of WiMAX based on 802.16m will boost that number up to 1 Gbps for fixed usage and 100 Mbps for mobile applications, probably not coming to you in 2010-11. Also, WiMAX&#8217;s line-of-sight limitation is 30 miles and a weak 1-5 miles for not line-of-sight environments. For sufficient coverage of an entire city, it will take a <em>ton</em> of WiMAX towers and subsequently even more backhaul towers to relay the signals from the line-of-sight towers transmitters to the end-user. That doesn&#8217;t sound easy.</p>
<p>Aside from the technology behind WiMAX, how will this be different than 3G connectivity that many of us use with our laptops? <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=10401&#038;tag=nl.e019" title="Beyond mobile broadband, WiMAX is about blowing up the wireless business model">Jason Hiner at ZDNet suggests</a> that the affordable embeddable broadband aspect of WiMAX will be something to keep an eye on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Embedded WiMAX chips for laptops, for example, are already cheaper than their embedded 3G counterparts. For example, a WiMAX module will typically add about $60-$80 to the price of a laptop, while embedded 3G will add $150-$200.</p>
<p>But beyond that, these cheap WiMAX chips are poised to be embedded in all kinds of devices, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Parking meters</li>
<li>Home energy meters</li>
<li>Vending machines</li>
<li>Toys</li>
<li>Traffic lights</li>
<li>Cars and other motor vehicles</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this will be huge, assuming other WiMAX providers structure their pricing plans after Sprint&#8217;s XOHM, which boasts contract-free options like a $10 day pass and $35 for on-the-go monthly access. Compare this to AT&#038;T&#8217;s 3G LaptopConnect cards which require a $60 per month data plan that only accomodates a mere 5GB of included data transfer. </p>
<h4>WiMAX: Zero or Hero?</h4>
<p>WiMAX has been exorbitantly hyped since the 2001 inception of the WiMAX Forum. It&#8217;s 2008 and most people think WiMAX is like municipal Wi-Fi on steriods. Beyond consumer confusion, basic WiMAX coverage is at least 2-3 years away for those living in major U.S. cities. Only Sprint and Clearwire are currently backing WiMAX expansion while others are working towards the next hot thing: <strong>L</strong>ong <strong>T</strong>erm <strong>E</strong>volution, which from what I can tell, is superior to WiMAX is every way (peak download rates of 326 Mbps) other than not being here yet.</p>
<p><strong>You will keep hearing about WiMAX</strong>, especially with Intel&#8217;s Centrino 2 chipset supporting WiMAX as part of its core functionality. However, I think <strong>WiMAX will struggle</strong> to make a big dent in technology and will go the way of the <del datetime="2008-10-14T00:26:45+00:00">dodo</del> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAM" title="RDRAM">RAMbus RDRAM</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this quote from a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/04/08/things-are-certainly-happening-quickly-in-the-wireless-industry-the-iphone-has-actually-lived-up-to-much-of-the-absurd-hype-that-preceded-its-release/" title="CTIA Roundup –- Game Over for WiMax?">Venture Beat article summarizing the CTIA 2008 wireless conference</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One CEO of a WiMax operator in Australia said the technology “failed miserably” with latencies (delays) as high as 1000 ms only 400m away from a cell site, and “non-existent” non-line-of-sight reception beyond a mile away. They had to switch back to TD-CDMA just to ensure their customers got a dial tone.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you think about mobile broadband initiatives like WiMAX? Do you have a need for mobile broadband or are you fine with your Wi-Fi AP at home, at the university/work and at the occasional coffee shop?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/09/19/apple-recalls-iphone-3g-ultracompact-usb-power-adapter/" title="Apple Recalls iPhone 3G Ultracompact USB Power Adapter">I learned about the Apple recall</a> of their (&#8221;impossibly small&#8221; as Steve Jobs would say) iPhone 3G USB power adapter. Apparently the prongs are at risk of separating from the adapter and becoming lodged in electrical outlets. I filled out the form online and today the replacement adapter arrived.  </p>
<p>However, this post isn&#8217;t about the actual recall. It&#8217;s about how <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/10/10/apple-appears-green-may-be-more-greenish-brown/" title="Apple Appears Green, May Be More Greenish-Brown">Apple doesn&#8217;t know how to be green</a>, not to mention save money. I found Apple&#8217;s boxing <strong>extremely superfluous</strong> and they shipped it FedEx 2 day. Kind of a waste if you ask me. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/apple_power_adapter_recall_1200.jpg" title="Apple's replacement for their recalled power adapter"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/apple_power_adapter_recall.jpg" alt="Apple's replacement for their recalled power adapter"/></a><br/><small>Come on Apple, you could have sent this in an envelope!</small></div>

Background: the recalled adapter.</small></div>
<p>As for what the letter reads, it asks people to send back the recalled power adapter within 10 business days or risk being charged a non-return fee in the amount described &#8220;at the time of order confirmation.&#8221; </p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p><strong>Have you applied for a replacement adapter?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you talk to accomplished programmers, it&#8217;s no shock to hear they began programming at a very young age. Unfortunately, I was not the same way and did not grow up programming. I was much more into hardware during my childhood. I learned how to solder, read and write circuit schematics and build small projects. For my 7th grade science fair project I built a so-called breadboard robot built around a <a href="http://www.parallax.com/tabid/214/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">BASIC Stamp</a> II microcontroller. However, you can only do so much hardware until you need to know something about software. It was then that I first got my hands on programming, years after I had tinkered with my dad&#8217;s IBM DOS box and then my sisters&#8217; 25MHz Macintosh Centris 650 in 1993. I had to. The robot wasn&#8217;t going to find its way out of a maze without any instructions. </p>
<p><em>Thanks to Anonymous for <a href="http://skribit.com/suggestions/how-did-i-first-learn-to-code" title="How Did I First Learn to Code - Skribit.com">suggesting this article via Skribit</a>, and to the readers that voted heavily on it over the last few days.</em></p>
<p>All I had for reference with a massive, verbose PBASIC programming book that came with the microcontroller. That didn&#8217;t work so well. Fortunately, I got to know one of the managers at a local electronics store and he introduced me to some of the Basic programming language foundations, from gosub to interfacing with the microcontroller&#8217;s I/O registers. I went to the state level for that science fair but my robot didn&#8217;t do much other than move sporadically. </p>
<h4>My CS History</h4>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the end of high school when I took a computer science course that I touched programming again. It was Java and <a href="http://twitter.com/jimmynewland" title="Jimmy Newland">the teacher</a> introduced us to the teaching-friendly <a href="http://www.bluej.org/" rel="nofollow" title="BlueJ Java IDE">BlueJ IDE</a>. That same year I had a period where I would hang out with that teacher in the library and go and fix computers (remove spyware) from various teachers&#8217; computers when summoned. </p>
<p>During that same time I had an idea to make a website allowing visitors to customize computers that I would build and ship. This was when I first got involved with HTML and used Dreamweaver - often on that same teacher&#8217;s Titanium PowerBook G4 when he was off running errands. The site never really launched but I implemented a photo uploader that somehow found its way all over the tubes and people began using my server for image hosting. I had to shut that down after it used several hundred gigabytes of bandwidth.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the summer after my freshman year at college. Along with a friend in my dormitory, I decided to create a wiki website compiling all sorts of computer modification information. For the years prior, I was very much into building, modifying and overclocking computers, had won numerous LAN party PC building competitions and had worked my first job building computers in an unairconditioned warehouse in Texas and installing them at schools for $7 an hour. (It was around the time that LGA775 first started being used by Intel so I was pretty psyched about playing with those machines.)</p>
<p>My friend and I created TheModWiki.org, began writing articles about computer modifications and spread the word. It was through tinkering with this project that I was exposed to PHP with <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, as well as Linux systems administration. It was also around this time that several friends in my dormitory got me hooked on Linux and I began using Gentoo Linux with Fluxbox exclusively for about a year. </p>
<p>That friend wanted to start a blog and began researching a few content management systems. I was equally curious and decided to install WordPress on my then-new Mac Mini G4. I liked WordPress and ended up buying PaulStamatiou.com and began hosting this blog from my dorm. Fast forward a year later and I was quite proficient at CSS and XHTML from endlessly modifying my WordPress theme. </p>
<p>Of course, my college major is heavily involved with computer science so I have been subjected to a range of courses like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CS1371 (MATLAB/Java)</li>
<li>CS1322 (Java)</li>
<li>CS2260 (C)</li>
<li>CS2340 (SmallTalk)</li>
<li>LCC2700 (misc esoteric languages)</li>
<li>LCC3710 (Actionscript)</li>
<li>LCC3705 (PHP/MySQL/JS/AJAX)</li>
<li>CS3750 (User Interface Design)</li>
<li>CS4660 (Educational Technology)</li>
<li>CS4803CJ (Computational Journalism with PHP &#038; MySQL for some projects)</li>
<li>CS4803doc (Design of Online Communities)</li>
</ul>
<p> Among those, I learned the most about programming in the Information Design course LCC3705. There were only about 8 students in the class and it was taught by a graduate student from CMU, as I&#8217;m assuming Georgia Tech could not find a professor familiar enough with PHP, MySQL and AJAX to teach the class. It was a great class and very laidback. We learned a bit of PHP, tried it out on our own and then left. That class had a longer project at the end of the semester that I got into quite readily. I built a &#8220;party finder&#8221; application of sorts that used a PHP library for Google Maps and allowed users to create, share parties and find parties near them. It would subsequently load machine-tagged images from the parties from Flickr using their API and publish microformats data for each party.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/partyfinder.jpg" alt="Party Finder" /><br/><small>The only images I could find of that project.</small></div>
<p>From what I learned there, I wrote a few guides:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/12/27/how-to-code-your-first-web-app-part-1" title="How To: Code Your First Web App, Part 1">How To: Code Your First Web App, Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/12/28/how-to-code-your-first-web-app-part-2" title="How To: Code Your First Web App, Part 2">How To: Code Your First Web App, Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/12/29/how-to-code-your-first-web-app-part-3" title="How To: Code Your First Web App, Part 3">How To: Code Your First Web App, Part 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t recommend those articles anymore as you&#8217;re probably better off building a web app with an MVC framework but it&#8217;s a decent beginner&#8217;s guide to tying together simple PHP and MySQL.</p>
<h4>More Recently</h4>
<p>So that was a bit about my computer science and tech background, but how do I learn about computer science topics now? For the past ~11 months I have been involved with Skribit, where we use Ruby on Rails. It&#8217;s my first experience coding collaboratively using version control (<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/07/how-to-subversion-basics" title="How To: Subversion Basics">SVN</a> in our case) and an MVC framework. I&#8217;m still very far from being proficient at Ruby on Rails development but I can usually hack something together over time.</p>
<p>I watch and learn, then write. I spend time tracing code and seeing what each line of code does. I use Firebug to debug things on the front-end and prod about for performance issues with <a href="http://www.fiveruns.com/products/tuneup" rel="nofollow">TuneUp</a>. I also bug <a href="http://blog.codeeg.com/" title="Calvin Yu">Calvin</a> with Ruby questions from time to time. And of course, I Google anything and everything. Errno 1041? Google. NoMethodError? Google.</p>
<h4>How I Suggest You Get Started Coding</h4>
<p>Becoming good at programming lots of practice and inevitably lots of failures. There&#8217;s no way around this, it just takes time. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be drab and boring. I can look back at most things I&#8217;ve done and say that the reason I started them was my own curiosity. I was curious about WordPress, so I started a blog. I was curious about how computers worked, so I built my own. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_killed_the_cat" rel="nofollow">Curiosity may have killed the cat</a> but it&#8217;s a way of life in the tech world.</p>
<p>First off, know your environment. Make things easy on yourself and <strong>just get a Mac</strong>/use Linux, or become a slave to Cygwin in Windows. </p>
<ul>
<li>Get to know the Unix filesystem.</li>
<li>Learn vim basics.</li>
<li>Find a text editor you feel comfortable with.</li>
<li>Tinker with FTP.</li>
<li>Learn how to use SSH.</li>
<li> Install LAMP and <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/05/14/how-to-start-blogging" title="How To: Start Blogging">setup your own blog</a></strong>, preferably on a web host. Doing so will introduce you to the basics of DNS, PHP, MySQL databases (try phpMyAdmin), firewalls, the Apache web server and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Find out what you&#8217;re interested in and something you want to build</strong>. Build it by learning along the way with trial and error and..</p>
<ul>
<li>Read programming blogs and <a href="http://appjet.com/learn-to-program/lessons/intro">App Jet&#8217;s Absolute Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Programming on the Web</a>.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://askmego.com/home" rel="nofollow" title="AskMeGo">AskMeGo</a> is a recently launched company that aims to engage website visitors with their live Q&#038;A toolbar. However, their plans go much further than the toolbar. AskMeGo enables publishers and their users to tap into a &#8220;distributed knowledge network.&#8221; Anyone can ask a question through the toolbar and get paired with an self-proclaimed expert in that topic for a live one to one chat, all within the toolbar.  If an expert can&#8217;t be found to answer the question, the question will be posted and others can answer.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/askmego_asking_question_500.jpg" alt="AskMeGo Toolbar"/></div>
<p>AskMeGo also ties into instant messaging services (as to be expected from a company founded by people from the Yahoo! Messenger team) to alert users when an expert they&#8217;re looking for goes online. Furthermore, questions and answers as well as chats are logged on their site, making it easy for people to browse through past questions. All of this is accessible from their homepage.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/askmego_home.jpg" alt="AskMeGo Homepage"/></div>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>That&#8217;s enough with the explanation. What do I actually think about AskMeGo after testing them for a while?</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/askmego_answer_questions.jpg" alt="Answer a question on the AskMeGo toolbar"/></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used a website toolbar add-on before so it was interesting to see how user interaction would change. First off, I was impressed that it was even being used by my users at all and much more that people were asking legitimate, substantive questions like&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s the best way to learn Objective-C? Just dive in or is there a decent tutorial?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What is the best guide to setting up a automated backup on a Mac with Amazon S3?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>So I cracked my computer screen on accident. I&#8217;m taking it in tomorrow to have it appraised, and the woman said it would cost anywhere from $400 to $900 dollars. Is there a cheaper way to go about ..</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>i&#8217;m looking for a few iphone apps that will be good to download for my 6 year old son. Any thoughts on more educational games?</p></blockquote>
<p>Due to AskMeGo&#8217;s &#8220;distributed knowledge network&#8221;, it&#8217;s not just the website publisher&#8217;s users that interact with the toolbar - it&#8217;s every publishers&#8217; users that align with the topics you have selected to cover on your site. I&#8217;m still up in the air about this. I really think it would be neat to just have my audience use the toolbar, as a per-site thing, to facilitate niche technical conversations amongst readers rather than having it being tied to every other tech publisher using it, which introduces a bit of &#8220;noise&#8221; with those people asking questions like &#8220;i broke my macbook charger, where can i get another.&#8221; However, for smaller publishers it makes sense to have the toolbar tie into the larger network.</p>
<p>Since putting the toolbar on my site recently (and also about a month ago when I was testing another version of AskMeGo), I have received a few emails about how the toolbar obstructs the website a bit and almost demands more attention than the website itself, a bad thing for publishers. While I think that may be a large part of why AskMeGo works well, I would like to see an alternate version that has a certain feedback button that on click or on hover expands to show the entire toolbar.</p>
<p>What do you think about this style of live Q&#038;A? </p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> AskMeGo asked me to beta test their service for them, and as a courtesy I wrote this post to help describe some of my thoughts on their service. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I made the upgrade from the Nikon D80 to the <a href="http://chsvimg.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/d90/en/index.html">new Nikon D90</a>. The D90&#8217;s claim to fame is that it is first DSLR camera to feature video recording. This lets me consolidate my gadgets as I just gave back my loaned <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/17/review-samsung-sc-hmx10c-hd-camcorder" title="Review: Samsung SC-HMX10C HD Camcorder">Samsung SC-HMX10C HD camcorder</a>. The D90 bundle comes with the new Nikon 18-105mm VR lens and retails for around $1,300 USD. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nikon_d90_press_photo.jpg" alt="Nikon D90"/></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nikon_d90_box_1024.jpg" title="Nikon D90 VR Kit Box"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nikon_d90_box.jpg" alt="Nikon D90 VR Kit Box"/></a></div>
<h4>Basics</h4>
<p>Some of the highlights of the Nikon D90 are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>12.3 megapixel CMOS with integrated dust reduction</li>
<li>3-inch rear LCD</li>
<li>Live View</li>
<li>D-Movie video recording up to 720p (HD)</li>
<li>Face Detection</li>
<li>18-105mm VR lens</li>
<li>Support for external GPS module</li>
<li>Active D-lighting</li>
<li>Great ISO range and low-noise shots</li>
<li>4.5 shots per second</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I jump right into the D90&#8217;s video recording, I must stress how much of a leap the D90 is from the D80 in terms of still photography features and performance. First off, it comes with a VR lens. Not many lower-end Nikon kits have come with this type of lens, which stands for vibration reduction. It makes for a great general purpose lens, but as <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/18-105mm.htm">Ken Rockwell points out</a> it&#8217;s &#8220;Nikon&#8217;s fuzziest lens in the corners at 18mm.&#8221; That being said, if this matters much to you, I&#8217;d just buy the D90 body and opt for arguably one of the best all-around lenses, the $660 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BY52NU/">Nikon 18-200mm VR lens</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nikon_d90_mirror_1024.jpg" title="Nikon D90 in the mirror"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nikon_d90_mirror.jpg" alt="Nikon D90 in the mirror"/></a></div>
<p>The first thing I liked about the D90 was the upgraded screen. It&#8217;s considerably larger and makes it easier to see if your shot was a success without digging in too deep. Next, <strong>I love Active D-Lighting</strong>. I only know a few things here and there about photography, so having it automatically adjust settings and &#8220;preserve details in highlights and shadows&#8221; and create photos with natural contrast is a big plus.</p>
<p>Then I noticed an Eye-Fi option in the menu. The D90 supports <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/26/review-eye-fi-explore-geotagging-sd-card" title="Review: Eye-Fi Explore Geotagging SD Card">the Eye-Fi wireless SD card</a> right out of the box, so you don&#8217;t have to dig through settings to get it to work properly, as you did in the past. However, I did notice one problem with using the Eye-Fi on the D90. It isn&#8217;t fast enough to save videos and holds up the camera for up to a minute when saving a recorded video.</p>
<p>The D90 totes features first introduced in cameras like the D300. For example, Live View is now offered on the D90. Live View brings back the familiar point-and-shoot style of shooting where <strong>you can use the LCD as a viewfinder</strong>. And with the D90&#8217;s spiffy 3-inch rear LCD, it&#8217;s fun to use. The main benefit of using Live View is being able to fine tune what your photo looks like by being able to zoom in digitally and then see how you should adjust your focus and other settings to achieve the look you&#8217;re going for. However, in Live View mode auto-focusing is very slow as the D90 tries to use face detection.</p>

<p>As I stated in <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/22/first-impressions-nikon-d300-dslr-camera">my Nikon D300 post</a>, most hobbyist photographers won&#8217;t use Live View.</p>
<h4>Video Recording</h4>
<p>Once in the Live View mode on the D90, you can tap the OK button to begin recording a video clip. While the idea of being able to record video on a DSLR where you can swap out lenses and fine tune advanced settings (things that would only come with a camcorder costing many thousands) is awe-inspiring, the video recording implementation on the D90 has some deal-breaking drawbacks.</p>

<p>Example videos in HD: <a href="http://vimeo.com/1846529">Kickball game pan</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/1739356">Jeep off-roading in Utah</a></p>
<p>In HD mode (720p/24fps in an .avi file) the <strong>D90 can only record a maximum of 5 minutes</strong>, otherwise the CMOS sensor will overheat. Standard definition will let you roll for 20 minutes. Right off the bat, it&#8217;s no replacement for a regular HD camcorder for most uses. <strong>Autofocus only works before you begin recording</strong>, so after it starts recording you&#8217;ll have to manually focus when necessary. And last but not least, <strong>the infamous &#8220;rolling shutter/jelly motion&#8221; issue</strong>. When moving fast, the video appears to flex noticeably. This is due to the <a href="http://www.dslrdad.com/cameras/nikon-d90-d-movie-mode-shoots-jelly-video/">CMOS sensor having a slow read-reset</a> - a general problem with still cameras. You won&#8217;t run into this issue much if you do graceful pans and use a tripod instead of rapidly turning it around.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Video recording, or D-Movie as Nikon calls it, in the D90 is more of a &#8220;look what I can do&#8221; feature rather than a full on replacement for your camcorder. It&#8217;s neat to play around with and record a few short clips, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to have my parents record my college graduation with it.</p>
<h4>Example Shots</h4>
<p>I took the D90 with the VR lens to one of <a href="http://gokickball.com" rel="nofollow">my kickball games</a> and to a Skribit meeting at <a href="http://octanecoffee.com" rel="nofollow">Octane Coffee</a>.

<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>The Nikon D90 is a substantial step-up from its D80 predecessor and boasts features previously only found on the Nikon D300 and D3. However, the D90 is aimed at budding photographers with a bit of money to invest and as such Nikon has added features that point-and-shoot users have come to expect like face detection, live view and video recording. While these features are welcomed additions to the D90, I still think they have some work left before they can even be considered key selling points.</p>
<p>Regardless of those issues, the core still photography utility is fantastic and makes the D90 a great platform for any amateur photographer. Pick up a nice lens and filter and you&#8217;ll be very happy. That being said, I recommend you buy the D90 body alone and pick out your own lens. The <strong>Nikon D90 gets 9 out of 10 Stammys</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have yet to be in a situation to test out the low light and high ISO aspects of the D90, which are apparently amazing.</p>
<p>What else would you like to know about the D90? I&#8217;ll answer in the comments. What do you think is the best all-around lens?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Admittedly, I have been living a happy life in Appleland for the past few years and haven&#8217;t stopped to check out what&#8217;s been brewing in the PC world. Now that I have been tinkering with the HP Pavilion dv4t laptop that I am going to give away, I was a bit surprised by what it could do and what it was packing. I&#8217;ll start off with the basics. The dv4t notebook line is aimed at the student crowd. It starts at under $1,000 for the base model and features a glossy 14.1-inch screen.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_notebook_heli_1200.jpg" title="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_notebook_heli.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"/></a></div>
<p>Fortunately, the model I am going to be giving away is far from the base spec. It boasts <strong>4GB</strong> of RAM, a <strong>2.8GHz</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo processor, Windows Vista Ultimate (if it was mine, I&#8217;d wipe it and go with Ubuntu), GeForce 9200M GS graphics, a <strong>blu-ray</strong> drive, a <strong>320GB</strong> Western Digital hard drive and a <strong>250GB</strong> Hitachi hard drive expansion if you slide out the blu-ray drive. In addition, the dv4t sports an <strong>external Serial-ATA</strong> port and <strong>HDMI</strong> output - pretty spiffy. I&#8217;ve heard of entertainment-oriented notebooks, such as the Voodoo Envy, coming with HDMI and eSATA ports, but not from such a mainstream manufacturer as HP. eSATA makes it very easy to connect a large external disk and retain the speed and minimal overhead of a Serial-ATA connection. The dv4t also packs in a web cam and fingerprint reader.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_right_ports_1200.jpg" title="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_right_ports.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_left_ports_1200.jpg" title="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_left_ports.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"/></a></div>
<p>Aimed at the student slash entertainment crowd means that HP built this computer well-aware that most students use their computer as their only media device. That means it takes the role of TV, internet device and so on. Windows Media Center is at the heart of these functions. When not using the ExpressCard slot, you can stow away a tiny Infrared remote control that can manage Windows Media Center features as well as HP&#8217;s own &#8220;QuickPlay&#8221; center, which takes over Blu-ray playback.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_remote_1200.jpg" title="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop Remote"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_remote.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop Remote"/></a></div>
<p>I tested the HDMI output by hooking it up to my 50-inch Samsung HDTV and it was recognized quickly. When I tried to play a blu-ray movie through the dv4t I ran into a snag saying that the protected media was not allowed to play on the screen, when I know that my HDTV is HDCP-compliant. Then I made the HDTV the primary screen in the Nvidia settings and it worked.. a bit. I kept getting digital distortion as the blu-ray played. See video below:</p>
<div class="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="334" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=60247" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"><param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=412cea6cab&amp;photo_id=2890974222&amp;show_info_box=true"></param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=60247"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=60247" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=412cea6cab&amp;photo_id=2890974222&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true" height="334" width="500"></embed></object></div>
<p>Further investigation proved that the dv4t created such distortion even when not connected to any other display. I only own one blu-ray disc so it&#8217;s hard for me to tell if this is a disc issue or a dv4t issue.</p>
<h4>Usability</h4>
<p>What good are all the aforementioned beefy hardware components if you can&#8217;t use the computer effectively? The dv4t weighs in at a bit over 5lbs, making it a direct competitor to the Apple MacBook, which has been a top student notebook recommendation by various publications since its release. It&#8217;s also a bit thicker than the MacBook. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_logo_night_1200.jpg" title="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_logo_night.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop"/><br/><small>The ridiculously bright HP logo at night. I can see where HP got their influence.</small></a></div>
<p>The biggest drawback of the dv4t is the trackpad. It is impossible to use. It has a slick, fingerprint-loving surface that almost feels sticky. The small trackpad gets in the way of typing and often auto-scrolls when my thumb touches it a little bit. To combat this oft-occurring mishap, they included a button right above the trackpad that allows users to turn the trackpad off when not needed. Couldn&#8217;t they written a smart driver that detects accidental touches? My MacBook Air never has an issue like this and it&#8217;s trackpad is so huge that part of my palm always rests on it when I&#8217;m typing.</p>
<p>Other than that, the recessed keyboard works well. Keys have a bit more travel than a MacBook&#8217;s keys and seem to require a bit more force to activate, but not by much. The headphones jack is appropriately placed in the front of the laptop, albeit directly under where your right wrist usually rests.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_expansion_1200.jpg" title="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop Expansion"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_expansion.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion dv4t Laptop Expansion"/></a></div>
<p>The removable drive bay is by far the best feature of the dv4t. Don&#8217;t need a blu-ray drive right now? Swap it out for a few hundred gigabytes with a hard drive expansion. Don&#8217;t need anything and would rather have a lighter laptop? No problem, just put in the filler slot.</p>
<p>One last nitpick I have with the dv4t deals with the display bezel. It&#8217;s extremely reflective. I have no complaints about the glossy display itself; it&#8217;s a great choice for a media PC with vivid colors and truer blacks. However, the reflective bezel is quite distracting. </p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>Windows Vista rates this particular dv4t a 3.5 Windows Experience Index, with the graphics performance holding the system back. Otherwise, it would earn a 4.7.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hp_dv4t_perf.jpg" alt="HP dv4t Performance"/></div>
<p>A <strong>cold boot takes a whopping 3 minutes and 36 seconds</strong>. This is definitely a mixture of Vista being a resource hog and the default configuration of the dv4t launching a lot of taskbar applications. Shutdown takes only 29 seconds.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the integrated Altec Lansing stereo speakers. They&#8217;re good, for a laptop. Considerably louder than my single-speaker MacBook Air (although that doesn&#8217;t say much), they can fill a small dorm room with sound and pump out enough punch to vibrate the laptop itself. However, at the highest setting the speakers lose all clarity and a considerable amount of noise is introduced while mids are washed out. That being said, there did come a time while watching a blu-ray movie that I kept raising the volume only to find out that they were already on the highest setting.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Technically-speaking, this particular dv4t is stellar. 4GB of RAM, a 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo, a blu-ray drive, loads of storage and the promise of more with an eSATA port. That&#8217;s nothing short of impressive. With the provided 6-cell battery, I clocked in about 2 and a half hours of battery life on a full charge. That&#8217;s about what I would expect with something sporting its high-end hardware.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Vista sucks and is a nightmare to use. As with most OEM laptops, it comes pre-loaded with a bunch of junk software like a NetZero trial, MSN dial-up trial and an annoying Yahoo! toolbar. HP takes up 11.2GB with its own restore partition instead of providing a restore DVD. The dv4t is also quite bulky, but I am definitely biased as I&#8217;m typing this on my MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The HP Pavilion Entertainment PC (dv4t) receives <strong>6.5 out of 10 Stammys</strong>. (8 if it shipped with a respectable operating system)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of a new-fangled viral marketing promotion with Hewlett Packard and marketing agency <a href="http://buzzcorps.com/" rel="nofollow">BuzzCorps</a>, I will be giving away an HP laptop and lots of goodies along with 14 other college-oriented blogs. As you probably caught on from the name of this promotion, it is aimed at college students. </p>
<p>Each participating blog will get a week to run a contest on their site and select a winner. That means you&#8217;ll have 15 chances to win a new system. Each blog will have their own contest rules and entry methods. I haven&#8217;t decided what I&#8217;m going to do for mine but you&#8217;ll find out <strong>October 8th</strong>, when my contest officially begins.</p>

<p>This all started about a month ago when I got an email from a marketing agency hired by HP. They said they noticed I used an HP printer (LaserJet 1012). Rather than quipping &#8220;because Apple hasn&#8217;t made a printer since 1996&#8243;, I decided to see what they were up to. I&#8217;m glad I could help out with this contest. I got to choose between the dv4t, dv5t and dv7t laptops to giveaway. I went with the more portable 14-inch dv4t.</p>
<p>Along with the dv4t laptop, there is a media docking station, 500GB portable hard drive, HP Photosmart C6380 all-in-one printer and messenger bag included for the winner.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jamlegend.com" title="JamLegend">JamLegend</a> is well on its way to becoming the latest online gaming craze. A product of <a href="http://www.launchboxdigital.com/portfolio.html">LaunchBox Digital</a>, a Washington, D.C. based early-stage startup incubator, - sorry, they prefer to be called <em>accelerator</em> - JamLegend brings Guitar Hero style gaming to your browser. No need to buy any fancy controller, your keyboard will do just fine. You can even hold it upside down like a guitar if you so please. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_playing_song_1085.jpg" title="JamLegend Playing Song"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_playing_song.jpg" alt="JamLegend Playing Song"/></a></div>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>True to Guitar Hero style, game play has remained fairly unchanged. You control 5 keys (like guitar frets), and the enter key for strumming when each note arrives. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_how_to_play_880.jpg" title="JamLegend How to Play Guitar"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_how_to_play.jpg" alt="JamLegend How to Play Guitar"/></a></div>
<p>Although, you only generally only need to control 3 keys in easy mode, and so on.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_difficulty.jpg" alt="JamLegend Select Difficulty"/></div>
<p>JamLegend starts getting interesting when you take into consideration some of the multi-player features and achievement system. Each song completed accrues you points as well as improves or hurts your global rating, depending on how your performance compares to your past performances. The global rating is part of a ladder ranking system making it easy to find how you and your friends have been performing compared to each other. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_song_stats_1134.jpg" title="JamLegend Song Stats"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_song_stats.jpg" alt="JamLegend Song Stats"/></a></div>
<p>There are also a number of achievements you can complete that range from hitting a 750-note streak during a game, to inviting 3 friends. These achievements don&#8217;t affect your global rating but nonetheless appear on your profile page and add-on to your number of &#8220;groupies.&#8221; </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_achievements_1106.jpg" title="JamLegend Achievements"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_achievements.jpg" alt="JamLegend Achievements"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_pstamatiou_profile_1005.jpg" title="JamLegend Profile for Paul Stamatiou"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_pstamatiou_profile.jpg" alt="JamLegend Profile for Paul Stamatiou"/></a></div>
<p>There are two forms of multi-player gameplay on JamLegend. You can invite a friend to participate in an asynchronous duel, where each of you complete a game on your own time and the winner is displayed on the duels page. There are also showdowns that are in real-time and players can see each others&#8217; scores as they play. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_duels_1241.jpg" title="JamLegend Duels"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/jamlegend_duels.jpg" alt="JamLegend Duels"/></a></div>
<p>On the order of business, JamLegend does have some links on each game page to purchase the song being played. Also, artists can approach JamLegend and get their songs into the game.</p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>Let me preface this by saying, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/12/02/why-i-dont-play-games-and-what-i-would-play-if-i-did" title="Why I Don't Play Games and What I Would Play If I Did">I am historically not a big gamer</a>. I haven&#8217;t touched my Wii in months. These days I feel like I&#8217;d rather be getting some work done than gaming. Naturally, this is a perfect fit for JamLegend. I don&#8217;t have to go to the living room and turn on a console. I don&#8217;t have to launch a full-screen game. I just have to create a new tab in the web browser I was already using and I can indulge in a no-commitment 4 minute game with ease.</p>
<p>The ability to create duels and easily compete with friends is a big aspect of JamLegend for me. The game is easy enough that I can tell a friend to sign up and we can start playing against each other within minutes. Case in point, I got my sister on JamLegend.</p>
<p>As for nitpicks, sometimes the graphics freeze for a second but the music and game are still going on in the background, causing me to miss a few notes. I attributed this to my MacBook Air and resource-intensive Flash but it also happened once when I introduced Skribit Co-Founder <a href="http://blog.codeeg.com/" title="Calvin Yu">Calvin Yu</a> to it on his MacBook Pro.  Other than that, I&#8217;m just waiting on some more songs to get added to JamLegend.</p>
<p><strong>JamLegend is currently in a closed beta.</strong> Andrew Lee of JamLegend has provided me with a metric ton of invites. The invite URL is in the first comment on this post.</p>
<p>Give it a whirl and let me know what you think.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://getdropbox.com" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> is the recently-launched YCombinator-backed startup that aims to seamlessly sync files between multiple computers as well as act as a conduit for backing up files to <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/21/how-to-live-the-cloud-life" title="How To: Live the Cloud Life">the proverbial cloud</a>. They have been the subject of some <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080914-how-dropbox-ended-my-search-for-seamless-sync-on-linux.html">great reviews</a> and truly deliver what they claim. That being said I don&#8217;t plan on reviewing Dropbox, rather I am going to put out my concerns for why I won&#8217;t be using Dropbox full-time just yet.</p>
<h4>Dropbox Primer</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a PC and a Mac that you constantly share files between. Up until now you might have been emailing files to yourself, made use of file-sharing on a home network, toted around a USB memory stick or shuttled an external hard drive between them constantly (bonus points if you said use JungleDisk sync). Those are all burdensome tasks and aren&#8217;t bulletproof for when each computer is not in the same building. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_sync.jpg" alt="Dropbox Manage Linked Computers"></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_osx_750.jpg" title="Dropbox in OS X"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_osx.jpg" alt="Dropbox in OS X"/></a></div>
<p>Dropbox approaches this problem and goes a step further with shell integration for a Dropbox repository (I say repository out of nature.. dropbox can handle file revisions), shared folders and the like. The OS integration is what is phenomenal about Dropbox, and no OS was left behind: OS X, Linux and Windows are all supported. It&#8217;s much easier to work with than having to open up an FTP application or Amazon S3 client and manually sync or move files. The TortoiseSVN or <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/" title="SCPlugin for SVN in OS X">SCplugin</a>-like UI is a fine touch as well. </p>
<p>In addition to all of that, there is a web interface where you can access your files as well.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_web_interface_768.jpg" title="Dropbox Web Interface"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_web_interface.jpg" alt="Dropbox Web Interface"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_web_interface_photos_839.jpg" title="Dropbox Web Interface for Photos"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dropbox_web_interface_photos.jpg" alt="Dropbox Web Interface for Photos"/></a></div>
<h4>What I&#8217;d Like to See</h4>
<p>Dropbox currently comes with 2GB of free storage, which is in turn stored on their Amazon S3 account which they further secure with their own AES-256 encryption in addition to using SSL before anything is ever sent out. Overall, <strong>I would absolutely, 100% recommend Dropbox</strong> to the regular user that wants to easily sync files between computers while just as easily be able to share them with others. I particularly like being able to right-click a file in the public folder and get a public URL for it.</p>
<p>The seamless integration within the operating system is of paramount importance to the user that would otherwise be clueless to setting up their own S3 account and backing up manually. In the near future Dropbox will sell paid accounts for &#8220;richer sharing options and more storage&#8221; so you won&#8217;t have to worry about 2GB not being enough.</p>
<p>I probably do not represent Dropbox&#8217;s target audience and my concerns are almost on the order of devil&#8217;s advocate but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to see in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control over what is copied to my machine(s) from the cloud</strong> - I have more data on my S3 account than my MacBook&#8217;s hard drive can fit. Naturally, I don&#8217;t want that data on my computer all the time. With Dropbox, currently everything in the &#8220;Dropbox&#8221; folder always remains on my computer. I would rather it only download the file when I try to use, open or edit it.</li>
<li><strong>The ability to just &#8220;disconnect&#8221;</strong> - Expanding on the idea above, I would like the Dropbox folder to disappear when the Dropbox application is closed or if I provide some authentication for it to display/hide.</li>
<li><strong>Use my own S3 account</strong> - I would pay <strong>a lot</strong> to have the ability to store my data in my own S3 account. I realize part of Dropbox&#8217;s business plan likely revolves around charging for storage, but I propose they offer a high-end account where I just pay $30/month for the use of their API to power file revisions, the web interface and all of that, all-the-while being stored on my own S3 account.</li>
<li><strong>My own encryption.</strong> - Adding on to the ability to use my own S3 accounts, I&#8217;d like to supply my own encryption key and have my files encrypted with it. However, this does bring in some technical challenges with Dropbox requiring access to my files to keep track of revisions and the web interface and will likely require Dropbox to have the encryption key as well, which almost defeats the purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Ask Me First</strong> - I would like Dropbox to ask me for my password each time it opens up. I&#8217;d rather not have it be the weak link in my system&#8217;s security and inadvertently give someone that happened to steal my laptop while it was on, access to the gigabytes of data I also store online. However, Dropbox does get points for having the ability to &#8220;unlink&#8221; a computer.<br/>On a related note, I can&#8217;t seem to find a Dropbox entry in the OS X login keychain. It would be easier to secure if credentials were stored there by Dropbox.</li>
<li><strong>Leave no trail behind.</strong> - I&#8217;d like the option to disable &#8220;show deleted files&#8221; and have all deletes be nuclear.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to knock Dropbox by listing out such feature ideas. <strong>Dropbox is the slickest file storage and synchronization solution I have seen, period.</strong> If I wasn&#8217;t as paranoid with security, I would be very, very happy with it. But just think, what would the enterprise do?</p>
<p>Dropbox: Yay or nay?</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I had stir fry with <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/about">Drew, Arash and Aston</a> earlier in the summer.</p>

They have served me well in college and the large subwoofer made for an excellent footrest. However, they are typical &#8220;computer speakers&#8221; in the sense that they don&#8217;t accurately reproduce each frequency and provide too much bass, even with the subwoofer on the lowest setting. I guess you could say I&#8217;ve evolved into an audiophile and have realized that bass isn&#8217;t everything. I like to hear crisp highs and punchy mids as well. That has led me to connect the Logitech&#8217;s to my HDTV for the time being, and upgrade my computer setup with studio monitors.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/rokit_rp5g2s_1200.jpg" title="KRK Rokit RP5G2 Studio Monitors"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/rokit_rp5g2s.jpg" alt="KRK Rokit RP5G2 Studio Monitors"/></a></div>
<h4>Studio Monitors? Never heard of &#8216;em.</h4>
<p>Studio monitors are speakers that have been tuned to have a very flat response. In conjunction with the speakers, a specially built box and baffles to direct the flow of air ensure that no frequency is emphasized more than any other frequency. This ends up producing a sound more akin to how the music you&#8217;re listening to was actually recorded. Of course, if you want to emphasize certain ranges of frequency, you can always do that in post with software equalizers in your music player.</p>
<h4>Introducing the Rokit RP5G2s</h4>
<p>Studio monitors are often sold individually so you usually just buy two, hook them up to your favorite amplifier, pre-amplifier and audio source, and you&#8217;re good to go. That ends up being pretty expensive so I started searching for active/powered studio monitors so I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with having to setup a big amplifier. I remembered hearing my friend <a href="http://estonbond.com" title="Eston">Eston Bond</a>&#8217;s Rokit RP5G1s when visiting Palo Alto over the summer and was thoroughly impressed with the clarity and range they produced.</p>
<p>Since then the KRK Rokit RP5s have been upgraded to their second generation and sport a slightly different style, but offer the same stellar performance. Each monitor runs $150, so that&#8217;s $300 for the pair not including shipping (UPS claims the box was 37lbs). For that price, they are still considered entry level for studio monitors. The 5 in RP5G2 stands for 5-inches - the diameter of the main woofer. KRK also makes versions of these monitors with 6 and 8 inch woofers but they are too big to even consider using on your desk.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/rokit_rp5g2_unboxing_1200.jpg" title="Unboxing of Rokit RP5G2 Studio Monitor"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/rokit_rp5g2_unboxing.jpg" alt="Unboxing of Rokit RP5G2 Studio Monitor"/></a></div>
<p>The RP5G2s feature a 5-inch glass aramid composite woofer and 1-inch neodymium soft dome tweeter with ferro fluid. In layman&#8217;s terms, they are not your typical consumer-aimed speakers. The whole point is that they&#8217;re made for music enthusiasts. Each studio monitor has a 75 watt amplifier built-in, XLR, TRS and RCA inputs, as well as a front-firing bass port.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/rokit_rp5g2_rear_1200.jpg" title="Back of Rokit RP5G2 Studio Monitor"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/rokit_rp5g2_rear.jpg" alt="Back of Rokit RP5G2 Studio Monitor"/></a></div>
<p>At 10-inches deep, 7-inches wide and 11-inches tall, these studio monitors are an entirely different beast compared to the small satellite speakers found with surround sound systems and other such computer speakers.</p>
<h4>Why you should consider an external audio interface</h4>
<p>While it is perfectly possible to hook up these studio monitors directly to any audio source, such as my MacBook Air, it won&#8217;t result in the clearest sound. If I just connect the RP5G2s to my laptop with a 1/4-inch TRS (with separate mono left and right male connectors) to stereo mini-jack cable, the resulting sound will have more noise and interference than it would with an external audio interface (consider it an external sound card) designed to cut out the noise and reduce latency. <strong>Having nice studio monitors and not using an external audio interface is like putting regular octane gasoline in your high-compression engine German sports car. It&#8217;ll work, but you won&#8217;t be getting all the performance you paid for.</strong></p>
<p>There is also the potential for distortion if one&#8217;s not always careful to keep the output to a low level on the computer. That can happen when connecting amplified studio monitors to an amplified headphones output on a computer. </p>
<p>If your computer already has a dedicated sound card like any of the Creative X-Fi offerings, you should be fine. There are a lot of competitors in the external audio interface market, ranging from M-Audio offerings to the seductively-styled <a href="http://www.apogeedigital.com/products/duet.php">Apogee Duet</a>. My needs were that the interface used USB as my Air doesn&#8217;t have FireWire, and that it has TRS outputs for each monitor. I ended up going with the $150 PreSonus Audiobox USB. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/presonus_audiobox_usb_front_1200.jpg" title="Front of PreSonus Audiobox USB"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/presonus_audiobox_usb_front.jpg" alt="Front of PreSonus Audiobox USB"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/presonus_audiobox_usb_rear_1200.jpg" title="Rear of PreSonus Audiobox USB"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/presonus_audiobox_usb_rear.jpg" alt="Rear of PreSonus Audiobox USB"/></a></div>
<p>Fortunately for OS X users, the Audiobox does not require any drivers as it is compatible with Core Audio. Also, you will not be able to control the volume from the OS anymore. This is normal. The Audiobox processes the signal on its own and lets you adjust volume with one of its knobs. Likewise, each Rokit RP5G2 has its own volume knob.</p>
<h4>Putting it all together</h4>
<p>There is one notable downside that comes with this audiophile territory; there are lots of cables. To be exact, each studio monitor requires its own power cable and there are 2 1/4-inch TRS cables coming from the Audiobox with one going to each monitor. In addition the Audiobox also has a USB connection. </p>

<h4>First Impressions</h4>
<p>At an aggregate cost of roughly $450 not including shipping, you&#8217;d expect this audio setup to be a monumental upgrade from your typical pair of so-called computer speakers. You&#8217;be be 100% on the money. <strong>This setup sounds amazing compared to anything I&#8217;ve owned.</strong></p>
<p>At 75 Watts for each studio monitor, some might scoff and think that their 505 Watt 5.1 gaming speakers trump this setup in every way. With their small drivers, traditional computer speakers and surround sound speakers just can&#8217;t compare. Each RP5G2 produces more decibels than such computer speakers can, and more importantly the Rokit&#8217;s make crystal clear sound. <strong>You can hear every guitar strum, every vocalist and every drum hit - just like it was recorded.</strong> There&#8217;s no overpronunciation of bass to drown out the rest of the audio.</p>
<div class="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="334" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=59809" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"><param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=6f9b228ed6&amp;photo_id=2851758144&amp;show_info_box=true"></param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=59809"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=59809" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=6f9b228ed6&amp;photo_id=2851758144&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true" height="334" width="500"></embed></object><br/><small>I know you won&#8217;t be able to hear the audio quality but here&#8217;s a video anyway.</small></div>
<p>The RP5G2s start coming to life at 1/5 volume and keep going. I have yet to put them past 1/2 volume and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever need to, unless I&#8217;m in another room. One thing I like about the Rokits, that others might not like is <strong>the frequency response range: 53Hz to 20kHz</strong>. The key point being that it doesn&#8217;t capture all of the bass; deep bass found in certain songs is around the 20Hz area. I like this because I don&#8217;t want my desk shaking too much, or the walls - I&#8217;ve got neighbors. Fortunately, if you&#8217;re a bass fiend, KRK makes a massive 10-inch subwoofer that can easily be added on to any system.</p>
<p>If I had to point out one aspect of the monitors that really capture my attention, <strong>it would be the tweeters</strong>. They create the high-end treble that I associate with a crisp sound.</p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>With a more professional audio setup, it&#8217;s easier to tell the difference between an MP3 encoded at 128kbps and a track encoded in lossless FLAC or in a near lossless MP3 at 320kbps. However, that is actually almost negligible compared to the difference in audio quality without using the PreSonus Audiobox. I hooked up the Rokit&#8217;s directly to my MacBook Air and proceeded to play some Weezer tracks encoded with FLAC.</p>
<p>Without the external audio interface, there was the a slight, yet definitely still noticeable &#8220;haziness&#8221; to the sound, as if something was blocking it. In other words, there was the addition of noise. A similar noise presence was found when playing a track on my iPod Nano (2nd Gen) compared to playing the same track on my computer through the Audiobox. The addition of the Audiobox as an external audio interface to this setup was well worth it.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with my investment although I&#8217;m thinking the Rokits might be better suited for being hooked up to a Sonos ZonePlayer or Logitech Squeezebox and placed in my living room. Also, one slight annoyance with this setup is that now I must manually turn off each studio monitor and the power switch is on the back as opposed to on some easily accessible controller.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an audiophile are you? What speakers are hooked up to your computer now?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had forums on this site a very long time ago but nothing ever really happened with them. After the prodding of <a href="http://irishaj.com/">Andrew McCuller</a> (a Mac Genius at an Apple Store, among other things), I&#8217;ve decided to <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums" title="PaulStamatiou.com Forums">give forums another whirl</a>. I went with bbPress for its tight integration with WordPress and lightweight footprint. I still have a lot of editing to do but <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums" title="PaulStamatiou.com Forums">it&#8217;s up and running</a>.  </p>
<p>As for my intentions with the forums, I don&#8217;t want them to interfere with the insightful comments and discussions that happen within my blog posts, but rather have it be its own community for discussing anything and everything tech, and then some. You&#8217;ll be able to find out about posts in-the-works, such as an upcoming <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums/topic/upgrading-my-speakers" title="Upgrading My Speakers">audiophile-worthy speaker upgrade</a>, as well as give and receive tech support (and hopefully take it out of my inbox). If you&#8217;re interested, you can <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums/register.php">quickly register here</a></strong>. Registering also means that you will be able to use that same account to comment here, so you don&#8217;t have to keep typing in your name, email and url when you comment.</p>
<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> I didn&#8217;t plan on posting <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/09/live-from-apples-lets-rock-event-in-san-francisco/">about the Apple news today</a>, but <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/forums/topic/ipod-touch-software-update-new-itunes">iTunes 8 and the Genius playlist maker is pretty spiffy</a>. :-)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I boasted about <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/29/pgp-hard-drive-encryption-for-osx">the release of PGP Whole Disk Encryption for Mac OS X</a> and how it is definitely something to consider if data privacy is of utmost importance to you. By encrypting my hard drive, I am able to keep all of my data safe from physical disk access and other such tampering. Since publishing that post I have installed and been using PGP WDE on my MacBook Air for about a week.</p>
<h4>Installation and Configuration</h4>
<p>Setting up PGP WDE had quite a few steps but was a pretty smooth process overall. After installing the actual PGP Desktop application, I was led through creating and publishing a PGP key. When that was done, it was time to embark on the task of actually encrypting my hard drive.</p>
<blockquote><p>PGP Whole Disk provides the next level of security and convenience by encrypting your entire disk. The encryption process can be lengthy, however PGP desktop runs in the background. You may also pause and resume the process at your convenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>All I had to do was select my hard drive, provide a passphrase and it began encrypting my hard drive. As the snippet above explained, <strong>PGP WDE encrypts in the background</strong>, unlike Apple&#8217;s FileVault which locks you out for hours while it encrypts. The entire encryption process took about 2.5 hours on my 1.6GHz MacBook Air, which had 55GB of data in use.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>The first question I get asked when people find out that my hard drive is encrypted is how the performance of my computer is affected with the constant encryption/decryption process going on in the background. <strong>I&#8217;m pleased to report that I have not experienced any negative, discernible performance issues.</strong> It feels exactly the same as before I installed PGP WDE. </p>
<p>Likewise, PGP WDE has not affected my workflow at all. No PGP application needs to be open during normal use. From the in-OS standpoint, you would never know that the hard drive was encrypted. It&#8217;s when you turn on the computer that you&#8217;re faced with a pre-boot authentication screen.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pgp_preboot_auth_osx.jpg" alt="PGP Whole Disk Encryption - Pre-boot Authentication"/><br/><small>Pre-boot Authentication</small></div>
<p>In addition to the PGP key created during setup, a passphrase protects the computer at login. That being said, it&#8217;s important to <strong>pick a lengthy password with lots of entropy</strong>. For example, <strong>to take full advantage of AES 256-bit encryption you must supply a 64-character passphrase</strong>. Otherwise, the passphrase will be the weak link in your hard drive&#8217;s security, not the PGP keypair. Unfortunately, two-factor authentication, such as having the passphrase and a smart card/USB token, is <a href="http://www.pgp.com/products/wholediskencryption/tech_specs.html#smartcards">not supported in WDE for OS X</a>.</p>
<h4>Additional OS X Security</h4>
<p>My only complaint with PGP WDE is that <strong>passphrase authentication is not activated when waking the computer from sleep</strong>. That means that my laptop is most vulnerable when waking from sleep. Granted, it is still protected by OS X&#8217;s own password system. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/osx_login_keychain_security.jpg" alt="OS X Login Keychain Security Settings"/><br/><small>OS X Login Keychain Settings</small></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why <strong>I changed my login keychain settings to lock when sleeping</strong>. That means that even if someone gains access to the system, they will not be able to use any applications that rely on login and password info stored in the OS X login keychain. That includes applications like <a href="http://adiumx.com" title="Adium">Adium</a> and Transmit.</p>
<h4>More Security Paranoia</h4>
<p>A <strong>common attack to gain access to encrypted hard drives</strong> is <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/">the cold boot attack</a> where an attacker exploits a hardware vulnerability in RAM to find encryption keys, and then use those keys to decrypt the hard drive. I contacted PGP about this possibility and they told me that &#8220;it is stored on the MBR encrypted with AES-256.&#8221;</p>
<p>With PGP WDE, your encrypted hard drive is safe from cold boot attacks but that doesn&#8217;t mean someone can&#8217;t find other data in your memory - <strong>if your memory is removable</strong>. PGP WDE&#8217;s pre-boot authentication will prevent someone from rebooting your machine and booting up a live, lightweight Linux distro (such as BackTrack, Auditor, PHLAK and Knoppix-STD) that won&#8217;t disrupt the memory footprint too much and make data recovery from your memory a reality. The MacBook Air has soldered-in RAM chips: horrible from an expansion standpoint, but <strong>great from a security standpoint</strong>.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_ln2_dewar.jpg" alt="185L Dewar of Liquid Nitrogen"/><br/><small>Me with a 185 liter dewar of liquid nitrogen.</small></div>
<p>With soldered-in RAM, people won&#8217;t be able to cool your memory with <strong>liquid nitrogen</strong> (as above) to retain data longer, remove it from your pre-boot authentication-secured system, put it in their computer and copy the contents of the memory before it heats up and flips all the bits. That&#8217;s just a long way of me saying that the <strong>MacBook Air is fairly secure from the hardware perspective</strong>. Even more so if you have a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/14/the-future-of-computing-ssd">Solid State Drive</a> in it. I digress, but SSDs are notoriously bad when it comes to data recovery; that is, bad for you if you legitimately want to recover your data, but good for you when your computer is in the hands of attackers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The algorithms which map addresses to physical media locations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer - and in many cases - like the formula for making Coke or Pepsi - the details are closely guarded commercial secrets.<br/><strong><a href="http://www.storagesearch.com/recovery.html" rel="nofollow">Data Recovery from Flash SSDs?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_ln2_ram.jpg" alt="Liquid Nitrogen Frozen RAM"/><br/><small>RAM chilled with any coolant, such as liquid nitrogen, retains data much longer and makes it easy for cold boot attackers to copy the contents of the RAM for snooping. Without cooling, RAM forgets data within 2 minutes.</small></div>
<p>For <strong>general protection from cold boot attacks</strong>, I recommend turning off your computer when you are in situations that it is possible for someone to gain physical access to your machine, in addition <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/12/06/how-to-quickly-sleep-your-macbook" title="How To: Quickly Sleep your MacBook">to setting your Mac to hibernate mode 0</a>.</p>
<h4>Other PGP Desktop Features</h4>
<p>In addition to whole disk encryption, PGP Desktop provides a slew of security-oriented features. Notable features include encrypted zip files, secure email and AIM messaging and my favorite, <strong>PGP Shred</strong>. PGP Shred securely deletes anything you want and depending on your settings, can exceed the Department of Defense&#8217;s 5220.22-M media sanitization requirements, also known as NISPOM. It&#8217;s not as entertaining as popping CDs in the microwave when the Feds are knocking, but it gets the job done.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Feds, the Federal Trade Commission recently launched <a href="http://onguardonline.gov/" title="OnGuard Online - Your Safety NEt">OnGuard Online</a>, a site providing consumers tips on protecting themselves from online fraud and securing computers.</p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>PGP Desktop&#8217;s support for Whole Disk Encryption for Mac OS X is a user-friendly security sidekick. It does not involve changing the way one works with their computer nor does it affect performance. (By the way, <strong>PGP WDE does not work with BootCamp</strong>). While WDE for OS X does not yet support enterprise-level security in the form of two-factor authentication, it is still highly effective in promoting data security. <strong>PGP WDE receives 10 out of 10 Stammys</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> My reference to the United States government as the &#8220;Feds&#8221; is entirely tongue-in-cheek and pop culture based, not intended to be derogatory or negative in any way, shape or form. Don&#8217;t sue me, I&#8217;m not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lech_Johansen">Jon Lech Johansen</a> (the guy who cracked DVD CSS and whose blog was once entitled &#8220;So Sue Me&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>Is PGP WDE right for you? How do you keep your data secure?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around this time last year, I wrote a <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/08/10/a-realistic-back-to-school-guide-for-college-students" title="A Realistic Back to School Guide for College Students">lengthy post detailing items that incoming college students would need</a></strong> to get settled into their new environment. That article ended up becoming one of the most popular posts I&#8217;ve ever published and garnered lots of link love. So when <a href="http://skribit.com/suggestions/5674">several readers suggested via Skribit</a> that I post a follow up article, I was a little uncertain on how to improve upon the last post. That being said, this <strong>post will focus on upperclassmen</strong>: students that have lived on campus for a year or two and are ready to get their own room and live in an apartment off-campus. </p>
<h4>Last Time..</h4>
<p>Lots of items from my last post still apply - wireless router, a cheap laser printer, digital camera, USB flash drive, graphing calculator, and a pair of headphones - but some of my suggestions have since changed. I now recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WRT54G2-Wireless-G-Broadband-Router/dp/B0014J07R2">Linksys WRT54G2 router</a>. It may not do 802.11n but at $46 it&#8217;s sufficient to supply you and your roommates with Wi-Fi, as well as being considerably smaller than previous models. If you consider yourself a tinkerer, go with the older and larger <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/17/airport-express-goes-n-still-not-a-linksys">WRT54G, which can be upgraded to firmware opening up new capabilities</a>.</p>
<p>As for headphones, I currently enjoy the in-ear <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/09/23/review-sony-mdr-ex71sl-earbuds">Sony MDR-EX71SLs</a>. For digital cameras, I have a feeling the thin <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/16/gadget-envy-sony-cybershot-t700-camera" title="Gadget Envy: Sony Cyber-shot T700 Digital Camera">Sony Cyber-Shot T700</a> will be interesting, but at $400 it is considerably out of the average college student&#8217;s budget.</p>
<h4>Renter&#8217;s Insurance</h4>
<p>For as little as $12 per month you can insure up to $10,000 of your belongings. That will be the best use of your money, ever. <strong>Every single one of my friends has had some sort of run-in with theft during their stay in college.</strong> Theft doesn&#8217;t have to come in the form of a break-in either. One of my friends lived with 6 other guys in a house and it only took one shady &#8220;friend&#8221; to come over one day and steal everything - laptops, a Wii and even textbooks.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/gatech_technique_crimes.jpg" alt="Georgia Tech Crimes on North Campus, 2008"/><br/><small>Living on campus isn&#8217;t much better.</small></div>
<p><strong>Pick your roommates wisely</strong> and don&#8217;t live with anyone you haven&#8217;t known well for at least a year. The last thing you want is to live with a guy you found on CraigsList (also known as my last roommate) who constantly stunk up the house with his illegal substances.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>So you have your own place and can hold the occasional soiree from time to time. Now what? Well you&#8217;re going to need something more powerful than your MacBook&#8217;s speakers to play music. Last year I reviewed the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/06/16/review-slim-devices-squeezebox" title="Review: Slime Devices Squeezebox">Slim Devices Squeezebox</a> and was reasonably impressed. Since then, Slim Devices has been purchased by Logitech and they have just released the <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_boom.html">Squeezebox Boom</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/logitech_squeezebox_boom.jpg" alt="Logitech Squeezebox Boom"/></div>
<p>While I have not personally tinkered with the Squeezebox Boom, the specifications make it seem perfect for the college habitat. Keep it in the common area to jam out to your music library and that of your roommates, as well as listen to Pandora, Rhapsody and other music services. On the other hand you could keep it in your bedroom and use it as an alarm clock.</p>
<h4>Movies</h4>
<p>While I would have no reservations recommending the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/09/30/review-vudu" title="Review: Vudu Movies Box">Vudu box</a> or <a href="http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/">Roku Netflix Player</a>, this still is the college crowd. I&#8217;m better off pointing to my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/12/how-to-download-with-newsgroups" title="How To: Download with Newsgroups">How To: Download with Newsgroups</a> post and leaving it at that.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/03/how-to-100-inch-uber-theater-on-a-budget" title="How To: 100-inch Uber Theater on a Budget"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_100inch_theater.jpg" alt="100-inch Projection Screen and home theater setup"></a></div>
<p>Still on the subject of movies, when I lived with a few roommates I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/03/how-to-100-inch-uber-theater-on-a-budget" title="How To: 100-inch Uber Theater on a Budget">found an affordable used projector and projection screen on CraigsList</a> and converted our living room into a home theater. The entire setup cost less than $200 per roommate and resulted in a 100-inch movie screen. The setup also fared well with Wii parties.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_wii_party.jpg" alt="Nintendo Wii Party - Projector Screen"/></div>
<h4>Water Bottle</h4>
<p>The only downside of living off-campus is that you won&#8217;t have access to the on-campus bus system, if your university offers that, so you will likely have to walk a bit to get to campus. For that twice daily trek, it&#8217;s important to keep hydrated and carry water with you at all times. While <a href="http://www.camelbak.com/index.cfm">Camelbaks</a> and Nalgene bottles are campus favorites, there is a new contender this year: the <a href="http://www.korwater.com/">KOR ONE</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/kor_one_bottle.jpg" alt="KOR ONE Water Bottle"/></div>
<p>The $29 KOR ONE is eco-friendly and made without a nasty plastic production byproduct called &#8220;BPA&#8221; that is found in lower quality polycarbonate water bottles (even less than recent Nalgene bottles had this). Other features include an easy-to-use cap and handle.</p>
<h4>Wireless Keyboard</h4>
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from being in college for over 4 years, it&#8217;s that <strong>there comes a time at least once a semester that I actually want to use my desk for studying</strong> and not just for computing. When that time comes, it is very handy to just push my wireless keyboard to the side and not have to deal with it.</p>
<p>While I can&#8217;t tell you what kind of wireless keyboard you might like, I have been happy with the small-footprint <a href="http://gomeler.com/2008/03/27/review-apple-wireless-keyboard/" title="Review: Apple Wireless Keyboard">Apple Wireless Keyboard</a>.</p>
<h4>Eye-Fi Wireless SD Memory Card</h4>
<p>In my last back to school shopping guide, I recommended new students get an affordable point-and-shoot digital camera to catalog and share their experiences with their friends. Adding on to that idea is the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/07/review-eye-fi-wireless-2gb-sd-card" title="Review: Eye-Fi Wireless 2GB SD Card">Eye-Fi wireless memory card</a> which takes out some of the hassle with uploading pictures. Especially in this day of Facebook this and Flickr that, the automatic uploading afforded by the Eye-Fi card is quite handy for college students.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the other hand, imagine this ideal use case: John is a 21 year old college student and has an Eye-Fi card in a tiny point-and-shoot camera that he takes with him to parties, fraternity functions and so on. At the end of the night, all John has to do is turn on his camera when he gets home and a short while later all of his pictures will be on Facebook. No fidgeting with any confusing photo uploading software or websites.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eye-Fi also makes the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/26/review-eye-fi-explore-geotagging-sd-card" title="Review: Eye-Fi Explore Geotagging SD Card">Eye-Fi Explore, an SD card that also geo-tags photos</a>.</p>
<h4>Chair</h4>
<p>Now that you have your own place, it&#8217;s time to celebrate your freedom from the dorm room and invest in a high quality chair that will last through your graduation and into your graduate school or job years. For me, that chair was a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/06/13/review-herman-miller-celle-chair">Herman Miller Celle</a>. First off, as with anything bearing the Herman Miller name, the Celle is not cheap. It starts at $450 and runs to over $600 depending on configuration. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/hermanmiller_celle_review4.jpg" alt="Review: Herman Miller Celle Chair"/></div>
<p>Unlike run-of-the-mill Ikea chairs, the Celle is completely made with your posture in mind. It&#8217;s a firm chair that keeps your back in line.</p>
<h4>Organization and Study Habits</h4>
<p>While I&#8217;m on the subject of college, I&#8217;ll take this time to reply to three college-related Skribit suggestions; one related to <a href="http://skribit.com/suggestions/268" title="Study Methods - Skribit">study methods</a>, one related to <a href="http://skribit.com/suggestions/5867" title="School Organization - Skribit">organization for back to school</a> and the last related to <a href="http://skribit.com/suggestions/346" title="How do you motivate yourself">how I motivate myself</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Study Methods</strong> - My usual study habits include going to every class (obviously) and taking copious notes in Google Docs (collaboratively if I have any friends in that class). When examination time comes around, I read through my notes once before sleep, then wake up around 4-5am and go through them several more times, all-the-while researching items I don&#8217;t have enough info about.</p>
<p><strong>I avoid pulling all-nighters when possible</strong>. Several of my friends have no problems with all-nighters and even plan them, but there&#8217;s nothing that sucks quite as much as being one of a handful of students pulling out their hair and typing away in a cold library at 4am.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_cs4803doc_allnighter.jpg" alt="All-nighter in the library"/><br/><small>The all-nighter that led to <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/04/21/versatility-made-twitter-what-it-is-today" title="Versatility Made Twitter What It Is Today">this Twitter research paper</a>.</small></div>
<p>If classes don&#8217;t have any assigned textbooks, I&#8217;ll buy a used study guide or textbook relating to the approximate subject matter and use it to research important topics discussed in class, to <strong>get another perspective</strong>. These tactics are fine for non-engineering classes. However, when it comes to physics, math and computer science examinations, excelling on those only comes from paying attention in class and following the exercises, so I can&#8217;t provide too many pointers there.</p>
<p>My takeaway point is that <strong>I study more than what&#8217;s covered in class</strong>. I read the Wikipedia pages of all related topics and the like. <strong>Study groups are incredibly useful</strong> as they help you see things from another perspective and thought process. They also tend to be a huge time sink. I&#8217;ve sat through many study groups thinking that we were just wasting time cracking jokes.</p>
<p>For more thoughts on <strong>being productive in college</strong>, the <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/24548/Being-productive-in-college" title="Being productive in college">comments in this Metafilter post</a> are quite helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong> - Organization is easy for me because <strong>most of my stuff is digital</strong>. I only have one paper notebook this semester and that&#8217;s because the auditorium that class is held in is too cramped to use my laptop comfortably, so I just write down my notes. There are only two things I need to keep track of - upcoming assignment due dates from course syllabus websites, and class notes from Google Docs.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_notepad_todo_list.jpg" alt="To Do List"/></div>
<p>For due dates, <strong>I keep a little notepad on my desk</strong> and periodically check course websites for due dates and make a to-do list every week. I used to use the iPhone app <a href="http://www.culturedcode.com/things/iphone/" title="Things iPhone Application">Things</a> as well as <a href="http://evernote.com/" title="Evernote">Evernote</a> for my to-do lists but I would always forget to check it. Being able to manually scratch out completed tasks provides a nice sense of accomplishment, rather than just clicking off a completed task. As much as I want to lead a completely digital lifestyle, knowing when to use pen and paper is a handy trait.</p>
<p>For more on how I manage my digital life, read <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/21/how-to-live-the-cloud-life" title="How To: Live the Cloud Life">How To: Live the Cloud Life</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - In college, at least some motivation is inherently present for me. I <em>have</em> to do this or that, or I might fail a class and resort to taking the M-train (an ongoing joke at Georgia Tech about switching to the &#8220;easy&#8221; management major from an engineering major - see popular video from Georgia Tech students below).</p>
<p><object width="500" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0NzNKKrYHqY&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0NzNKKrYHqY&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t make mandatory assignments more tolerable with a comfortable working environment. For me this means a nice temperature, lots of light (also helps keep me awake), fast-paced <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=132026">music</a>, and a bit of tea or club soda. Furthermore, <strong>my motivation breaks down into a basic cost-benefit and opportunity cost analysis</strong>. Is it worth my time? How else could I productively use my effort?</p>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/the-printable-ceo/">David Seah&#8217;s Printable CEO</a>:</p>

<p>Some tasks like this blog and working on Skribit are <strong>passion projects</strong>. I indulge in  helping them succeed. I already have all the motivation I need. My motivation for school is all about striving to finish and receive my degree so I can spend all of my time on aforementioned passion projects. In other words, all of my motivation is about <strong>thinking ahead and taking the next step</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are your passion projects?</strong></p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>College has pushed me through various living conditions and now that I&#8217;m in my final semester I happily live by myself and can get my priorities in line. For your viewing pleasure, I present to you <strong>my last four years of college living situations:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_dorm_freshman.jpg" alt="Georgia Tech Glenn Hall Dorm"/><br/><small>Freshman Year: I wasn&#8217;t moving in in this picture, but rather it was a few months into school and I was getting a new roommate. The first roommate assigned to me smelled bad, did drugs and we didn&#8217;t get along too well in general.</small></div>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_dorm_sophomore.jpg" alt="Georgia Tech Woodruff North Dorm"/><br/><small>Sophmore Year: I lived in a &#8220;suite&#8221; which was a 2 + 2 that shared a bathroom. We had setup a desk room and a bed room. That didn&#8217;t work out too well as some of us would need to study while the others wanted to play GameCube. We reverted back to one room with the early birds and one room with the night owls.</small></div>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_twnhouse_junior.jpg" alt="Bedroom"/><br/><small>Junior Year: Moved into an off-campus townhouse with a friend from high school and my neighbor from freshman year, <a href="http://gomeler.com" title="Chris Morrell">Chris</a>.</small></div>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_twnhouse_senior.jpg" alt="Bedroom"/><br/><small>Senior Year: Still in a townhouse but our third one. The first one had a bad case of bed bugs that fumigation couldn&#8217;t kill and the second one was temporary until the larger townhouse we wanted was available. Chris and I got a new roommate as our last one went to work his co-op semester.</small></div>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_twnhouse_senior2.jpg" alt="Living room and roommates playing PS2"/><br/><small>Senior Year: Roommates doing what they do best, playing PS2 all-night.</small></div>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pstam_apt_now.jpg" alt="My current apartment in midtown"/><br/><small>Super Senior Year: My own place finally.</small></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s all too often that laptops are stolen and data like company secrets and employee social security numbers is divulged to unauthorized sources. It&#8217;s not just that; there are a number of reasons why you might want to enforce the privacy of your digital documents. It might have something to do with the U.S. government&#8217;s recent publishing of its policy for <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/08/us_government_p.html">seizing laptops at borders</a> or  maybe the FBI has knocked on your door once before (true story).</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_fbi_card.jpg"/><br/><small>In case you&#8217;ve wondered what an FBI agent&#8217;s business card looks like.</small></div>
<p>I&#8217;m going to take a guess and say that most people have enough information on their hard drive, or accessible through their hard drive (ie, passwords that can be used elsewhere), for a computer-savvy criminal to easily steal their identity.</p>
<p>Taking out the human element, which is still a huge part of security if you&#8217;ve ever read Kevin Mitnick&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Deception-Controlling-Element-Security/dp/076454280X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1219988364&#038;sr=1-1">The Art of Deception</a></em>, <strong>the chances of your identity being stolen from your stolen laptop can be significantly reduced with hard drive encryption</strong>. Apple&#8217;s built-in FileVault home folder encryption doesn&#8217;t count. If Apple built it, they can most likely give certain authorities backdoor access. Well I take that back, there&#8217;s no need, <a href="http://crypto.nsa.org/vilefault/23C3-VileFault.pdf">FileVault has already been cracked</a>.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://na.store.pgp.com/whole_disk_encryption_mac.html">PGP Whole Disk Encryption for OS X</a>. The just released application encrypts your entire hard drive and has pre-boot authentication. </p>
<blockquote><p>PGP Whole Disk Encryption locks down the entire contents of a laptop, desktop, external drive, or USB flash drive, including boot sectors, system, and swap files. The data encryption software continuously safeguards data from unauthorized access, providing strong security for intellectual property, customer and partner data, and corporate brand equity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the details until I test it out this weekend and report back. PGP WDE isn&#8217;t cheap and retails for $120 USD but if you like the idea of hard drive encryption and don&#8217;t mind if it doesn&#8217;t cover your entire OS drive, check out <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Everything has vulnerabilities, potentially even PGP WDE. I am not: a lawyer, a security expert. I am: 22.</p>
<p><strong>What security precautions do you take with your <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum">precious</a> data?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/21/how-to-live-the-cloud-life" title="How To: Live the Cloud Life">Living the cloud life</a> is only part of the equation; traveling light and easily being able to move your workspace from your home to class, a <a href="http://octanecoffee.com/">coffee shop</a>, a coworking space or office are just as important. That&#8217;s why I use a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/20/review-macbook-air" title="Review: MacBook Air">MacBook Air</a> and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve gotten my hands on some fine examples of small computer bags for light computing. </p>
<h4>Meet the Contestants</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_mba_bags_1024.jpg" title="Bags for the MacBook Air - from Waterfield and Tom Bihn"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_mba_bags.jpg" alt="Bags for the MacBook Air - from Waterfield and Tom Bihn"/></a></div>
<p><strong>Left to Right:</strong> <a href="http://www.sfbags.com/products/sleevecases/sleevecases.htm">WaterField SleeveCase</a> (with flap, piggyback and strap), <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0300">Tom Bihn Horizontal Brain Cell</a> (with TerraGrip strap), <a href="http://www.sfbags.com/products/hardcase/hardcase.htm">WaterField HardCase</a>, <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0223">Tom Bihn Ristretto</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for this post sprouted from Tom Bihn. They approached me about reviewing one of their bags to which I replied &#8220;what do you have that fits the Air?&#8221; From there I browsed around and looked for similar &#8220;light&#8221; bags to add to this review. The only one that I could not get my hands on in time was the <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/laptop/coder/size/2/">13-inch &#8220;Coder&#8221; by Timbuk2</a>.</p>
<p>I did not include my bag of choice for the last year, a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/01/23/whats-in-my-bag">15-inch Timbuk2 messenger bag</a>, as it is too large to include in any sort of light computing bag review.</p>
<h4>Tom Bihn Horizontal Brain Cell</h4>
<p>At $60 (not including shoulder strap), the <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0300">Brain Cell</a> is a no-frills, gets-the-job-done laptop tote. It provides a good amount of laptop protection at the expense of leaving room for little else. There is a front pouch which potentially could be used for the charger and occasional day planner, but nothing else. Then again, that&#8217;s the whole point of computing light.. you don&#8217;t need much else! If you could really use an extra pouch or two, Tom Bihn sells those as attachable add-ons (pictured above).</p>
<p>My only real criticism is that the Brain Cell&#8217;s handles are wimpy compared to the structure of the rest of the bag, which makes it a bit awkward to use as a briefcase. I&#8217;m used to the solid handle found on Timbuk2 bags.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_braincell_closed_1024.jpg" title="Tom Bihn Horizonal Brain Cell laptop bag"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_braincell_closed.jpg" alt="Tom Bihn Horizonal Brain Cell laptop bag"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_braincell_top_1024.jpg" title="Tom Bihn Horizonal Brain Cell laptop bag"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_braincell_top.jpg" alt="Tom Bihn Horizonal Brain Cell laptop bag"/></a></div>
<p>The top of the Brain Cell closes with two overlapping, velcro-equipped flaps. I found myself struggling with this a bit by first having to push down the lower flap and pull across the top flap to get an adequate close that wouldn&#8217;t come apart.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Something about the boxy, geometric styling doesn&#8217;t do it for me.</p>
<h4>Tom Bihn Ristretto</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0223">Ristretto</a> is a vertical messenger bag priced at $90 with a bit more room to spare. It has considerably less padding than the Brain Cell or any of the other bags in this review but definitely enough to keep your laptop safe from coffee-table falls. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_ristretto_open_1024.jpg" title="Tom Bihn Ristretto Vertical Bag"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_ristretto_open.jpg" alt="Tom Bihn Ristretto Vertical Bag"/></a></div>
<p>As you can see the Ristretto maintains a small profile while affording the storage space for an extra notepad, book and miscellaneous items. It&#8217;s like a 2+2 sports car - there&#8217;s extra space in the back, but not enough to get carried away with.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_ristretto_vert_1024.jpg" title="Tom Bihn Ristretto Vertical Bag"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_ristretto_vert.jpg" alt="Tom Bihn Ristretto Vertical Bag"/></a></div>
<p>I was never a fan of vertical messenger bags but I found myself taking this one to class more than any of the other bags. I attribute this to the smaller ground footprint. It doesn&#8217;t take up much floor space in cramped auditoriums and people won&#8217;t trip over it when squeezing by you to get to their seat (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Georgia_Tech_College_of_Architecture.jpg">College of Architecture</a> Auditorium 123 I&#8217;m looking at you!).</p>
<p>While I generally only need my MacBook Air, I tend to pack a notepad and pen for classes just in case. For having the room to accomodate this, the Ristretto gets bonus Stammy points.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> While not exactly the epitome of light computing, the Ristretto is solid, versatile performer.</p>
<h4>WaterField Hardcase</h4>
<p>If the last two bags were the Toyota Camry and Infiniti G37 (respectively) in the crowd, the <a href=http://www.sfbags.com/products/hardcase/hardcase.htm">WaterField HardCase</a> would most likely be a Bentley Brooklands. Made with genuine leather and starting at $229 for the MacBook Air sized version, the HardCase is built for the businessman. Like the Bentley, the HardCase has a plush interior with <strong>loads of padding</strong>. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_hardcase_front_1024.jpg" title="Waterfield MacBook Air Hardcase"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_hardcase_front.jpg" alt="Waterfield MacBook Air Hardcase"/></a></div>
<p>You will never have to worry about your laptop&#8217;s safety again. You could even trust your laptop with, dare I say, airport baggage handlers in this bag. I had originally considered this extra bulk to be a downside, but I don&#8217;t think extra padding is ever a bad thing.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_hardcase_open_1024.jpg" title="Waterfield MacBook Air Hardcase"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_hardcase_open.jpg" alt="Waterfield MacBook Air Hardcase"/></a></div>
<p>Unfortunately the amenities stop there. There is no room for much more than a few pens and a pack of gum. It&#8217;s a tight fit for everything else, including the laptop charger.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I&#8217;ll take one in white to match my Gulfstream. Realistically though, I took this bag a few times with me to tech events and meetups but that was about it. It is still a big bag but pretty much only holds the laptop. There must be a way to engineer a small pocket to hold a legal pad. Save your money and entertain some young ladies with bottle service at your local upscale bar.</p>
<h4>WaterField SleeveCase Ensemble</h4>
<p>Last in this review shootout, I have the <a href="http://www.sfbags.com/products/sleevecases/sleevecases.htm">WaterField SleeveCase</a> with all the fixings: a flap, shoulder strap and piggyback pouch. As the name implies, the SleeveCase is literally just a protective sleeve for your laptop. With the added piggyback pouch, it easily takes on the challenge of toting along your laptop charger as well.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_sleevecase_1024.jpg" title="Waterfield Sleevecase Ensemble bag"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_sleevecase.jpg" alt="Waterfield Sleevecase Ensemble bag"/></a></div>
<p>The SleeveCase is the smallest bag of the bunch and was my bag of choice when going to <a href="http://skribit.com" title="Skribit">Skribit</a> meetings and development sessions where all I needed was my laptop and charger, and didn&#8217;t want to tote along a big bag.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_sleevecase_open_1024.jpg" title="Waterfield Sleevecase Ensemble"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_sleevecase_open.jpg" alt="Waterfield Sleevecase Ensemble"/></a></div>
<p>With neoprene protective padding and a ballistic nylon exterior, the SleeveCase felt rugged enough to take care of my laptop while not adding too much bulk. That being said, the SleeveCase won&#8217;t entirely protect your laptop from any substantial staircase falls or the like.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The SleeveCase Ensemble is my favorite of the bunch, although the Tom Bihn Ristretto isn&#8217;t far with its added versatility.</p>
<h4>Your Thoughts</h4>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it, I&#8217;m in love with the cloud. <a href="http://twitter.com/ethank/statuses/864837553">Some people</a> might not share my fascination with storage-in-the-cloud and compute-in-the-cloud models but I can&#8217;t wait to have the same computing experience regardless of the computer or device I&#8217;m using to connect to the Internet. I&#8217;ve taken it upon myself to change my workflow and digital lifestyle to get as much of my data online and make use of web-based tools until that utopian time comes. Here&#8217;s how I do it and you can do the same. [Thanks to <a href="http://www.parisim.net/">Paul Simpson</a> for suggesting this post.]</p>
<h4>Fat Pipe</h4>
<p>The first step to living the cloud life is having a fast Internet connection at your primary residence. Fast in this context applies more to your upload speed than your download speed. Subsisting on the cloud generally implies initially uploading your data to various sources online (described later) and syncing or doing smaller updates from then on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Fiber-To-The-Home Internet connections are not offered everywhere. If you&#8217;re really ready to jump in, you can generally get a business class cable connection with about 5mbps of constant upload bandwidth for around $90 USD (in the United States at least). Otherwise, you could also attend a top university where you will no doubt be offered a top-notch connection in the dorms or at least the library. For example, Georgia Tech ties directly into <strong><a href="http://www.usg.edu/peachnet/fiber.phtml" title="PeachNet">PeachNet</a>, a Georgia-wide 2Gb/s fiber network connecting universities</strong>.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls/2782384280/" title="midtown atlanta fiber optic"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_bandwidth_august.png" alt="Paul Stamatiou DirecPath Bandwidth"/></a></div>
<p>As I have mentioned countless times before, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/24/my-internet-connection-maxed-out-80211g">my current connection is a FTTH offering by DirecPATH</a>, capable of over 80mbps down and over 20mbps up during non-peak times. It makes being on the cutting-edge of cloud life all the easier.</p>
<h4>Email</h4>
<p>What&#8217;s the most important thing you need to be able to access everywhere? Email. And if its not, I would like to know what is the most important thing for you online. When Google released Gmail For Your Domain in early 2006 and subsequently the <a href="http://google.com/a">Google Apps suite</a> later that year, I switched over from Gmail. Google Apps lets me use Google&#8217;s secure servers and pristine webmail interface with my own email address in addition to providing a suite of applications like Google Docs and Google Calendar.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/23/review-zimbra-webmail" title="Review Zimbra Webmail">Zimbra&#8217;s webmail offering</a> can be considered superior to Gmail/Google Apps Gmail by some, it&#8217;s a bit too much for me. Furthermore, the <strong>Google Apps suite is the hub of my workplace</strong>.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_google_apps_1124.jpg" title="PSTAM.com Google Apps Gmail - Accounts"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_google_apps.jpg" alt="PSTAM.com Google Apps Gmail - Accounts"/></a></div>
<p>I import all of my email accounts into my Google Apps Gmail account. For my Georgia Tech email address, I would rather not have it get mixed in with my primary inbox so I created a filter that archives emails sent to my school address to a Georgia Tech label that I check regularly. </p>
<p><strong>Why is webmail better? </strong> I don&#8217;t like having Mail.app or Thunderbird open at all times consuming system resources or making bootup times any bit longer than they need to be. Furthermore, if my laptop is somehow compromised anyone would be able to look at thousands of  saved emails on the hard drive. If my laptop is ever stolen, and worst case scenario already on and logged in, I would be able to go to another computer and sign out all of my Gmail sessions, thus securing my email archives from a potential identity thief.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_google_apps_signout.jpg" alt="PSTAM.com Google Apps Gmail - Signout of Sessions"/></div>
<p>As for other reasons to use Google Apps, you can sync your Google Contacts with your iPhone through iTunes. In addition, <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/07/google-calendar-adds-caldav-support.html">Google recently added support for CalDAV</a> to their Calendar app, should you be so inclined to use iCal and have it sync with Google Calendar.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Documents</h4>
<p>Continuing with the Google Apps theme, I maintain and work on most documents with Google Docs. The exception being work documents <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/03/03/startup-101-tools-for-the-job" title="Startup 101: Tools for the Job">that are stored on a company Basecamp account</a> and documents I don&#8217;t access often. Ever since Google added PDF support, I have begun storing my PDFs (things like technical reference) on Google Docs. This gives me quick access to a rudimentary PDF viewer, as well as access to the original file. You can&#8217;t get cheaper than free document hosting.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/google_docs_update2.jpg" alt="Google Docs"/></div>
<p>If you use <a href="http://gears.google.com/" title="Google Gears">Google Gears</a>, you can work with Google Docs in offline environments. Other documents that I don&#8217;t need to access often are stored on Amazon S3, described later in this article. </p>

</ul>
<h4>Precipitate: Google Docs, locally</h4>
<p>To complement my Google Docs workflow, I use a <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/precipitate/" title="Precipitate">Mac application called Precipitate</a></strong>. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_google_docs_precipitation.jpg" alt="Precipitate for Google Docs"/></div>
<p>Simply put, it logs into my Google Docs account and creates Spotlight-indexable executables correlating to each document.  This allows me to search locally for documents on my Google Docs account and then launch those documents in my browser.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_google_docs_precipitate_settings.jpg" alt="OS X Precipitate Settings"/></div>
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked about it many times before - I use Amazon S3 to store the bulk of my data online. Being the control freak that I am, I manually manage my files on S3 with <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/" title="Transmit">Transmit</a> for OS X (<a href="http://s3hub.com/" title="S3Hub">S3Hub</a> is free though). I imagine that most people will be content with an application like <a href="http://jungledisk.com">JungleDisk</a>, as described in <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/08/how-i-use-amazon-s3" title="How I Use Amazon S3">How I Use Amazon S3</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why&#8217;s that?</strong> JungleDisk can automatically sync files and provides a more user-friendly front-end with WebDAV. Just drop your files into a folder on your desktop.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked about my Amazon S3 uses numerous times in the past so I&#8217;ll just link to related articles. If you maintain your own server be sure to check my article about how I backup my server.</p>

</ul>
<p>As for other backup utilities, I&#8217;ve heard good things about <a href="http://getdropbox.com" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> but haven&#8217;t yet tested it out first hand.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Ah yes, my favorite category. <strong>How do I access my music library regardless of where I am and what computer I have?</strong> I use a few tools but I&#8217;ll begin with <strong><a href="http://ridethebandwagon.com/home.html">Bandwagon</a></strong>. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_bandwagon_itunes_backup.jpg" alt="Bandwagon backup iTunes to Amazon S3"/></div>
<p>Bandwagon lets me not only backup my iTunes library and all of <a href="http://forum.ridethebandwagon.com/forums/4/topics/49">its related metadata</a> (ratings, play counts and all of that fluff) to Amazon S3 but also sync between multiple computers. I only use one computer primarily so Bandwagon serves the role of iTunes backup for me. Bandwagon backs up <strong>everything</strong> including movies, music videos, TV shows, iPod games and DRM-protected iTunes Store songs.</p>
<p>Next up, I also use <strong><a href="http://anywhere.fm" title="Anywhere.FM">Anywhere.FM</a></strong>. With Anywhere.FM I can put my entire iTunes library online, complete with playlists. That is, so long as my library is only MP3 files - currently the only supported file format. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_anywherefm_uploader_800.jpg" title="Anywhere.FM Uploader - Using iTunes library"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_anywherefm_uploader.jpg" alt="Anywhere.FM Uploader - Using iTunes library"/></a></div>
<p>The primary benefit is being able to access my music from any computer simply by logging into a website and using their familiar, almost iTunes-like player. In addition, Anywhere.FM lets me share playlists with friends.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_anywherefm_1345.jpg" title="Anywhere.FM account for Paul Stamatiou"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_anywherefm.jpg" alt="Anywhere.FM account for Paul Stamatiou"/></a></div>
<p><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_simplifymedia_iphone.jpg" alt="Simplify Media for iPhone" align="right" style="padding-left:5px;"/>When I&#8217;m on the move but still want access to my entire iTunes library, there is <a href="http://www.simplifymedia.com/iphone20.html"><strong>Simplify Media</strong> and their accompanying iPhone app</a>. After creating an account and installing Simplify Media on my computer and iPhone, I can stream all of my music to my iPhone instantly. However, more often than not I just fire up the Pandora iPhone application instead.</p>
<p>For the times when I get tired of my own music collection I usually head to <a href="http://pandora.com">Pandora</a>, <a href="http://thesixtyone.com">TheSixtyOne</a> or <a href="http://thefeelgood.com">TheFeelGood</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Photo Editing</h4>
<p>Now that productivity needs have been covered with Google Apps, I have the occasional need for quick photo-editing for a blog post. My general photo-editing needs include cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and applying a slight unsharp mask. Fortunately, current web-based photo editors are easily capable of such tasks.</p>
<p>The two that come to mind are <a href="http://a.viary.com">Aviary Phoenix</a> (free) and <a href="http://photoshop.com/express" title="Photoshop Express (PSX)">Photoshop Express</a> (free).</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_f40_1279.jpg" title="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_f40.jpg" alt="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"/></a><br/><small>Aviary Phoenix Image Editor</small></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_photoshop_express_r8_1346.jpg" title="Photoshop Express"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_photoshop_express_r8.jpg" alt="Photoshop Express"/></a><br/><small>Photoshop Express Image Editor</small></div>
<p>If I have the luxury of being on a computer with Photoshop installed, I won&#8217;t hesitate to use it instead of a web-based tool but for simple tasks the difference is becoming negligible.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/07/first-impressions-aviary-app-suite" title="First Impressions: Aviary App Suite">First Impressions: Aviary App Suite</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Photos</h4>
<p>I keep all of my photos on <strong><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls">Flickr</a></strong>. Easy as pie. I don&#8217;t shoot in RAW, which Flickr doesn&#8217;t support anyway, so I don&#8217;t have any problems. The more involved photographers that want to keep their original RAW files need to find their own backup solutions. A few photographers I know use Adobe Lightroom and retain all original RAW files on either a custom RAID hard drive setup or a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/Where_to_Buy/Index.html">drobo storage array</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls" title="Paul Stamatiou on Flickr"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_flickr_sets.jpg" alt="Paul Stamatiou Flickr Sets"/></a></div>
<p>Of course, RAW images are just files as well and can just as easily be stored on Amazon S3. Unfortunately, it isn&#8217;t easy to preview thousands of photos stored on an S3 account without some yet-to-be-developed software that knows how to deal with such files and a front-end that can preview them in a photographer-friendly way. I&#8217;m waiting on Adobe Lightroom Hosted™ before I tinker with uploading RAW files.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Browser Config, Syncing</h4>
<p>Last but not least - the user experience afforded by one&#8217;s main browser. You know what I&#8217;m talking about. Going from your customized Firefox configuration with tons of bookmarks and extensions to a clean, untouched Firefox install at your campus library just feels weird. For the first issue of taking care of bookmarks, I use the delicious add-on and <em>Cmd+D</em> <a href="http://delicious.com/pstamatiou" title="Paul Stamatiou's Bookmarks on Delicious">my bookmarks to the web</a>.</p>
<p>Then there is <strong><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave">Mozilla Weave</a></strong>. Weave is a Firefox add-on that allows users to sync a lot of their browser&#8217;s data and configurations in hopes of being able to provide the same browser experience regardless of the computer. It is an early-stage Mozilla Labs product but I think it will be <strong>something to watch</strong> in the coming months.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pstam_weave_settings.jpg" alt="Mozilla Weave Settings"/></div>
<p>Weave registration is currently closed as it seems Mozilla&#8217;s services server has reached its load limit. On the bright side, Weave uses a fairly standard WebDAV configuration with user authentication to store data, <strong>so you can make your own Mozilla Weave server</strong>. That being said, I&#8217;ve tried many times and I can&#8217;t get Weave to accept my configuration. Consider this a work in progress.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in creating your own Mozilla Weave server, you can change the username by going to <em>about:config</em> in Firefox and then changing the value of <em>extensions.weave.username</em>. Enter in your desired username, setup a WebDAV server (link below), provide Firefox the URL in the Weave preferences and hypothetically you should be set. Once I can nail down a solid Weave server config, I&#8217;ll be sure to write about it here.</p>
<p><strong>If anyone can setup and configure a Weave-friendly distro with user authenticated WebDAV over HTTPS, I&#8217;d love to use it as an <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/04/05/how-to-getting-started-with-amazon-ec2">Amazon EC2 image</a>.</strong> It probably wouldn&#8217;t be too hard to setup an EC2 Weave server and sell out spots to users for a few dollars..</p>

<h4>Thoughts on Living the Cloud Life</h4>
<p>Living in the cloud, as trite and overused as that already sounds, is not for everyone. Even if everyone had gigabit connections, there is not yet enough software or innovative web services to take advantage of cloud-hosted personal files and media. Time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use the cloud or dare I say, gasp, &#8220;cloud technology?&#8221;</strong><br />
If you read this far, what&#8217;s your favorite type of cloud? I quite fancy lenticular clouds and clouds shaped like elephants.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next gadget in my sights is actually a point-and-shoot camera. But why the downgrade from the DSLR? Nope, I&#8217;m not looking for a DSLR replacement - rather a complement. There are just some situations where a DSLR doesn&#8217;t make sense and I&#8217;ve come to learn that in the last year. Enter the upcoming Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T700. A point-and-shoot digital camera that is  actually gawk-worthy.</p>

<p>At a retail price of $399 it&#8217;s almost within entry-level DSLR territory but its price brings some impressive features. For example, it&#8217;s <strong>only 5/8-inch thick</strong>. It has 4GB of internal memory, a 3.5-inch touch screen, 10.1MP of resolution and image stabilization to help out with picture quality. </p>

<p>The feature I&#8217;m really looking forward to is the integrated photo album software. <strong>This is <em>exactly</em> how I use my iPhone.</strong> I have over 1,800 photos on my iPhone, all which have been taken with the iPhone. It has come in extremely handy in social situations.</p>
<p>Exhibit A:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah man I saw a Nissan GT-R in the wild today!<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Nice! I saw one at display at the Detroit Auto Show this year during press week and have some shots of the interior [flip through photos on iPhone].<br />
<strong>Jake:</strong> Man, I need to get an iPhone.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Yeah you do.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Exhibit B:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Courtney:</strong> So how was your camping trip?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Let me show you.. [flipping through photos]<br />
<strong>Courtney:</strong> Is that a raccoon?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Not just any raccoon, the one that tried to bite me.<br />
<strong>Courtney:</strong> Maybe it wouldn&#8217;t have tried to bite you if you didn&#8217;t waste time taking a picture of it.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Touché.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with relying on my iPhone for this utility is that it wasn&#8217;t built for this. At 1,800+ photos, the image database is large and even opening the photos app takes a good wait. I&#8217;d happily let the  T700 take care of this task for me. As for space concerns, the T700&#8217;s album software lets you downsize original photos and retain smaller versions just for the purpose of keeping and displaying on the camera.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the T700&#8217;s improved &#8220;smile shutter&#8221; technology detects faces and furthermore, smiles, and snaps a photo when everyone is smiling. The related feature &#8220;anti-blink&#8221; takes two photos and compares them, saving the one where the subject is not blinking. Impressive.</p>
<p>Why is it that only consumer-aimed point-and-shoot cameras get these type of features? I suppose it has something to do with the fact that DSLR prosumers tend to know enough about tweaking their camera manually that they probably wouldn&#8217;t use such features.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your point-and-shoot camera of choice?</strong> I envision the T700 being a take anywhere type of camera for me, similar to my MacBook Air. Of course, that assumes I can find $400 to pick up the DSC-T700, which can be pre-ordered starting August 29th.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s finally happening. A big tech event I&#8217;ve actually heard about before is coming to Atlanta. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://2008.webjamsession.com/" title="Webmaster Jam Session">Webmaster Jam Session</a> and it is a forum for designers, developers and the rest of the lot to exchange knowledge and socialize. I usually don&#8217;t use my blog to spread the word about events like this but I&#8217;m rather excited to finally  learn from and meet web legends I&#8217;ve followed online for quite some time. I&#8217;ll backtrack a bit first and explain Webmaster Jam Session.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://2008.webjamsession.com/" title="Webmaster Jam Session"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/webmasterjamsession_atl.jpg" alt="Webmaster Jam Session comes to Atlanta"/></a></div>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;ll just quote what&#8217;s on their website.</p>
<blockquote><p>A two day event with some of the best Web designers, developers, marketers and visionaries in the world. Learn about the latest ideas and trends in Web design, development, search engine optimization, and social media. You will make new friends, get answers to your questions, learn a lot, and be inspired</p></blockquote>
<p>Some speakers I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting include <a href="http://sonspring.com">Nathan Smith</a>, <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/">Dan Rubin</a>, <a href="http://jeffcroft.com">Jeff Croft</a> and <a href="http://chrispederick.com">Chris Pederick</a> (remember the Firefox web developer extension?). Now to the point of this post: there are limited spots so if you even live a few states over, definitely consider attending. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not often we get this kind of thing in Atlanta. Thanks to <a href="http://www.coffeecup.com/">CoffeeCup&#8217;s</a> J Cornelius for letting me know about this!</p>
<p><strong>What was the last tech/web dev conference you&#8217;ve attended?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I don&#8217;t receive any kind of compensation for spreading the word about Webmaster Jam Session, I just want people to experience it too. That being said, if you use the code &#8220;BLUEDOG&#8221; it&#8217;ll take 20% off registration.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not too long ago <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/25/macbook-air-susceptible-to-gravity">I accidentally dropped my MacBook Air</a> onto a hard floor and the screen cracked. I knew that I did not have the time or patience to let Apple take it away for repair for what, in my experience, would be at least two weeks (not to mention the exorbitant cost). I ended up putting <a href="http://www.techrestore.com">TechRestore.com</a> to the test after a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/25/macbook-air-susceptible-to-gravity#comment-166219">suggestion from a reader</a> (Thanks <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/mkrieger/" title="Mike Krieger">Mike</a>!). </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_label_1024.jpg" title="TechRestore Box Label"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_label.jpg" alt="TechRestore Box Label"/></a></div>
<p>TechRestore pride themselves with affordable service and fast turnaround time. For a standard <a href="http://www.techrestore.com/xcart/product.php?productid=18266&#038;cat=273&#038;page=1">MacBook Air screen replacement</a>, they charge $399 USD. The best part is that they promise a 24-hour replacement, not including any shipping time. For a bit more ($69) they offer door-to-door overnight shipping but if you&#8217;re fine shipping it yourself and receiving return overnight shipping it&#8217;s only an extra $29. I went with the all-inclusive shipping option and they sent me a padded box overnight.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_box_1024.jpg" title="TechRestore Box"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_box.jpg" alt="TechRestore Box"/></a></div>
<p>After getting the box to fit my Air by taking out a few slices of the padding, I filled out a little sheet detailing my problem. In my case, I just checked that it was going in for a screen replacement. The sheet also had other areas for providing login credentials, should they need access to the OS. I did not need to provide TechRestore any passwords but I did turn on FileVault to encrypt my home directory, which I always do when handing away my computer to anyone else.</p>
<p>I sent out my laptop to TechRestore on a Wednesday afternoon and received it back that Monday afternoon. To TechRestore&#8217;s credit, they had finished working on it Thursday, the same day they received it, but the weekend came before FedEx could bring it to Texas from California.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>So how was their service? Frankly, I was pretty disappointed at what I saw when I opened up the box. The new screen was put in properly and working, but the bezel around the screen was bent and popping out. The Air did not close completely due to the bezel popping out of the top right corner. In addition, the lower right corner of the new screen had some small white spot on it. Not a pixel problem but some other type of panel or filter issue. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_bent_1024.jpg" title="MacBook Air Bezel Bent"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_bent.jpg" alt="MacBook Air Bezel Bent"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_corner_1024.jpg" title="MacBook Air Bezel Sticking Out"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_corner.jpg" alt="MacBook Air Bezel Sticking Out"/></a></div>
<h4>Take Two</h4>
<p>I let TechRestore know that I wasn&#8217;t too happy with the work performed and they let me know what had happened. They put a special note on my order to get it out faster than usual, seeing as how I was going to review their service, and that did not provide enough time for the screen bezel&#8217;s adhesive to set.</p>
<p>They offered to fix their work and email me a shipping label. I shipped out the MacBook Air in the same box that day and received the Air back in 3 days (Tuesday to Friday). </p>
<p>The final repair was much more satisfactory, although I had hoped for a bezel replacement rather than a refitting. Once the aluminum bezel is bent, it is hard to get it flat again and I was still able to spot and feel the ripples in the bezel, although more subtle.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_bezel_take_two_1024.jpg" title="MacBook Air Screen Bezel Still Bent"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_bezel_take_two.jpg" alt="MacBook Air Screen Bezel Still Bent"/></a></div>
<p>The top right corner of the screen displayed light scratches from labor to fit the bezel properly. My only concern with those scratches is that if I ever take my laptop to Apple for an unrelated service, they might believe I tampered with it and void my warranty.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_corner_scratch_1024.jpg" title="MacBook Air Corner Scratched"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_corner_scratch.jpg" alt="MacBook Air Corner Scratched"/></a></div>
<p>TechRestore did also replace my screen a second time. The white spot from the previous panel was gone. However, I was let down once again when I spotted a blue dead pixel along the right side of the screen. Although I will say that the absolute edge of the screen is the best place to have a dead pixel if I had to choose.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_dead_px_1024.jpg" title="MacBook Air Screen Dead Pixel"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/techrestore_air_dead_px.jpg" alt="MacBook Air Screen Dead Pixel"/></a><br/><small>Blue dead pixel on the right. That white dot is just dust.</small></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if TechRestore runs any diagnostics on new hardware, such as installing the screen and running software to flash random background colors, making it easy to spot dead pixels, but it would have caught something like that.</p>
<p>On the upshot, they were able to flatten a dent on the top of my Air from the drop.</p>
<h4>Worth it?</h4>
<p>Overall, I liked TechRestore&#8217;s speed of service and price but the quality was a bit shy of my expectations. In their defense, I am a pretty picky person and am a dash of perfectionist. I have no doubt that most people would be more than happy with TechRestore&#8217;s service. However, I did pay top dollar for the MacBook Air mainly for aesthetic reasons and have certain expectations of repair services for it.</p>
<p>If I had gone to Apple, they would have charged somewhere around $800 USD but would have replaced the entire top assembly - screen, bezel and top cover. Then again, Apple would have taken a lot longer. Compromises, compromises..</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever used any such Mac repair services? Have you ever broken or cracked a laptop screen? How did you fix it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure: TechRestore covered these repair expenses for this review.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a new kid on the block when it comes to web-based applications for creatives. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://a.viary.com/">Aviary</a> and I don&#8217;t believe I have ever seen anything like it. Aviary is soon to become a powerful brand. They are developing a massive suite of such Adobe Flex-based applications. I first heard about Aviary through a <a href="http://skribit.com/blogs/paulstamatiou-com">Skribit suggestion on my blog</a> many months ago.  Aviary has since opened a few applications like Phoenix (image editing) and Peacock (pattern maker) to beta testers and many more are in the works.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_apps_760.jpg" title="Aviary Application Suite"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_apps.jpg" alt="Aviary Application Suite"/></a></div>
<p>Each application totes an imaginative name and icon related to some type of bird. They deal with everything from &#8220;image editing to typography to music to 3D to video.&#8221; In addition, the main site A.viary.com creates a community around users sharing their creations, as well as the source files so others can tinker. That&#8217;s something I would come to expect from the <a href="http://worth1000.com">Worth1000</a> team that has previously built a popular site based around community interaction with events like Photoshop contests.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_images_1100.jpg" title="Aviary Images"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_images.jpg" alt="Aviary Images"></a></div>
<p>Since each application is created in Adobe Flex, users will be able to download applications and use them locally through the Adobe AIR platform.</p>
<h4>Aviary Phoenix</h4>
<p>Phoenix is Aviary&#8217;s flagship image editing application. At first glance it&#8217;s not too far away from a simple Photoshop-like editor. Menus are where you would expect them to be and tools are familiar. Beyond that, Aviary&#8217;s products shouldn&#8217;t be compared to Adobe&#8217;s offerings. They are more of a creative outlet than just a tool. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_loading_1200.jpg" title="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_loading.jpg" alt="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_loaded_1200.jpg" title="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_loaded.jpg" alt="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"/></a></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_f40_1279.jpg" title="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/aviary_phoenix_f40.jpg" alt="Aviary Phoenix Image Editor"/></a></div>
<p>One common concern when using web-based applications deals with speed and performance. How much slower is the application when uploading files and performing actions? With Aviary Phoenix, that&#8217;s a valid concern and for the most part actions like adjusting levels, brightness, hues and filters were instantaneous on the 10MP image I uploaded. But here&#8217;s the catch - it seems like Phoenix resized the photo to 1600px by 1071px from its original 3872px by 2592px.</p>
<p>I had a few other nitpicks with Phoenix, such as the filters being overly simplified. For example, when I run a sharpen filter I like adjusting the pixel size and amount. With Phoenix it runs a basic setting that I find too powerful for the images I work with. I also had an issue with auto levels in Phoenix. It doesn&#8217;t seem to do much of anything when compared to running auto levels on the same images in Photoshop CS3.</p>
<p>Also, I found working with the rectangular selection tool to be irksome. I&#8217;m used to using the arrow keys to fine-tune my selection. That didn&#8217;t work so I resorted to using the transformation tool to move my selection but that just ended up moving the selected image portion itself. Then I went back to just trying the selection tool again and using my mouse instead of arrow keys. It worked. My issue arose from the lack of a hover state displaying a move icon over the selection. I didn&#8217;t know I could click and move the selection. Small usability tweaks like that would greatly improve various pieces of Phoenix.</p>
<p>Finally, I would love for Phoenix to have a standalone cropping tool rather than relying on people to use the selection tool first. </p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>At the moment, Phoenix seems better suited for basic actions like cropping, levels adjustments and resizing smaller images meant for web publishing. This is to be expected when compared to other products in the space, such as <a href="http://www.picnik.com/" title="Picnik">Picnik</a> and <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/" title="Photoshop Express">Photoshop Express</a>, which all have similar proficiencies. However, that&#8217;s not to say that this can&#8217;t be changed by the time Phoenix comes out of beta.</p>
<p>Overall, as a proponent of cloud computing I applaud any effort to create interesting web-based tools and this seems to be the epitome of <a href="http://a.viary.com/" title="Aviary">Aviary&#8217;s suite of applications</a>. <strong>Let me know what you think of Aviary in a comment and I&#8217;ll send you a beta invitation (until I run out).</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/16/pictures-how-i-got-my-apple-iphone-3g">iPhone 3G ever since I waited in line and bought one</a> a bit over two weeks ago. The big question people ask me is if it&#8217;s worth the $199 USD and increase in monthly service fees. It is, but only slightly. For the most part, the 2.0 firmware provided most of the improvements, like the App Store, and that&#8217;s completely free for first generation iPhone users.  Rather than writing a full iPhone 3G review which you&#8217;ve probably already read elsewhere online, I&#8217;ll just post my thoughts on the more important points.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iphone3g_sideways_1024.jpg" title="Apple iPhone 3G"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iphone3g_sideways.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 3G"/></a></div>
<h4>Specs</h4>
<p>Hardware-wise, there are only a handful of real upgrades. Obviously, faster 3G connectivity ranks high on this list if you live in a city with good coverage. 3G reception in Atlanta has been great for me, but in Houston and Austin it is definitely spotty. In regards to the 3G vs EDGE argument, 3G is noticeably faster. I remember loading the New York Times homepage on my first generation iPhone over EDGE in 73 seconds. With 3G, that load time went down to <strong>17 seconds</strong> (with 1 reception bar no less).</p>
<p><img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/yelp_iphone3g.jpg" alt="iPhone 3G Yelp Application"/>GPS is a very nice addition, especially with the prevalence of location-aware applications like Vicinity, Yelp, UrbanSpoon and many others. However, the built-in Maps application doesn&#8217;t have the ability to use it as a turn by turn navigation tool. You can use your current location as a starting point but it does not use it after you begin (just displays it). Also, don&#8217;t plan on using the GPS on any camping trips - the Maps application depends on an Internet connection to download the actual map tiles so if you don&#8217;t have any reception, the GPS is useless.</p>
<p><img align="right" style="padding-left:5px;" src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/gps_iphone3g.jpg" alt="iPhone 3G GPS Maps Application"/>That being said, there is still the cool factor of being able to see your location move on the map as you&#8217;re driving. Until someone comes out with a navigation application and I can mount the iPhone 3G to my windshield, I just follow my blue dot until I reach my destination.</p>
<p>Other upgrades include the much louder speaker and tweaked case. You can actually hear the ringer when people call you and speaker phone is noticeably louder as well. I can&#8217;t begin to explain how many calls I have missed because I was in a moderately noisy environment and never heard the first generation iPhone ring. The new iPhone is a bit lighter at the expense of a cheaper-feeling rear case with tapered edges to create the illusion of a thinner phone. In addition, the headphones jack is no longer recessed so it can be used with the earbuds of your choice without resorting to an unsightly adapter.</p>
<h4>Complaints</h4>
<p>The battery life is excruciatingly horrible. I woke up at 2pm today, unplugged my iPhone from the charger, went about my day, came home at 2am and received a 10% battery warning. It should come with a car charger for free.</p>
<h4>App Store</h4>
<p><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/appstore_iphone3g.jpg" alt="iPhone App Store" align="right" style="padding-left:5px;"/>The real upgrade is the 2.0 firmware, which brings  the App Store and greatly enhances the functionality of the iPhone. While there are no lack of <a href="http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/93E914B5-89ED-4D46-8EFD-9AACC6BAE818.html">App Store critics</a>, I am quite content with it. There are hundreds of applications to satisfy almost any need you can think of, and for the not-so-legal needs, you can always jailbreak your iPhone and do things <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398961/get-your-computer-online-using-your-iphones-data-connection">like share your Internet connection with your laptop</a> and so on. There are apps to make your iPhone a notetaking powerhouse, keep track of your finances, find places to eat, listen to Pandora, remote control your iTunes library (my fave), kill time with games and more. I really can&#8217;t help but keep stating how pleased I am with the App Store. Using it for the first time felt something like finding a $100 bill in the jeans you&#8217;ve been wearing all day.</p>
<p>If I had to nitpick on one aspect of the App Store, it would have to be app upgrading process. Whenever I try to upgrade an application, it fails and tells me to sync with iTunes.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>After using the iPhone 3G for a few weeks, it hasn&#8217;t changed my life but it has made some things easier. I don&#8217;t have to worry about updating my playlists with new music before heading out the door. I can just fire up the Pandora application and walk to class. When I get back to my apartment, I can open up the Apple Remote application and play music in my living room and pretend I have a high-end <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/05/07/review-sonos-digital-music-system">Sonos music system</a>. As you might notice, that&#8217;s mostly just software though. </p>
<p>The iPhone 3G might be for you if you use your phone for more than just a bit of web browsing and email checking. The 3G connectivity is the most useful hardware upgrade while GPS is just a yet-to-be-fully-realized-until-navigation-apps-are-released luxury. The iPhone 3G receives <strong>7 out of 10 Stammys</strong>.</p>
<p>If you plan on picking yours up anytime soon, you&#8217;ll probably still be subject to lines. I just snapped this at the Houston Galleria today:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/2735854021/" title="iPhone 3G line at Houston Galleria by Paul Stamatiou, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3001/2735854021_02e8de1c3f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="iPhone 3G line at Houston Galleria" /></a></p>
<p>Will you be upgrading? What are your favorite App Store apps? So far I&#8217;m digging Pandora, Things, Twinkle and Texas Hold&#8217;em.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the next week, I will be completely unwired as I embark on a camping trip with several friends (an electrical engineering student and three pre-law students) in the Middle of No Where, Texas (about 2-3 hours from Austin). According to AT&#038;T&#8217;s coverage map, I won&#8217;t have much of a cell signal and paired with the iPhone 3G&#8217;s horrid battery life, I won&#8217;t be getting much use out of it. As far as geeky survival tools are concerned, I&#8217;m bringing the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/11/30/review-wicked-lasers-elite-150">150mW green laser</a> I reviewed last year, a 12 gauge flare gun, a <a href="http://www.solio.com/charger/">Solio solar charger</a>, 5 or 6 LED flashlights, a propane-fueled lantern and white gasoline for starting a campfire in case we find an area not under a burn ban.</p>
<p>Should we ever get stranded on a day-long hike or rafting excursion (or more likely, encounter mountain lions), the charger would be used to power <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/16/pictures-how-i-got-my-apple-iphone-3g">my iPhone</a> to publish/Twitter GPS coordinates if there is a cell signal present. The laser could be used as a beacon for alerting rescuers (note: not pointed at aircraft, which is highly illegal in the U.S.) to our position at night, with the flare gun reserved for daytime use. Of course, I&#8217;m just playing out unlikely scenarios in my head. We&#8217;ll have plenty of water, food and be sufficiently distanced from any sort of stress-inducing, information-overload-producing piece of technology.. real vacation.</p>
<p><strong>What is the longest you have been completely without an Internet connection?</strong> The last I can remember was in 2004 when I was at my uncle&#8217;s place Greece, couldn&#8217;t get dial-up to work on my laptop and only found an Internet café every 3 or 4 days.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking - <em>another lounge chair review</em>? Not too long ago I purchased a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/12/sumo-omni-i-dub-thee-bloggers-chair" title="Sumo Omni I Dub Thee Blogger's Chair">Sumo Omni and declared it</a> to be the ultimate blogger&#8217;s chair for its ability to conform to variety of comfortable computer-friendly positions. Not much has changed with Sumo as I feel the same way about their largest offering, the 6ft by 4ft SumoSac. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_1200.jpg" title="SumoSac"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac.jpg" alt="SumoSac"/></a></div>
<p>For full disclosure, Sumo contacted me after my Omni review (I purchased that one myself) and asked if I would like to take the SumoSac for a spin. As my living room was still relatively bare, I could not decline the offer.  However, before I was even able to get the SumoSac into my apartment I had quite a frustrating shipping experience. Sumo was supposed to have shipped the Sac vacuumed or packed in such a way that I would not see this when going to pick it up:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_shipping.jpg" alt="SumoSac Shipping Nightmare"/></div>
<p>As you can see, they did a poor job packaging the SumoSac and it had expanded and burst the box open during transit. By the time I had transported it to my residence, it had expanded to three times that size and made it unruly enough that I had to use the freight elevator.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_filling_1200.jpg" title="SumoSac Filling"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_filling.jpg" alt="SumoSac Filling"/></a></div>
<p>Compared to the Omni, the Sac is easy to work with since you don&#8217;t need to prop it against anything to create a supportive position. This also means that you will be absorbed inside the Sac and not want to move unless nature calls.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_omni_1200.jpg" title="Sumo Sac and Sumo Omni"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_omni.jpg" alt="Sumo Sac and Sumo Omni"></a></div>
<p>As far as first impressions were concerned, I actually thought it was going to be bigger. While it appears to be not much smaller than my couch, the Sac is still a one person lounger, two max if you&#8217;re up for cuddling. </p>
<h4>Laptop Performance</h4>
<p>Now for the best part of the SumoSac: it is large enough for you to rest your laptop on its own surface and even form a raised area for it. This beats toasting your legs or moving your laptop whenever you get up. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_theater_1200.jpg" title="SumoSac"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sumosac_theater.jpg" alt="SumoSac"/></a></div>
<p>Unlike bean bag chairs and related loungers though, the Sac is filled with &#8220;shredded furniture grade urethane foam&#8221; so it hopefully won&#8217;t lose its volume over time. The only downside is that after you sit on it and get up there&#8217;s an impression left, so if you want to create a different position you&#8217;ll have to kick it around to reset it back to an unformed shape.</p>
<h4>Worth it?</h4>
<p>At <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/sumosacG.php">$399 USD, the largest SumoSac</a> is expensive and definitely more along the lines of a luxury item aimed at the young crowd. I&#8217;m not sure how well that works out. Not putting price into consideration, the SumoSac is comfortable enough to have earned a seat in front of my TV. But for that much money they couldn&#8217;t engineer a way to put a cup holder in it? Tsk tsk. The SumoSac receives <strong>6 out of 10 Stammys</strong>.</p>
<p>SumoSac or [$400 gadget of your choice]?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been a fan of bluetooth earpieces. I always thought it was kind of weird to see people walking along and seemingly talking to themselves, or emitting a bright blue pulse from a LED on their earpiece. After hearing about the <a href="http://us.jawbone.com/">Aliph Jawbone 2 bluetooth earpiece</a> all too much, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. If you live in California, chances are you will need to pick up a hands-free earpiece sooner or later to comply with the newest driving regulation so keep reading.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_stand_1024.jpg" title="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_stand.jpg" alt="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece"/></a></div>
<h4>Why so popular?</h4>
<p>First off, why is the Jawbone so popular anyway and why isn&#8217;t this the first time you&#8217;ve heard of it? Aliph&#8217;s original Jawbone was marketed as a stylish earpiece with remarkable call quality due to signal processing developed for DARPA that reduced background noise.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the Jawbone because each earpiece has a &#8220;Voice Activity Sensor&#8221; that rests on your cheek and detects if you are talking so it can filter out background noise accordingly. Now with the Jawbone 2, Aliph has taken two years of customer feedback and improved call quality and made it half the size. As you might imagine, the Jawbone 2 is at the high-end of the cell phone accessories scale and retails for $129 USD.</p>
<h4>Unboxing</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_charger_1024.jpg" title="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_charger.jpg" alt="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece"/></a></div>
<p>There&#8217;s not much in the Jawbone 2 box other than a charger, the earpiece itself and a few earbuds and loops to accommodate different users. The packaging is almost like the new iPods in their small plastic cases. After taking the earpiece out, Aliph recommends charging it for 50 minutes. The charger is travel-sized and the cable can be disconnected and plugged into a USB port for an alternative method of charging. The end of the cable that attaches to the Jawbone 2 is magnetic a la MagSafe so there&#8217;s no fidgeting with a latch as is often the case with other bluetooth earpieces.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_charging_1024.jpg" title="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece Charging"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_charging.jpg" alt="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece Charging"/></a></div>
<h4>Fitting</h4>
<p>Getting the Jawbone 2 to fit properly on my ear was a bit challenging. I tried various earbuds and flexed the earhook several times to get it to stay put but it never felt comfortable. I would prefer some sort of in-ear earbud attachment, although I have a feeling that Aliph designed the Jawbone like this so that some external sounds are audible for safety purposes. It would be better if the earhooks provided were more flexible. They are the type that require a lot of force and even still tend to go back to their original shape.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_earpieces_1024.jpg" title="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece Add-ons"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_earpieces.jpg" alt="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece Add-ons"/></a></div>
<p>If the earbud alone fits you perfectly you can take off the earhook altogether and just wear the Jawbone 2 by itself. </p>
<h4>Pairing</h4>
<p>Setting up the Jawbone 2 with <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/07/16/pictures-how-i-got-my-apple-iphone-3g" title="Pictures: How I Got My Apple iPhone 3G">my iPhone 3G</a> was a trival process that involved turning on bluetooth, holding down the two buttons on the Jawbone 2 to enable discoverable mode and pairing it with the iPhone. The iPhone recognized it and when making calls gives the option of what audio source/output to use.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_iphone_screens_962.jpg" title="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece iPhone Settings"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_iphone_screens.jpg" alt="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece iPhone Settings"/></a></div>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p>There are two concealed buttons on the Jawbone 2. One takes care of basic necessities like picking up calls and hanging up on calls as well as turning the Jawbone on and off while the other controls volume and &#8220;Noise Assassin.&#8221; However, each button is multi-function and gives the user considerable control with minimal interaction - ideally. For me pushing the buttons on the earpiece often moved the earpiece, making me waste time putting it back in that perfect spot.</p>
<p>For example, tapping the rear button three times redials the last call while tapping it during a call will go through volume presets on your phone (unfortunately there is no direct control over volume on the Jawbone).</p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>When it comes to call quality, the Jawbone 2 is no slouch. On my end I could hear people clearly with little static. Volume is adequate but it begins to crackle on the highest setting. On the other end of the call, people told me they could hear me well (good for my echo-y wood floored apartment) but they often asked if I was on speaker phone - 8 out of 13 people to be exact. I found myself speaking up and repeating myself occasionally but this seems to be a trend across most earpieces. Interpret that however you like.</p>
<p>For using the Jawbone 2 for a week, I only had one situation where the Jawbone 2 got disconnected from the iPhone for whatever reason while a call was still active.</p>
<p>I was able to safely wander 15 feet away from my phone with the Jawbone 2 before static was introduced. At about 30 feet the Jawbone 2 lost a connection with the phone. That seems to be right on par for bluetooth and is more than adequate for normal use.</p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_iphone_sill_1024.jpg" title="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece with Apple iPhone 3G"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jawbone_iphone_sill.jpg" alt="Jawbone Bluetooth Earpiece with Apple iPhone 3G"/></a></div>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say the Jawbone 2 has changed my life but it is by and far a capable bluetooth earpiece. I keep it in my car now for picking up calls when driving but other than that I still use my phone normally. I don&#8217;t enjoy spending a minute or two each time I put on the earpiece to get it to fit properly. It never really felt at home in my ear. The Aliph Jawbone 2 receives <strong>7.5 out of 10 Stammys</strong>. It would receive a 9 out of 10 with easier to use buttons and a more comfortable fit.</p>
<p>Do you use a bluetooth headset with your mobile phone?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the name implies, Apple&#8217;s MacBook Air laptop is not lighter than Air nor does it float on Air or any such nonsense. It is actually quite prone to falling and the minimalist nature of the laptop does not protect internal components as do the larger MacBooks. I accidentally put this theory to the test when I dropped my MacBook Air two feet onto a hard surface. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/2701164059/" title=";-/ by Paul Stamatiou, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3181/2701164059_bd3e18bda8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt=";-/" /></a></div>
<p>The result was a deadly blow to one of the corners near the hinge, placing undue stress upon the screen and cracking it. Fortunately, the hard drive and everything else inside the Air seem to be fine. Unfortunately this accidental damage is not covered by Apple warranty. For the time being I will be using it solely connected to my external display until I figure out what to do. </p>
<p>What would you do, other than not accidentally drop it?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past three weeks I have been toting around a Nikon D300 camera, courtesy of <a href="http://jratlee.com/" rel="no follow">John Ratcliffe-Lee</a> and his team at the MWW Group. While my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/05/14/an-ode-to-dslr-cameras" title="An Ode to DSLR Cameras">Nikon D80 is considered an entry-level DSLR camera</a>, the D300 is more along the lines of a mid-range offering, only bested by the full-frame Nikon D700 and the D3. That privilege doesn&#8217;t come cheap though; the current D300 kit I have, including an 18-200mm lens with image stabilization and an extended battery, runs close to a hefty $3,000 USD. I titled this post first impressions instead of review since there are way too many D300 features to cover for me to even come close to calling this a review.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_sumo_1024.jpg" title="The Nikon D300 Digital SLR (DSLR) Camera"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_sumo.jpg" alt="The Nikon D300 Digital SLR (DSLR) Camera"/></a></div>
<h4>Specifications</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_lens_1200.jpg" title="Nikon D300 Digital SLR Camera"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_lens.jpg" alt="Nikon D300 Digital SLR Camera"/></a></div>
<p>The D300 sports a self-cleaning sensor unit containing a 12.3 megapixel DX format (not full-frame) CMOS sensor, powerful Nikon &#8220;EXPEED&#8221; image processor and a high-resolution (noticeably much better than the D80) 3-inch display. However, I&#8217;m more interested in the D300&#8217;s amazing 51-point autofocus system and its &#8220;Active D-Lighting&#8221; feature. Everything about the D300 is quick, especially coming from a D80. It&#8217;s also quite a bit larger and heavier, quickly setting it apart from entry-level DSLR cameras.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_d80_739.jpg" title="Size Comparison: Nikon D300 and D80"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_d80.jpg" alt="Size Comparison: Nikon D300 and D80"/></a><br/><small>Size Comparison: Nikon D300 (with battery grip) vs Nikon D80</small></div>
<h4>Live View</h4>
<p>Unlike previous Nikon DSLR offerings, the D300 has a &#8220;LiveView&#8221; feature, making it much like a point and shoot camera. However, using LiveView is quite different than a point and shoot camera. Since DSLRs have a single lens, using LiveView involves lifting a mirror inside the camera. When the picture is taken, the mirror goes back down and the screen stops showing the image until after it has been saved. It is honestly quite a bulky process and I do not think many camera aficionados will be using it often.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_liveview_1100.jpg" title="Nikon D300 DSLR Camera supports Liveview"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_liveview.jpg" alt="Nikon D300 DSLR Camera supports Liveview"/></a></div>
<p>It does have the ability to let photographers digitally zoom in on the image, like an enhanced viewfinder, as it is being composed and then take the picture.</p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>As a casual photographer I don&#8217;t spend too much time tinkering with settings. Rather, I prefer to use smart features of the camera to capture a great picture. With the D300 those features are &#8220;Active D-Lighting&#8221; (commonly referred to as Adaptive Dynamic Range) and Vibration Reduction built into the 18-200mm lens. First off, ADR is a real-time image processing system unlike regular D-Lighting, which is a post-processing feature to adjust highlights, colors, shadows and contrast. With ADR enabled, the D300 prevents images getting washed out from overexposure and it works pretty well; much better than taking a photo without it and then trying to correct the picture with D-Lighting.</p>
<p>Combine Active D-Lighting with the D300&#8217;s better color saturation and it&#8217;s a great camera for the gadget-crazed. On the subject of color saturation, with &#8220;Picture Control&#8221; set to Vivid and then Sharpening, Hue and Saturation dialed up a few notches, you can breathe new life into pictures and it saves the hassle of increasing saturation in Photoshop for a livelier picture.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_vert_800.jpg" title="Nikon D300 DSLR Camera with 18-200mm VR Lens"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_vert.jpg" alt="Nikon D300 DSLR Camera with 18-200mm VR Lens"/></a></div>
<p>Vibration Reduction is actually a feature provided by a mechanism in the lens which moves the internal optics to account for random camera shaking and lens movement, making it ideal for hand-held photography. The effects are particularly noticeable in low light situations. While I think the effects of VR are at least noticeable, I have heard photographers say they can shoot almost entirely without a tripod thanks to their VR lenses. I&#8217;d at least want to have a monopod handy for some stability.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_top_1200.jpg" title="Nikon D300 Mode Screen"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nikond300_top.jpg" alt="Nikon D300 Mode Screen"/></a></div>
<p>The 51-point autofocus system on the D300 is the next most useful aspect of the camera. Compare this to the 11-point autofocus system on the D80. The benefit of having so many extra autofocus points is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about how your photo is composed - the D300 will just select the most appropriate of all the points and focus there. It makes the photo composition and capturing process much quicker. I remember when I was at the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/01/14/live-from-the-detroit-auto-show" title="Live from the Detroit Auto Show">Detroit Auto Show in January with a Nikon D40x</a> that only had 3 autofocus points. I constantly had to recompose the photo to ensure proper focus, or manually focus and pray for a sharp image. </p>
<p>There is a slight downside when using the AF mode commonly referred to as &#8220;big white rectangle&#8221; (named after the icon on the AF mode selector). It takes a bit longer for the D300 to autofocus in this mode as I&#8217;m guessing the processor can&#8217;t go through all of the data produced by the 51 points fast enough to select the right ones. But I&#8217;m talking only barely noticeable.</p>
<p>As for battery life, I took the Nikon D300 with me to Rome for a week with the extended battery grip and only consumed one of the batteries and ran through 700 shots. I never even had to use my charger. </p>
<p>On the subject of nitpicks, Nikon claims that the D300 has much better noise reduction in images yet low-lighting pictures I have taken were still considerably grainy. Of course, the camera settings and the lens used are both factors in picture quality.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<div class="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="334" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=55430" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"><param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=579938fc26&amp;photo_id=2690171347&amp;show_info_box=true"></param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=55430"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=55430" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=579938fc26&amp;photo_id=2690171347&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true" height="334" width="500"></embed></object></div>
<p>The D300 is a high-performance prosumer camera and seems to be as good as you can get before the jump to a full-frame sensor. It focuses quickly, shoots quickly and can adjust &#8220;D-Lighting&#8221; on the fly well. However for that much money, I think it is worth it to invest in a quality set of lenses, such as those featuring VR, and get a cheaper body (keep your eye on the upcoming D90). That way you&#8217;ll be able to afford replacing the obsolete body every 3 years. That&#8217;s not to say that the D300 isn&#8217;t a great camera though. If you want to read a real D300 review from a real photographer, check out <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond300/">Phil Askey&#8217;s review</a> or <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d300.htm">Ken Rockwell&#8217;s review</a>.</p>
<p>How would you spend $3,000 on camera equipment?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier last week I had the chance to attend and speak at a private TTI/Vanguard conference entitled Generation Techs. Due to the nature of the conference I am not allowed to say who was in attendance but I hope to share some of the more interesting things discussed. As I told the conference organizers, it was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had. The people in attendance were accomplished and influential visionaries within their fields. You can get a good sense for the conference just by reading about from the <a href="http://ttivanguard.com/board/index.html">TTI/Vanguard advisory board</a>. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ttivanguard_gentechs.jpg" alt="TTI/Vanguard Generation Techs Conference in Rome, Italy"/></div>
<h4>My Talk</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ttivanguard_treviftn_paul_1024.jpg" title="Paul Stamatiou at Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ttivanguard_treviftn_paul.jpg" alt="Paul Stamatiou at Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy"/></a></div>
<p>The conference was about the digital gap between generations and the emergence of so-called millennials or digital natives. My talk delved into my predictions for the near future, a day in the life of how I use technology, and a <a href="http://skribit.com">Skribit</a> demo to show how it establishes a feedback loop amongst site authors and readers that digital natives have become so accustomed to.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conclusions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Digital natives have begun embracing web-based services.</li>
<li>They care about conversation and collaboration.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, information overload comes with the territory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Predictions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Everything will be in the <strong>cloud</strong>. Local storage will only be for caching.</li>
<li><strong>Users will be able to fully control</strong> and maintain their identity, data and connections across websites they use daily. Keep an eye out for OpenID, Data Portability and social graph portability efforts.</li>
<li>Advances in technologies like collaborative filtering, SVD and <strong>natural language processing</strong> will help users cut through the noise and eliminate information overload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Web 3.0 is supposedly all about the so-called semantic web and machines being able to communicate with machines. This process involves adding meta data into existing structures to identify what exactly each piece of information is, but I think we need the ability for machines to understand humans. In 5-10 years, natural language processing will be able to coherently comprehend human language and its use. Imagine being able to feed a piece of NLP software information about you - from your Twitter archives to your blog posts - and just &#8220;understand&#8221; who you are, like a piece of artificial intelligence formed around your tastes and opinions. Then that could be used to cut down information overload by applying it as post-processing. Imagine having a system know all of your previous interactions with anyone online and being able to prioritize your emails for you, or even act on your behalf. But of course, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Day in the Life of a Digital Native</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wake up to iPhone alarm, check email on iPhone, go back to sleep.</li>
<li>Wake up again, roll over to my computer, play music from Pandora or TheSixtyOne</li>
<li>Check my Google Apps email account. Don&#8217;t worry about organizing emails, just archive and search later.</li>
<li>Browse headlines and news items recommended by friends with Feedly</li>
<li>Check Twitter replies. Twitter shows the power of having many weak connections. I have used it to sell things, seek legal advice from real lawyers, receive answers to technical questions and so on.</li>
<li>Check Summize (now Twitter Search) results for Skribit. Summize is great for online brand management.</li>
<li>Check user feedback and issues at GetSatisfaction.com - crowd-sourced tech support</li>
<li>Use Campfire to collaborate on Skribit development. Once again, everything is logged so we can work at different times, see what everyone is working on and search for past conversations.</li>
<li>Collaborate on class notes with classmates with Google Docs</li>
<li>Consume high-quality media at Hulu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ttivanguard_colosseum_pstam_1024.jpg" title="Paul Stamatiou at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ttivanguard_colosseum_pstam.jpg" alt="Paul Stamatiou at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy"/></a></div>
<p>In no particular order, here are some of the focuses of the conference that I picked up on or thought were interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital natives have a different sense of privacy and have no problem putting private information on their social network profiles or blogs. Young people have a culture of sharing and peer collaboration. This is one of the reasons I listed for the growth of Twitter among the younger crowd - by putting their relatively private information online, users can find similar people online and establish online connections.</li>
<li>Many young people believe that the quantity of text on a web page correlates with the quality of the information.</li>
<li>Data is for interaction, not merely for consumption.</li>
<li>Amateur vs Professional -  Amateurs approach their undertakings with passion and can sometimes outperform professionals. Rise of the amateur with the internet and the proliferation of avenues for content distribution. &#8220;Amateurs built Noah’s ark, but professionals built the Titanic.&#8221;</li>
<li>Longitudinal observation indicates that an individual’s preferred work style evolves, dictated by the demands of the job. That is, it has been predicted that today’s 23-year-olds will have the habits of today’s 65-year-olds by the time they reach 65 themselves. I&#8217;m not sure I agree with this one but it&#8217;s interesting nonetheless.</li>
<li>Human–machine interfaces are not intuitive or nonintuitive; they are either familiar or unfamiliar, and a measure of familiarity is the amount of attention they require of the user.</li>
<li>Yet-to-be-released Firefox functionality showed how users could type in phrases in plain English and the browser would carry out certain functions.. moving towards natural language processing.</li>
<li><strong>Everything that can be socially powered will be.</strong></li>
<li>Groups of children, given appropriate digital resources, can school themselves on their own. The <a href="http://hole-in-the-wall.com/">Hole-in-the-wall PC project</a> confirmed this.</li>
<li>Mobile connections (GPRS and 3G) are huge in Africa as they are generally faster than landline Internet connections. This might change in 2009 when an undersea cable for Internet connectivity makes its way to Africa.</li>
<li>Human-to-computer input mechanisms have largely been limited to conscious commands via voice and hands (via keyboard, mouse, touchpad, touchscreen, trackball, etc.); <a href="http://emotiv.com">Emotiv</a> introduces next-gen input directly from the brain.</li>
<li>There was a concern that while digital natives have comfort and familiarity with a wide range of technologies and the concept of a technology-mediated life, they do not use their everyday tools deeply nor do they apply mature reasoning to the use of those tools. </li>
<li>Large enterprises anticipate an upcoming shortfall in skilled workers at all levels as baby boomers enter retirement in the coming years. </li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking a note from <a href="http://hulu.com">Hulu</a>, CBS <a href="http://www.cbs.com/hd/" title="CBS HD">launched an HD video player</a> not too long ago. Their HD video gallery sports streamed, ad-supported clips and full episodes from their primetime shows. The site is plastered with Intel ads and unlike Hulu, videos are not embeddable.  </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/cbs_hd_bbt_1024.jpg" title="CBS HD Video Player"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/cbs_hd_bbt.jpg" alt="CBS HD Video Player"/></a></div>
<p>CBS began testing <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/27/cbs-testing-high-def-streaming/" title="CBS Testing High Def Streaming">their HD video streaming back in March</a>, when they claimed they would be offering video streaming in 720p and 1080p in addition to the current 480p video. Unfortunately it does not seem like their claims have become a reality just yet. Then again, does anything higher than 480p have its place on the typical consumers&#8217; computer such as an ordinary laptop with a moderate broadband connection?</p>
<p>Do you take advantage of video streaming <a href="http://www.cbs.com/hd/" title="CBS HD">sites like this</a> and Hulu? Or do you prefer acquiring the episodes you want in higher quality? While I used to be a big fan of such services, ever since I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/06/11/going-hd-part-1">got an HDTV</a> I either watch shows when they are on or find them in HD later and feed them to my HTPC.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I have recovered from my jet lag, I have been catching up on news, the biggest story being the iPhone 3G launch that I missed. Well, not entirely - there were <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pauls/2664224629/">quite a few stores</a> in Rome that had the new iPhone. Today I began standing in line for an iPhone 3G at the Apple Store at 7am. Five hours later I had a shiny new black 8GB iPhone 3G.  This was my first experience of waiting more than a few hours to buy anything so I decided to catalog my experience with (iPhone) pictures.</p>
<h4>Entering Lenox Mall at 7am</h4>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_mallearly.jpg" alt="Lenox Mall at 7am on July 16th 2008"/></div>
<h4>You can&#8217;t sit on the floor.</h4>
<p>The security guard informs us we are not allowed to sit on the floor. He is flooded with questions. Once he leaves, everyone sat back down again. He came back a few times to tell us the same thing.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_guard.jpg" alt="The security guard informs us we cannot sit on the floor"/></div>
<h4>No problem..</h4>
<p>Wise line-waiters moved several couches from other parts of the mall.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_couch.jpg" alt="Moving the couch"/></div>
<h4>The line grows</h4>
<p>The line grows at a rate of one or two people every 5 minutes. People keep busy with everything from crossword puzzles, playing on their iPhone, listening to music or chatting up with other line-waiters about the iPhone 3G.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_linegrows.jpg" alt="The line starts growing as 7:30am rolls around"/></div>
<h4>Opening</h4>
<p>The doors are about to open at 9am. Little did I know it would take another 3 hours to get my iPhone 3G.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_opening.jpg" alt="The doors are about to open"/></div>
<h4>Critical Mass</h4>
<p>By 10am the line had grown to 150 inhabitants and wrapped around the atrium. At this point only about 4 people had received their iPhones. It was done one at a time and seemed to take 20 minutes per person. Around this time Apple employees went through the line and instructed us to dial 611 to find out if our account was eligible for the iPhone 3G and at the subsidized price. A classmate in line with me was disappointed to discover that he would not be able to pickup an iPhone 3G as he was not the primary account holder.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_linewrap.jpg" alt="The line approaches 150 people and wraps around"/></div>
<h4>Are you iReady?</h4>
<p>Apple hands out a flier detailing information we need to provide to make things quicker.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_iready.jpg" alt="Apple hands out a flier to ensure we are ready for the iPhone 3G. It includes AT&#038;T plan info."/></div>
<h4>Refreshments</h4>
<p>Apple hands out water bottles.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_water.jpg" alt="Apple hands out water bottles to line-waiters."/></div>
<h4>My time has come</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s my turn to enter.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_myturn.jpg" alt="I'm next!"/></div>
<h4>Activation</h4>
<p>After I walked in, I told the Apple employee I wanted the 8GB iPhone 3G. He went away to the backroom and came back. After telling him I wanted the 200 SMS text messages plan and was fine with the additional charges and terms, he charged my debit card and instructed me to unbox my iPhone 3G. Activation was as simple as plugging in the iPhone into a display computer and opening iTunes. The AT&#038;T plan upgrade was all done on the Apple employee&#8217;s handheld.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone3g_unbox.jpg" alt="Unboxing the iPhone 3G to begin activation"/></div>
<h4>Done!</h4>
<p>Famished, I headed to an eatery and let iTunes backup my old iPhone. The backup and restore process took an unreasonably long amount of time.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone_backup.jpg" alt="Backing up my old iPhone."/></div>
<h4>iPhone 3G Thoughts?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ll make another post about my iPhone 3G thoughts but overall I think it has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/ptech/07/15/iphone.review/index.html">successfully lived up to the hype</a>. The App Store is a huge step for making the iPhone a versatile platform. I&#8217;m most interested in location-aware applications. Similar to the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/05/25/review-dash-express-gps" title="Review: Dash Express GPS">Dash Express</a>, I just want to get in my car, or in this case whip out my iPhone 3G, and find a place to eat, look up movie times and get directions, et cetera.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=20943&#038;ch=specialsections&#038;sc=futurebiz&#038;pg=1">Many people have predicted</a> what the future of the Internet holds. To each his own comes to mind as there are many different takes on what that future will be like. For some that future shows a vastly improved mobile web or the proliferation of open standards while to others the  future places high value on security as web-based services replace desktop applications. Of course there is the canonical &#8220;web 3.0 is the semantic web&#8221; approach as well. I have always sided with Alan Kay&#8217;s stance of &#8220;the best way to predict the future is to invent it.&#8221; However, I am often asked what I think the future of the web holds, so here is my answer.</p>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>Take a look around at the current state of the web. Everything is about feeds and information overload. An entire subset of the technology industry is devoted to creating feeds of feeds (Friendfeed, Socialthing and their competitors come to mind). Information overload is currently the single largest issue facing webizens. How many articles about how to get things done and managing your email inbox have you come across online?</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/information_overload_hydrant.jpg" alt="Information Overload Fire Hydrant"/><br/><small><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/will-lion/2595497078/">Photo Credit: Will Lion</a></small></div>
<h4>The Future</h4>
<p>While I believe there are many aspects to the future of the web, from relying on cloud data storage and web-based services to the rise of mobile location-aware services and advertising, the core of the future web will be about technologies that help users cut down on information overload. That is, taking large amounts of data and providing the user with information relevant to them and people that matter to them. Technologies in this space are collaborative filtering, singular value decompositions (think Netflix&#8217;s recommendations), artificial intelligence and latent semantic analysis.</p>
<p>I guess you could say this goes along with the &#8220;semantic web&#8221; concept of helping machines communicate with other machines and find relationships between data. In a fully realized form, these technologies will allow machines to learn and understand the tastes and preferences of the user and help filter through open data to provide the user with information they want, need and what they didn&#8217;t know they liked. Abiding by the long tail concept (although a <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/hbsp/hbr/articles/article.jsp?ml_action=get-article&#038;articleID=R0807H&#038;ml_issueid=BR0807&#038;ml_subscriber=true&#038;pageNumber=1&#038;_requestid=262525">study recently proved otherwise</a>), web users don&#8217;t necessarily like only the popular items, making it hard for current systems to adequately predict what the user wants or is looking for. I&#8217;m not just talking about reading feeds, but rather sifting through any open, linked data on the web, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>The future of the web will usher in open data. Businesses need to stop locking up their data. Just put it out there. Users will embrace it and it can only help with business. Publishing 2.0 put it well in <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/01/05/data-and-the-future-of-the-web/">an article about data</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The future of the web will be determined by companies that can overcome people challenges — to bring EVERYONE’S data online, and make it useful. And it won’t be about locking up people’s data, but instead helping them be smart about the free flow of their data.</p>
<p>It will be about networking that data, connecting it, to make a whole greater than the sum of the parts. That’s why web applications are so much more powerful than siloed desktop applications. That’s why the web itself is so powerful — it’s not just about collecting and distributing data. It’s about connecting data. And about connecting people.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>The future of the web is about efficiency. While the semantic web concept is about machines communicating with machines, we also really need a way for machines to understand humans. </p>
<p>When will we know when we have arrived at the future of the web? I like to think it&#8217;s when we reach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws" title="Arthur C Clark Laws of Prediction">Arthur C. Clark&#8217;s third law of prediction</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</strong></p>
<h4>Other Tech</h4>
<p>I only took on a single point of what I believe the future of the web will be about. I also feel that Data Portability, OpenID and the Social Graph will be interesting areas to watch. Users should not have to maintain multiple versions of their data, identity and connections on different websites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also pretty excited about where mobile location-aware services are headed. Wouldn&#8217;t you love to drive by a restaurant and immediately be notified of their $2 tacos deal? Okay, that&#8217;s not a strong example but you catch my drift. Fifty percent of Nokia phones will have GPS by 2010, 100 percent of Apple phones will have GPS by July 11th, 2008, and so on. The potential is there.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think the future of the web holds?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I love the cloud and try to keep all of my data in it. So when Google announced that they added PDF support a few weeks ago, I was listening. Last night I had the bright idea to move my treasured PDFs from my S3 account to Google Docs, where I would easily be able to read them with Google&#8217;s built-in preview and access the original files. Furthermore, I figured Google would have tied in PDF support with Google Gears, which allows users to put Google Docs to work even when offline.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google_docs_pdf_1222.jpg" title="Google Docs PDF Preview"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google_docs_pdf.jpg" alt="Google Docs PDF Preview"></a></div>
<p>PDF support in Google Docs seems to be lackluster at best. While I am fully aware they did not aim to include PDF editing for whatever reason, that&#8217;s fine with me - just being able to easily read PDFs is enough. Unfortunately, Google didn&#8217;t even get that part right.</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDF preview mode of Google Docs doesn&#8217;t include any sort of zoom functionality, so you&#8217;re left reading your PDF at an uncomfortable size.</li>
<li>Google Gears does not allow you to access PDFs in offline mode.</li>
<li>PDF search will tell you that there are 314 matches for &#8220;ruby&#8221; in your PDF but it will let you figure out on which pages those matches are. It would be nice to have a list view for search matches, like OS X Preview.</li>
<li>The preview mode stops caring after 100 pages and won&#8217;t display anything more.</li>
<li>Embedded links within PDFs are not clickable.</li>
<li>PDFs not viewable in the Google Docs mobile interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to use Google Docs as an online media hub to store and view various files online without having to download the original and tinker with it locally but that dream will have to wait.</p>
<p>Have you tried uploading a PDF to Google Docs? Do you use Google Docs regularly?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently launched <a href="http://startupwarrior.com" title="Startup Warrior">Startup Warrior</a> from former Georgia Tech classmate <a href="http://andrewcantino.com/">Andrew Cantino</a> utilizes the Crunchbase API to help visitors visually browse startups and view startup hubs. Since the launch, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/22/crunchbase-now-with-maps-advanced-search-jobs-and-milestones/">Crunchbase has added similar mapping functionality</a> but it&#8217;s up to you to decide which implementation is more effective. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/startup_warrior_843.jpg" title="Startup Warrior"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/startup_warrior.jpg" alt="Startup Warrior"></a></div>
<blockquote><p>StartupWarrior.com allows you to learn about startups in your city or neighborhood, both for job hunting and for networking with your peers. This website began as a personal project to identify geographic regions with the highest concentration of startups. The map helps to illuminate both the diversity of startups in hubs like Silicon Valley and London, and the growth of other startup communities in the US and abroad. </p></blockquote>
<p>The only feedback I have for Startup Warrior is that I would like to sort the startups in other ways than just location. For example, being able to show the 20 most profitable startups or the most recently created startups. It would also be neat to show startups by creation date and see startup hubs form as you move the date from say 2002 to 2008.</p>
<p>What do you think about Startup Warrior and other such startup tracking services?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.atllogos.com/">ATLlogos</a> is a related site that helps people find and learn about Atlanta-based early stage technology companies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I turn 22 years old. In the last year I have done a lot of things I&#8217;m happy about but I won&#8217;t dwell on them here. I&#8217;m looking to the future and especially this upcoming year. I only have 5 classes left at Georgia Tech until I receive my degree and I have already completed the harder Computer Science  half of my major. I&#8217;m taking 2 summer classes now so I will only have 3 classes in the Fall and will technically be listed as a part-time student.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take this time to talk about something I have been working on recently, my first real speaking gig. I was invited to speak at <a href="http://ttivanguard.com/conference/2008/generation.html">TTI/Vanguard&#8217;s Generation Techs conference</a> in Rome, Italy. I leave in about a week or so and my talk is called &#8220;Tales from a Digital Native.&#8221; I will be discussing how technology is closely integrated with my life and that of other so-called digital natives, and how I leverage web-based services and the power of the Internet to get work done. I&#8217;d tell you more but I&#8217;m still coming up with my slides. </p>
<p>I will be in Rome a few days after the conference so I will have some time to explore the city on my own. Nikon and the MWW Group lent me a Nikon D300 DSLR to tinker with so I&#8217;ll be coming back with some nice photos.</p>
<p>Also, I was recently contacted by NBC. They are looking to do a piece on Startup Weekend and want to interview me briefly about <a href="http://skribit.com">Skribit</a> to show what a Startup Weekend can lead to. I&#8217;ll let you know what happens with that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&#8217;ve been keeping busy. Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Oh and happy birthday to Facebook product designer <a href="http://robgoodlatte.com">Rob Goodlatte</a> who also celebrates his 22nd birthday today.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in May I did a bit of traveling and became somewhat paranoid about the Internet connections I found at various hotels. I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/05/16/how-to-surf-securely-with-ssh-tunnel">began using SSH tunnels to protect my web traffic</a> when using Internet connections I did not trust. While setting up an SSH tunnel is a fairly trivial matter for those familiar to the command line, it&#8217;s not the same for everyone. <a href="http://codesorcery.net/meerkat">Meerkat</a>, from the developer that brought you <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/07/11/pukka-got-me-bookmarking-again" title="Pukka Got Me Bookmarking Again">Pukka</a>, makes using and managing ssh tunnels easy. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/meerkat_about.jpg" alt="About Meerkat. SSH Tunnels Made Easy"/></div>
<h4>How To Use Meerkat</h4>
<p>Create an account with your server. You&#8217;ll need SSH access but you probably already have that.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/meerkat_add_account.jpg" alt="Meerkat - Add Account"/></div>
<p>Add an SSH tunnel. I created one with dynamic port forwarding and will use it for all my web traffic.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/meerkat_add_tunnel.jpg" alt="Meerkat - Add Tunnel"/></div>
<h4>OS/Browser Configuration</h4>
<p>Go to the main Meerkat window and ensure that there is a check in the box marked &#8220;Active.&#8221; The SSH tunnel should now be active, but your browser and OS need to know that it&#8217;s there so they can use it.</p>
<p>In OS X, head over to System Preferences &raquo; Network &raquo; Advanced &raquo; Proxies. Check the box next to SOCKS Proxy, type in &#8220;localhost&#8221; with port 8080 for the server and click OK, then Apply. Safari should now be utilizing the SSH tunnel.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/leopard_ssh_tunnel_pstam.jpg" alt="Meerkat - Configure Leopard and Safari"/></div>
<p>To get Firefox 3 to use the tunnel, go to Preferences &raquo; Advanced &raquo; Network &raquo; Settings and select the manual proxy configuration radio button. Enter in localhost and port 8080 for SOCKS Host.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/meerkat_firefox3_proxy.jpg" alt="Meerkat - Configure Firefox 3 Proxy"/></div>
<p>I recommend using Firefox 3 when browsing with an SSH tunnel since it uses remote DNS by default (<em>network.proxy.socks_remote_dns = true</em> in about:config). Basically, with a SOCKS 5 proxy Firefox can determine which side of the proxy handles DNS work. If done locally, people snooping around your network traffic can still see what domains you&#8217;re browsing, although they won&#8217;t see particular URLs. The remote DNS setting ensures that your trusted server takes care of all DNS lookups.</p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>You can test to see if the tunnel is working by visiting a site like <a href="http://whatismyip.com/" rel="nofollow">What Is My IP</a>. If the IP address listed is that of your server, you&#8217;re good to go. The only downside of SSH tunnels is the longer distance and inherit latency issues that your web traffic incurs. For example, my bandwidth more than halved when the SSH tunnel was active. That&#8217;s the price of security though.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pstam_mtemple.png" alt="Media Temple ISP"/></div>
<h4>Thoughts on Meerkat</h4>
<p><a href="http://codesorcery.net/meerkat">Meerkat</a> is unobtrusive (I prefer disabling the dock icon and just have a menubar icon) and makes using SSH tunnels easy. You don&#8217;t have to fire up a command line or write a script to automatically create a tunnel when you want to use it. You only need to turn on Meerkat. Whether that functionality is worth the $20 license cost is up to you.</p>
<p>Other Meerkat features I haven&#8217;t yet tinkered with include Growl notifications, Bonjour service advertising (make a tunnel and let other networked Macs access it over Bonjour) and application triggering (have Meerkat open whatever app you like when an SSH tunnel is created).</p>
<p>Do you browse on untrusted networks from time to time and use SSH tunnels to add in security? Would you use Meerkat?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just got back from the midnight showing of Disney/Pixar&#8217;s latest flick, Wall•E. I&#8217;m here to recommend that you see it at your earliest convenience. I am no movie critic but I can easily tell you it was great and not more than a few minutes passed between theater-wide laughter (Rotten Tomatoes <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/">rates it at 98%</a>). If you have a Mac or have worked with them, you&#8217;ll quickly notice a nice homage to Apple. I don&#8217;t want to spoil it, but it&#8217;s quite obvious and the audience will start clapping immediately.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wall-e_1280.jpg" title="Wall-E"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wall-e.jpg" alt="Wall-E"/></a></div>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen a midnight showing before, it is quite a different experience and brings out the more dedicated (and geeky) fans. Naturally, I ran into a more than a few classmates while waiting in line tonight. </p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about and are googling Wall•E, <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/walle/hd/" title="Wall-E Trailer">view the movie trailer</a>.  Now go on and order tickets for tonight. For the rest of you that saw it, what did you think?</p>
