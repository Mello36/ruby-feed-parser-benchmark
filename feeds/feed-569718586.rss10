<description><![CDATA[This is a true jewel on charming, quiet, tree-lined Willard Street. Architect designed first floor apartment in a 3-unit row house.<br>
<br>
While the Victorian bay-front house was totally gutted during its renovation, the interior was redesigned combining modern conveniences with old charm.<br>
<br>
The architect created a contemporary interior space while using white tiles in kitchen and bathrooms to give you most flexibility with your own colors. The paneled wood doors, all trim and kitchen cabinets resemble the original as do the natural oak floors. High ceilings, walk-in closets, recessed lighting, and custom mini-blinds allow for contemporary or traditional furnishings.<br>
<br>
Living/dining/kitchen areas are combined for today’s living. Huge French doors connect the second bedroom to the living area revealing built-in bookshelves and desk, making this an ideal home office/guest room, while visually increasing your living space when you are without visitors.<br>
<br>
Double glass windows, insulated exterior walls and ceilings, plus high efficiency washer and dryer contribute to energy efficiency.<br>
<br>
No pets, no smoking, please.<br>
$2,525 + utilities. Nearby parking optional @ $200.<br>
1724 Willard St. NW, # 2; closest Intersection: 17th St. and Willard St.<br>
Less than 10 minutes walking distance to Dupont Circle Metro<br>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
<b><i><u>We will be showing this house on Sunday, December 14th between 3:30 and 4:30 pm.  Please e-mail for details and an appointment.</b></i></u>
<p>
Gorgeous townhouse with FOUR bedrooms/offices and a semi-furnished basement, <i> waterfall-style showerhead and jacuzzi tub</i>, and a huge backyard is available starting <u>February 1, 2008</u> with a one-year lease.
<p><b>Pictures are from during the renovation - the house is even more beautiful!</b>
<p>
Here are the advantages to this home:
<li>Huge home (over 2000 square feet) with luxurious, handmade window treatments (including curtains & curtain rods).
<li>Gorgeous, large sunroom attached to master bedroom (perfect for art room, office, or nursery).
<li>FREE top-of-the-line electronic security system with Guardian (R).
<li>Only two blocks to Wonderland and 4 blocks to Giant or metro (Columbia Heights or Petworth)
<li>All stainless steel appliances (including gas stove & brand-new dishwasher).
<li>Brand-new window air conditioning units (only 6 months old!)
<li>Washer/Dryer, and new water heater (less than 1 year-old).
<li>*Original* refurbished hardwood floors.
<li>Large backyard - unique for the city - for BBQs, parking, or pets.
<li>Separate dining, living room, and large kitchenette.
<li>Semi-finished basement with huge storage closet.
<li>Walk Score = 82/100 (<a href="http://www.walkscore.com/get-score.php?street=3555+10th+St%2C+NW%2C+Washington%2C+DC+20010"  rel="nofollow">http://www.walkscore.com/</a>)
<li>Wonderful landlords who leave you alone as long as you pay rent on time!
<p>
For history buffs, this house is amazing!  We have worked hard to refurbish the home WHILE keeping the original doors, windows, floors, and even the door knobs. Also, we had a professional company test the paint & remove high-concentrations of dangerous lead paint. If you are looking at other places, make sure they did this - it is *NOT* enough to paint over lead-based paint!
<p>
There is a $50 credit application fee per tenant, and pets require an additional pet deposit. The security deposit equals one month's rent. To respect the current tenants, we'd like to make all viewings of the house on Sunday afternoons after 3:30 pm.
