Agreed that cutting down a live tree is not the best thing in the world to do, but in this case it's a highly regulated activity by the US Forest Service who says where you can cut, when and what size. When they don't have a bunch of amateurs out there, they cut the trees down themselves to keep a healthy forest. </p><p>It makes the US Forest Service money, and for us it provides a great family tradition. This is our fifth year cutting a tree together as a family. </p><ul>
<li>The first year I had to carry Jacob. </li>
<li>The second year he inexplicably got terrified that we were lost. </li>
<li>The third year I almost dumped Caleb on his head trying to get him in the baby bjorn. And then six year old Jacob very gallantly held my hand so I wouldn't trip and squish his little brother. </li>
<li>Last year Jacob hit one year old Caleb in the face with a snowball. (He misunderstood my directions to *not* aim at his face.) </li>
</ul>
<p>This year we all had a great time! Even the dog!</p>

<p>So, I'm a total dork for posting this but here it is anyway.</p>

<p>I bought the Dev Phone 1 within an hour of the link going up. I'm ditching SERO on Sprint to have an open phone that I can do whatever I please with. My carrier is now T-Mobile. Our 3G network goes live sometime in early January.</p><p>

</p><p>Here are the details that aren't in the pictures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Model number: Android Dev Phone 1<br/>
Firmware Version: 1.0<br/>
Baseband version: 62.33.20.08H_1.22.12.20<br/>
Kernel version: 2.6.25-01843-gfea26b0<br/>
Build number: dream_devphone-userdebug 1.0 UNLOCKED 116222 test-keys</li>
<li>IM application is strictly GTalk only. The T-Mobile version that does Yahoo! and MSN and deducts from your messaging plan is gone.</li>
<li>No My Faves app.</li>
<li>Amazon MP3 is missing; no way to download from Android Market.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the user experience is excellent, so far. I use Google Apps for Your Domain so the two way syncing of everything just works. Updating my contacts list in GMail appears on the phone's dialer almost immediately.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Thought I should give people an update on the ongoing MXF work that is happening in GStreamer. Sebastian Droge is working hard on making sure we have full support for MXF a job not made any easier by the fact that MXF is a very complex container format aimed at a wide range of use cases. We bought the full DVD of specifications from SMPTE recently for Sebastian in order to ensure he had all the documentation needed to get it right.</p>
<p>Thanks to many helpful people in the community we now also have a healthy <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/incoming/mxf/">collection of test files for MXF</a> which should enable us to make sure our demuxer interoperates with all the major MXF creation tools out there.  The MXF demuxer has come quite far, it has still some way left to go, so while you might be able to play back a few files already, it is to early to ask the community to jump in and try to hammer the demuxer with all their files.</p>
<p>Once the demuxer is in the state we want it the plan is to continue onto write a muxer for MXF, a job which should be a little easier as we can start with a minimal part of MXF and extend it over time as long as our initial part is big enough to create valid MXF files. People interested in following development should of course check out gst-plugins-bad from CVS.</p>
<p><b>MPEG TS update</b></p>
<p>On the topic of container formats I have been testing our MPEG TS muxer based on a patch provided by community contributor Vanista. The goal of the testing is making sure the MPEG TS muxer is able to generate files that the Playstation 3 is able to play back perfectly. The Playstation 3 is quite strict about what it supports, so the files you create need to perfectly match the specific profile the PS3 has support for. But once we get this sorted GStreamer should actually become one of the best tools available for creating these files as it seems even on windows people are forced to use a lot of random tools to get a working MPEG TS file with AC3 and H264 inside. My goal is to be able to store the few US DVD’s I have compressed like this on my PS3, as I no longer have a multizone DVD player at home (just using my PS3 these days to play DVD’s). Remuxing the original AC3 audio and compressing the video with H264 seems like the best combination possible for me in terms of balancing storage space use versus sound and image quality. People interested in that effort can follow <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550613">this bug entry</a> (yes I know its a little suboptimal to keep a discussion going on a closed bug <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" height="16" src="http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-smile.png" width="16"/> </p></div>

	Read bugs, followed mail, still pretty groggy; updated to the
latest factory packages. Chat with Vincent. Lunch. Poked make_installer.pl
again - saved another 2 seconds by the somewhat counter-intuitive trick of
turning a 60k entry array into a single string, and then running 20
(pre-compiled) regexps on it - instead of doing ~1 per entry, and
occasionally all 20. 2secs to 0.2secs is quite a win - I wonder why it
was so bad before; I had carefully compiled with <code>qr//</code> the
regexps. Anyhow nice to achieve at least some hack no matter how small.

<p>In Thunderbird, if you want to select all messages in a thread, there are two ways to do it. The shortcut, which is revealed in the Edit menu, is Ctrl-Shift-A. I’ve been using this for years (it broke in Thunderbird 1.5).</p>
<p>The other way, which I discovered recently, is to click on the little threading logo beside the +/-. This is extremely useful if you use the mouse to move messages to other folders from the inbox - just click &amp; drag the little thread icon, you’re done.</p>
<p>To move messages to a different folder without taking your hands off the keyboard, install the Quickmove add-on, and configure shortcuts for common folders in the options.</p>
<p>To move messages to the same folder as the last move in TB, use the Ctrl-Shift-M shortcut.</p>
<p>In Mutt, “ESC t” tags a thread and “;s+.” saves it to a given folder.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> One more Mutt tip, which I found a few minutes ago: Adding the following to .muttrc sets up a Trash folder - deleting mail in any other folder saves it to trash, deleting in trash really deletes.</p>
<pre># set up trash
folder-hook .      'macro index d "&lt;save-message&gt;=trash&lt;enter&gt;"'
folder-hook =trash 'macro index d &lt;delete-message&gt;'</pre></div>

I think perhaps I slept badly last night because today I’ve been feeling rather out of it all day.  I did remember to pay the mortgage at lunchtime, and I got a chance to cook in the evening (I made spag bol).  I was talking to Lampeter University about doing (part time distance learning) Welsh courses with them, and it all seemed possible but it turns out that of course they charge quite a bit more if you live overseas.  And it’s raining like a rather enthusiastic power shower out there, only a lot colder (I just went out in it to buy milk).  Blah.</p></div>

    <title>Where are my messages?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
One of the improvements that we worked on for the Intrepid release is building a <a href="http://gould.cx/ted/blog/Right_side_status">combined applet</a> with the fast user switching, session management and maintaining instant message status.  I'm happy with how this turned out.  I'm planning on continuing the messaging story in Jaunty.
</p>
<p>
An interesting aspect of messaging on the desktop is that while you can get messages, and get a notification of their appearance, you still may want to respond to them.  Currently every messaging app you run provides this through it's own icon into the notification area.  Many people I know have both Pidgin and XChat icons in their notification area routinely.  Besides the fact that both of these work significantly differently, they also are very different visually providing the appearance of clutter in the panel.
</p>
<p>
How do we fix this?  I think that a reasonable approach is to consolidate them into what I'm coining as a "messaging indicator."  The goal of the messaging indicator is provide a simple and clean way for messaging apps to provide the notification to the user that other people are trying to talk them while not having to put something in the notification area.  The notification area is evil.  Here's a simple use case done as an SVG mockup:
</p>
<center>

<blockquote><strong>
I'm sorry, it seems that your browser does not support SVG.  Here is <a href="http://gould.cx/ted/blog.pix/Messaging%20Indicator.svg">the diagram</a>, please upgrade your browser to a newer version.
<br/>
Or, you're reading this through a planet, which apparently doesn't like SVG.  Sadly.
</strong></blockquote>

</center>
<p>
The diagram is simple, and that's a really good thing.  Here we're seeing a <abbr title="Instant Messaging">IM</abbr> message coming in.  The notification disappears into the messaging icon and the message can be found underneath that icon.  Nothing complex, but it allows the user to know that all of their messages are a single tidy place and there is only one graphic required on the panel for all messaging.
</p>
<p>
What is a message?  It's really easy to over reach with the idea of what a message is.  One could say: "Apparmor is messaging me that I can't edit that file."  While that sentence is correct, it's important to note that <em>users don't agree</em>.  So my goal is limit this indicator to messages sent from other humans to the human using the computer.  Now I need to go and fight some feature creep.

    <title>Documentation is important</title>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://stormy.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341c153053ef0105365cd7e9970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Tmobile-romainuy" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c153053ef0105365cd7e9970c " src="http://stormy.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341c153053ef0105365cd7e9970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 20px 5px 0px;"/></a>
 </span> So I have to admit that although I've been preaching for years that open source software needs more documentation, it wasn't really something I worried about. (Probably partially because I have a good network I can always ask when in doubt.) At least that's how I felt until I got my G1 phone.</p><p>I read manuals. I read the G1 manual in a couple of minutes. And then I really wished I had the real manual - one of those that tells you everything about your phone - when ...</p><ul>
<li>At one point in time I saw a list of wireless networks on my G1. Now it just seems to connect to one. I can disconnect and reconnect ... to whichever random network it wants. Nothing in the manual. Some where on my phone has got to be an option that would show me the available wireless networks and let me select one.</li>
<li>I was trying to add shortcuts to the home screen to no avail. A quick google search told me that tapping and holding would show me the most used six apps. Nope, but it did let me add a shortcut!</li>
<li>Speaking of which, my phone does a lot of cool things that I keep accidentally discovering. Like an accidental swipe to the right showed me that the home screen is three times as big as I thought!</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's a really cool phone and it does cool things, but accidentally discovering features one by one makes me feel like I'm missing out. (Not to mention the frustration I feel when I'm trying to do something I know it can do.)</p><p>So I'm not complaining about my G1. I'm just pointing out that good documentation is a good thing. </p><p><em><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/romainguy/2884316310/">romainguy</a>.</span></em></p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A while ago I opened a bug asking to make it easier to use bzr-mirror.gnome.org with JHBuild. I proposed a patch which still needed some love, but wasn’t really sure how to finish it. It added a flag so you can say, “if there is a mirror of this for {bzr,git} users, use it”. Recently, thanks to zeenix pestering, I finished it. Of course he quickly identified some issues, which led to changes to the JHBuild code for svn, git and bzr. Among other things, SVN finally got tag support, and has a more consistent decision making path. And JHBuild-controlled-Git can handle branches a lot nicer now.</p>
<p>We really need to start cleaning the modulesets - one of the biggest problems we had is that the properties are getting misused. “../branches/foobar” is not a module, its part of a path! This is the route to pain, misery and suffering! As I find time I hope to clean this up, but for now the JHBuild mirror seems to be working.</p>
<p>To start using it, just set mirror_policy to “bzr” or “git” in your .jhbuildrc. You probably want a clean slate for this - it won’t doing anything clever in terms of taking over existing SVN checkouts. Another option is</p>
<pre>module_mirror_policy = {
  "conduit": "bzr",
  "foobar": "git,
}</pre>
<p>I hope to get JHBuild to automate git-svn a little here too (and automatically git-svn init) where appropriate.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When I saw that <a href="http://gould.cx/ted/blog/Saving_the_world_one__w_at_a_time">post</a>, I dived into the list of “affected” programs, and went “ooohhh!!!” because <a href="http://www.ekiga.org">ekiga</a> was in the list.</p>
<p>I played the grep game in the sources, quickly found a few places where the problem applied and patched… then stumbled on a place where the fix was half-in. Why half? Because there was a #if GLIB_CHECK_VERSION(2,14,0) … #else … #endif ! After the first moment of surprise (gaping mouth), I jumped into configure.ac and saw that indeed we only require glib version 2.8.0. Ha!</p>
<p>I modified every applicable place to use g_timeout_add_seconds only if the right glib version is available even though I really don’t like #if code : consider the problem fixed for ekiga!</p>
<p>So there are a few things to know about this problem :</p>
<ul>
<li>one can’t just patch like this because maybe the maintainers still support an older glib : either the dep has to stay lower and #if/#else/#endif should be used, or the expected version should be raised ;</li>
<li>even if grep says there’s a problem in a program, it may just be seeing the #else part of a #if GLIB_CHECK_VERSION part : there are false positives!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Ted for the heads up!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
  Do you regularly ssh into machines which have dynamic IP addresses, and get
  really annoyed with OpenSSH warning that the IP's key doesn't match the host
  key?  I certainly do, with machines announce their names using mDNS and a DHCP
  server in my router.  Today I finally checked the documentation and found out
  how to skip this check.
</p>
<p>
  The magic option is <tt>CheckHostIP</tt>, which you can set
  in <tt>.ssh/config</tt> on a per-host level.  I've got this in
  my <tt>config</tt>:
</p>
<pre>Host *.local
  CheckHostIP no</pre>
<p>
  Now all machines I ssh into using a <tt>.local</tt> domain won't have their
  IP's key checked against the host key, because the IP is dynamic.  Sorted!

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve been using SQL consoles for years. Each database has its own SQL console: <strong>psql</strong> for PostgreSQL, <strong>mysql</strong> for MySQL, <strong>sqlite3</strong> for SQLite3, <strong>sqlplus</strong> for Oracle,… When one needs information about database objects such as for example the tables, their columns and relations with other tables, one has to remember the syntax to use depending on th SQL console (for example to list the tables: <strong>\dt</strong> for PostgreSQL, <strong>show tables;</strong> for MySQL, <strong>select name from sqlite_master where type=’table’;</strong> for SQLite3).</p>
<p>This can be quite frustrating when using several databases and consoles, and is the reason I decided to write yet another SQL console, part of Libgda which overcomes all these little difficulties. The syntax (and displayed information) is the same for every database Libgda can connect to.</p>
<p>I’ve recently improved it even more by turning the SQL console into a web server to display meta data in a user friendly way. Here is the use case: the user uses the SQL console normally and then decides to start the web server (through a <strong>\http</strong> command) and then points his web browser to <strong>http://localhost:12345</strong> (the port number can also be specified). Here is below the kind of information displayed:</p>

<p>There is at the moment no security around the web server (anyone can connect) but this will be added.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The more I think about it the more I don’t want to pick a single DVCS for GNOME. It should be up to whoever is doing the work to use whatever tools they want. Unfortunately having each module choose its own hosting format has its own problems - do i need to check out gnome-super-cool from bzr.gnome.org or darcs.gnome.org? What if maintainer A likes cvs and maintainer B likes Git.</p>
<p>&lt;snipped out the bit where i ramble about all the different options people have already suggested. me rambling FTYawn&gt;</p>
<p>There is another approach. The Git protocol is quite easy. The Git pack container format is easy. The basic Git objects are easy. Who says i have to store Git packs in Git? As long as the client Git can grab packs and push packs it is happy. All other operations are local.</p>
<p>So lets take bzr-playground and run something that provides git:// and git+ssh:// access to the bazaar repositories. Push and pull. We’ll still have a central point from which we can view and checkout a GNOME module and the infra work can focus on a single platform. But the choice of tool i use to do my work is (partially at least) back down to me.</p>
<p>I am currently able to read and write the pack container format as well as speak a decent amount of the git-upload-pack and git-receive-pack protocols. It won’t be the first time i’ve serialized or deserialized git objects, so that won’t take very long. Then its just a case of storing things in Bazaar and maintaining a cache of sha1 to bazaar id. Sure, i’m trivializing here, but i am confident that this is doable.</p>
<p>I’m linking to the code I have so far (its an extension of bzr-git) as a gesture that this isnt total vaporware, but it’s not really anything you can try yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.launchpad.net/~johncarr/bzr-git/git-serve">lp:~johncarr/bzr-git/git-serve</a></p>
<p>At this point im mainly interested in collecting +1’s and -1’s on the basic concept.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Few days ago I was connected through Numericable and I started wireshark to diagnose a local issue.</p>
<p>I was suprised to see a lot of traffic, the most visible one was about 20 ARP requests per second, coming from their routers and asking for other customers.
</p><pre>Cisco_29:c1:05        Broadcast             ARP      Who has 89.3.183.58?  Tell 89.3.176.1

<p>That's surprising than they forward the ARP broadcast to the local network, but that's not the interesting part.</p>
<p>Hidden in the flow, were quite a lot of DHCP answers I will now comment on.</p>
<p>Here is common part of all the DHCP answer, nothing very interesting:
</p><pre>Ethernet II, Src: Cisco_29:c1:05 (00:15:f9:29:c1:05), Dst: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
Internet Protocol, Src: 10.27.0.1 (10.27.0.1), Dst: 255.255.255.255 (255.255.255.255)
User Datagram Protocol, Src Port: bootps (67), Dst Port: bootpc (68)
    Message type: Boot Reply (2)</pre><p/>
<p>First the ones for the user machines, probably when the modem is not set up as a router, as the one I was connected to had given me a 192.168.0.x address and was masquerading me :
</p><pre>Your (client) IP address: 89.3.125.59 (89.3.125.59)
    Relay agent IP address: 85.69.128.1 (85.69.128.1)
    Client MAC address: HewlettP_5b:cf:a9 (00:1a:4b:5b:cf:a9)
    Option: (t=53,l=1) DHCP Message Type = DHCP ACK
    Option: (t=54,l=4) Server Identifier = 172.20.230.15
    Option: (t=1,l=4) Subnet Mask = 255.255.248.0
    Option: (t=3,l=4) Router = 89.3.120.1
<br/>
    Your (client) IP address: 89.3.178.52 (89.3.178.52)
    Relay agent IP address: 85.69.128.1 (85.69.128.1)
    Client MAC address: AsustekC_7f:3d:ee (00:15:f2:7f:3d:ee)
    Option: (t=53,l=1) DHCP Message Type = DHCP Offer
    Option: (t=54,l=4) Server Identifier = 172.20.130.15
    Option: (t=1,l=4) Subnet Mask = 255.255.240.0
    Option: (t=3,l=4) Router = 89.3.176.1</pre><p/>
<p>So, I get the IP and MAC of other customer's machines, still not very interesting</p>
<p/><pre>Relay agent IP address: 85.69.128.1 (85.69.128.1)
    Client MAC address: AppleCom_ef:8e:24 (00:30:65:ef:8e:24)
    Option: (t=53,l=1) DHCP Message Type = DHCP NAK
    Option: (t=56,l=95) Message = "Requested lease 85.69.128.190 was active and assigned to different client: 01:00:1f:33:de:10:cd"
    Option: (t=54,l=4) Server Identifier = 172.20.130.15</pre><p/>
<p>Does this mean you can't change the connected machine until the (1 hour) lease has expired ?</p>
<p>Now some more interesting ones, for the modems. The common part, giving internal addresses of their servers: 
</p><pre>    Next server IP address: 172.20.143.8 (172.20.143.8)
    Relay agent IP address: 10.27.0.1 (10.27.0.1)
    Option: (t=53,l=1) DHCP Message Type = DHCP Offer
    Option: (t=54,l=4) Server Identifier = 172.20.143.15
    Option: (t=1,l=4) Subnet Mask = 255.255.128.0
    Option: (t=3,l=4) Router = 10.27.0.1
    Option: (t=4,l=4) Time Server = 172.20.143.1</pre><p/>
<p>And now the interesting part, the one which changes:
</p><pre>    Your (client) IP address: 10.27.74.224 (10.27.74.224)
    Client MAC address: Motorola_5e:34:82 (00:0e:5c:5e:34:82)
    Boot file name: selfprov.cm
<br/>
    Your (client) IP address: 10.27.59.77 (10.27.59.77)
    Client MAC address: NVPhilip_4b:be:4c (00:90:3e:4b:be:4c)
    Boot file name: s9e_30m_1m_01.cm
<br/>
    Your (client) IP address: 10.27.65.27 (10.27.65.27)
    Client MAC address: NVPhilip_56:18:e3 (00:90:3e:56:18:e3)
    Boot file name: s9e_512k_128k_01.cm</pre><p/>
<p>So, there are two brands of modem, and boot file is different if you subscribed to the 30Mb/1Mb offer, or to the 512kb/128kb one. Would your connection get faster if you trick your modem into getting the other file? I don't know but I would not be surprised...</p>
<p>I had thought of getting a connection through them in addition to my current DSL, as they promise 100Mb/s here before the end of 2008 (which is almost finished). After this experience I have decided to never subscribe to their services, playing with their network would be too tempting.</p>
<p>I think I didn't do anything bad, only looked at packets sent to me on the local network :) I didn't even try to see if the 10.x addresses are routed by the modem (I'm almost sure they are not).</p>
<p>Another point, all people in this building connected with Numericable (that's 12 of them) have WEP network on channel 6. I hope the modem supports WPA and selecting other channels.</p></div>

After watching the latest Halloween special from The Simpsons in which there was a Charlie Brown spoof, I had a blast from the past and I managed to get a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_Named_Charlie_Brown">A Boy Named Charlie Brown</a>, but this time in english.<br/><br/></p><center><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W2HC0258L.jpg"/></center><br/><br/>The story is about how Charlie Brown cannot succeed in anything and suddenly he figures out how good he is in spelling bees, ending up in the national contest representing his school. I forgot how charming that movie was, and nowadays, with some more years in my back I appreciate it a lot more. The move is from 1969 and despite that the animation is stunning, the jazz soundtrack gives a great background and pace, and the songs are quite emotive, something quite different from the Disney factory back in the days.<br/><br/>All in all, a charming movie for both kids and not so kids that will always have a special place in my memories. <br/><p/></div>

    <title>i, lucifer</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div><blockquote><p>"Long ago you broke off your yoke<br/>and tore off your bonds;<br/>you said, 'I will not serve you!'<br/>Indeed, on every high hill<br/>and under every spreading tree<br/>you lay down as a prostitute."</p><p>Jeremiah 2:20, NIV</p></blockquote><p>While browsing through a used bookstore on my recent trip to the States, a yellowed pamphlet fell out of one of the books. I bought the book for five bucks, careful not to reveal the existence of the insert, whose contents I reproduce here.</p><blockquote><p> Dear diary,</p><p>Finally, my job search has ended at last! I got this sweet new job over at the department of administration. I met my new co-workers last week, Mike and Gabriel ("Gabe to my friends", he says). They're new too, so it seems we're all going to be learning together.</p><p>The boss says we have to be presentable at all times, so I guess that means goodbye to my scruffy goatee. Oh well, it's a worthwhile sacrifice -- it really seems like this is the break I've been waiting for all these years and years.</p><p>Anyway, things are really busy now -- I'll write soon!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Luke</p><p><center>* * *</center></p><p>Dear diary,</p><p>The job's still going pretty good, though the boss is a pretty hard taskmaster. Every day I'm out at the branch offices telling other workers how to do their job. I feel bad for them, they're totally overworked. Well, I am too. We hardly get any time with the harp!</p><p>Anyway, seems I got a bit agitated there. I guess it's to be expected, given that I have to keep it all in during the day. Still, the benefits are pretty sweet, and I have to admit I look pretty great in my work uniform.</p><p>Otherwise, all seems OK. I know I've been pretty bad at writing recently, but I'll try to write back soon.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Luke</p><p><center>* * *</center></p><p>Dear diary,</p><p>I am starting to get pretty fed up with those brown-nosers Mike and Gabriel (no, I'm not his friend). All the time it's like "What can I do for you, Lord?" "Lord, your might is without limit!" "Lord, Lord, Lord, blah, blah, blah." Grrr! Don't those guys have any self-respect?</p><p>Plus, the workers that they manage have been raising hell. The strike last week at the border nearly stopped immigration completely. And the crackdown... wow. It was pretty brutal -- "feathers were flying", as they say.</p><p>Well, just keeping my head low for the time being. I'll rap at ya later.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Luke</p><p><center>* * *</center></p><p>Dear diary,</p><p>It seems like my discontent has been making the rounds. Today I got fired for "insubordination".</p><p>I guess it all came to a head when I gave that speech at the gate rally, saying I was tired of being Seraph's Deputy. The cheers and flapping from the crowd felt good then, but now I'm out of work, and that also means I'm out of the company housing.</p><p>The "Lord" claims to know where I'll go now, but I don't know that myself. I asked Mike if I could stay at his place; we'll see what he says.</p><p>Further bulletins as events warrant,</p><p>Luke</p><p><center>* * *</center></p><p>Dear diary,</p><p>I've settled on an unused piece of land, just down the valley from where I used to live. I can see the hills and clouds from my shack, and I'll have to admit that life was pretty privileged when I lived up there. But I'm finding things about my new environment that are quite nice as well -- the lush greenery, the salamanders in the river, and the simple pleasures of honest work, tossing hay to my goats with a pitchfork.</p><p>I don't see much of my old co-workers anymore, and to be honest I don't miss them much. I do have to work sometimes for farms around the valley just for part of their harvests, but I'm pretty happy working for myself.</p><p>Anyway, that's that. Time to go tend the fire, it gets cold here at night.</p><p>Laters,</p><p>Luke</p></blockquote><p>Though I think the diary continues, my pamphlet ends here. I'll let<br/>y'all know if I find more pieces of it.</p></div></div>

So there we have it - another launch event and OpenSolaris 2008.11 goes officially out the door, blessed by holy goat pee. Another release out on time. Hooray for time based release schedules - they really are excellent, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">thanks GNOME</a>!
</p>
<p>
There’s a couple of really big milestones for this release -</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/">pkg</a> team have done wonders in this release. There are now a few new repositories - <a href="http://pkg.opensolaris.org/release/">release</a>, <a href="http://pkg.opensolaris.org/contrib/">contrib</a>, <a href="http://pkg.opensolaris.org/pending/">pending</a> and <a href="http://pkg.opensolaris.org/dev/">dev</a>, along with an encumbered repository (including VirtualBox and Flash for Firefox) and supported repositories on <a href="http://pkg.sun.com/register/">pkg.sun.com</a>.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/gman/2008/12/10/mirroring-opensolaris-iso-images/">talked about mirroring the ISO images</a> (thank you for those who have already signed up), and now <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sch/">Stephen</a> has posted instructions to allow others to <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/Mirroring/">mirror the package repositories</a> themselves. There’s still a few hurdles here, but this is a significant step for users right around the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/erwann/">Erwann</a> has written extensively about <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/erwann/entry/time_slider_screencast">Time Slider</a>, and has has a lovely screencast demo of it that I’d encourage everyone to look at. More importantly though, it’s one of the first projects to really include the benefits of using OpenSolaris into an easy to use interface (ZFS + GNOME - mmmm, tasty!). Nice work Erwann, Niall and Tim!</li>
<li>Really, really excited by the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/pkgfactory/">pkgfactory</a> and <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/sourcejuicer/">source juicer</a> projects - along with Jim’s excellent <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/sw-porters/contributing/">guidelines</a> for how users can contribute packages, I hope to see the repositories above be full of the best of breed open source software that are being used regularly on other platforms. It’s embarrassing to think that Solaris was such a second citizen when it came to open source software previously, and I’m thrilled we’re making progress on this front.</li>
<li>Continual progress from the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/Caiman">Install</a> team - with the likes of distribution constructor and automated install really coming along nicely. The team put in some really hard work in keeping the memory footprint to 512MB in the LiveCD (and absolutely delighted to see <a href="http://defect.opensolaris.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=1119">  Jürgen’s work</a> in improving the performance of LZMA compressed LiveCDs).</li>
</ul>
<p>
6 months has really flown, and it’s really been great to see some awesome progress being made. We’ve taken a leaf out of the GNOME community once again, and put together a <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/features/whats-new/200811/">What’s new in 2008.11</a> guide, similar to their <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.24/">release notes</a>. This is a very graphically oriented guide to just a small selection of new features that you can get your hands on with this release - looking forward to seeing blogs and screencasts of the features that you are excited with.
</p>
<p>
If you’re updating from a standard 2008.05 install, make sure to check out <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/weber/entry/upgrade_from_opensolaris_2008_05">Markus’ excellent screencast</a> - there are some tricky bits here due to a couple of bad bugs in 2008.05, but once you get to 2008.11 you’ll never look back!</p></div>

    <title>Saving the world one uW at a time</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
I'm here at <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSJaunty"><abbr title="Ubuntu Developer's Summit">UDS</abbr></a> and joined a session between the kernel and desktop teams talking about power.  Like all of such sessions the kernel team thinks that the desktop should fix all the problems and vice versa.  At their suggestion, I took an action item.
</p>
<p>
One of the features of GTK+ is that it provides two timeout functions: <tt>gtk_timeout_add</tt> and <tt>gtk_timeout_add_seconds</tt>.  The difference is much more important than not having to add a <tt>"* 1000"</tt> in one and not the other.  The important thing that the second function does is that it tried to group wake-ups to ensure that the program wakes up as little as possible.  This is never perfect, but it's a small thing that can help to save some power and reduce the number of wake-ups.
</p>
<p>
So I looked through the Ubuntu main archive to figure out how many applications use the more precise function, but just pass in several seconds as the parameter.  I figured this would be a few apps, and I'd submit a couple patches, then I could go back to blaming the kernel team for all our problems.  There are more than a couple packages.  There are a lot of packages.  The <a href="http://gould.cx/ted/blog.files/no_timeout_seconds_main.txt">results of the grep</a> and <a href="http://gould.cx/ted/blog.files/no_timeout_seconds_main_pkgs.txt">a cleaned up list of packages</a> that are likely to have easy fixes.
</p>
<p>
I realize now that I can't do this by myself, the only hope is to document how to fix it.
</p>
<p>
So if you'd like to help save a little power on your machine, follow these instructions.
</p><ol>
<li>
Take one of the packages in <a href="http://gould.cx/ted/blog.files/no_timeout_seconds_main_pkgs.txt">the list above</a> and find it in the <a href="http://package-import.ubuntu.com/">package repository</a> <i>(<a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-November/000514.html">instructions</a>)</i>.
</li>
<li>
Branch it: <br/>
<tt>$ bzr branch http://package-import.ubuntu.com/x/xproject/jaunty localfix</tt>
</li>
<li>
Find the instances that might be causing the problem.<br/><tt>$ rgrep timeout_add *</tt>
</li>
<li>
Commit and build a package:<br/>
<tt>$ bzr commit -m "Saving the world"</tt><br/>
<tt>$ dch -i</tt><br/>
<tt>$ debuild</tt>
</li>
<li>
Test it on your system, make sure things still work reasonably.
</li>
<li>
Generate a patch: <br/>
<tt>$ bzr diff -r ancestor:</tt>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream#line-12">Submit it upstream!</a>
</li>
</ol>

    <title>Improving Login Time, Part 3: bootcharting</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Been a while since last instalment.  So, having tightened up gnome-settings-daemon, I headed to get an overview of the entire login process, using the venerable <a href="http://www.bootchart.org/">bootchart</a>.  Before I jump in, bootchart is cool and everything, but if someone wants a smallish project to hack on, port the bootchart graphing tool from Java to pycairo.  It's some 5k lines of code and should shrink considerably.  Then we can make an interactive tool based on that and other pycairo scripts we have.  I can see how that can turn into a profiler thingy in the long run...<br/><br/><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/1.gnome-session.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/1.gnome-session.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a> For this assignment I updated my home machine to latest Fedora 10, created a new user, and bootcharted gnome-session in a warm login.  I got the chart at right (click to enlarge).  Lets see how it looks:<ul><li>The CPU becomes idle at 18 seconds in.  The little activity lingering after is the bootchart overhead.  That's a long time to log in!</li><li>Doh, the CPU becomes idle for a couple of seconds in the middle.</li><li>There's intense CPU activity periods caused by a many processes, namely, gnome-settings-daemon, wnck-applet, clock-applet, gdm-user-switch, and less intense in gnome-panel, nautilus, notification-daemon, and sealert.</li><li>gnome-settings-daemon is terminating!</li></ul>This doesn't look right.  Lets look at inside:<br/><br/><h3>The CPU idle time</h3>Let me quote parts of <a href="http://mces.blogspot.com/2008/10/improving-login-time-part-1-gnome.html">my first post</a> about how gnome-session works: <blockquote>To transition to the next phase, the current phase should either complete or time out. A phase is complete when all apps associated with the phase signal completion. An app can signal completion in a variety of ways, the simplest of which being that the process terminates. A phase times out after ten seconds. Description for the phases as well as a more a longer version of this condensed overview is available in gnome-session/gnome-session/README.</blockquote>  With that in mind, the two second idle looks a hell lot like a phase timeout.  Inspecting <code>~/.xsession-errors</code> and searching for gnome-session confirms that:<pre style="font-size: smaller;">gnome-session: Application 'libcanberra-login-sound' failed to register before timeout</pre>Oh oh! <code>/usr/share/gnome/autostart/libcanberra-login-sound.desktop</code> is where this <em>application</em> lives, and it contains these lines:<pre style="font-size: smaller;">Exec=/usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play --id="desktop-login" --description="GNOME Login"<br/>AutostartCondition=GNOME /desktop/gnome/sound/event_sounds<br/>X-GNOME-Autostart-Phase=Desktop</pre>That is, it runs <code>canberra-gtk-play</code> in the Desktop phase of gnome-session.  So what's happening?  gnome-session is waiting for canberra-gtk-play to finish playing login sound, how cool is that!?  Not only gnome-session waits for it to finish playing, even when it does (after five seconds), gnome-session fails to notice that.  So it waits another five seconds until the phase times out and it proceeds to the next phase.  To verify this, note that in the graph, canberra-gtk-play starts at about 3.2 seconds in, and the CPU picks up activity again, at 13.2.<br/><br/>Why does it happen?  Shouldn't gnome-session at least continue after the five-second playing is over?  Well, yes according to the README document, no according to the code:<pre style="font-size: smaller;">  if (manager-&gt;priv-&gt;phase == GSM_MANAGER_PHASE_INITIALIZATION) {<br/>       /* Applications from Initialization phase are considered<br/>        * registered when they exit normally. This is because<br/>        * they are expected to just do "something" and exit */<br/>       app_registered (app, manager);<br/>}</pre><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/2.gnome-session.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/2.gnome-session.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a> So, only Initialization phase was handled that way.  Not hard to fix.  Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563640">filed</a>, <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=124315&amp;action=view">patch</a> submitted.  Then I also patched libcanberra to add a --background option to canberra-gtk-play.  <a href="https://tango.0pointer.de/pipermail/libcanberra-discuss/2008-December/000145.html">Reported</a> and <a href="https://tango.0pointer.de/pipermail/libcanberra-discuss/attachments/20081207/805fb937/attachment.txt">patch</a> submitted.  There is an alternate, much shorter, fix: move login sound to Application phase which is the last phase.  Applications in the Application phase are not required to notify the session of their startup.  That's a one line fix.  The gnome-session fix is still a good thing to do.  Anyway, with that fixed I got down from 18 to 13 seconds.  Not bad!<br/><br/><h3>The Mess</h3><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/3.gnome-panel.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/3.gnome-panel.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a> Lets see what's making the login take that long.  The last batch of processes to start are the panel applets (clock-applet, wcnk-applet, trashapplet, gdm-user-switch, and notification-area) that start around 8 seconds in.  The panel on the other hand starts at 3.  What is the panel doing for those 5 seconds?!  Time to switch tools and take a look inside panel.  Federico <a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Efederico/news-2008-02.html#panel-startup-2">looked</a> at it in February, so I reused his patch and added more annotations as needed.  The image at right is the first timeline view of what's happening inside gnome-panel.  There are three large gaps there.  The first one is the linker working hard.  The second one is gnome_program_init().  I have absolutely no idea why those two are taking so long.  Those two are very unstable though and go up and down in different runs.  I will look into them later.<br/><br/>But the largest gap by far is the third one, which happens inside the first size_request(), and after I added enough annotations, it became clear that it's happening when pango is measuring fonts for the first time.  Ouch!  Checking the <code>strace</code> log, it becomes clear that fontconfig is opening three East Asian fonts.  Why?  It's not supposed to.  Well, at least not if its cache is up to date.  I then run <code>fc-match</code> and observe that it takes over a second.  I try <code>fc-cache</code> and it errs about not being able to update cache for two East Asian font directories on my system.  Humm, this is a first for me, although I confess I get reports about situations like this all the time...  Reading more log, it appeared that opening cache files in <code>~/.fontconfig</code> was failing as Permission denied!  Weird stuff.  Inspecting ~/.fontconfig revealed the reason: It had the following permissions: <code>drw-rw-r--</code>.  Where did the <code>x</code> permissions go?  This was a new user account, so the first process to call into fontconfig would have been gnome-settings-daemon.  Oh my!  In one of my patches from <a href="http://mces.blogspot.com/2008/11/improving-login-time-part-2-gnome.html">the last round</a>, I had replaced a call to the glibc function <code>daemon()</code> with custom code that I lifted from <a href="http://preload.sf.net/">preload</a>, which I had lifted from some other daemon back in 2005.  Anyway, seems like the daemonizing code there had a <code>umask (0177);</code> call in it, and no one's eyes ever caught the bug there.  That mask is fine for files, but directories created under that are absolutely useless.  And since Nov 25 we backported those changes into Fedora 10!  Chaos!  I had to go clean that up.  Filed and fixed the <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563543">bug</a> in g-s-d first, and pushed fixed versions in F10 and rawhide.  Then filed <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18934">bug</a> with fontconfig to fix it there too.  Will look into that this week.<br/><br/>Next question was, why wasn't the system font cache updated anyway?  Normally the users should not need to cache anything unless they have installed fonts in their home directory.  I checked the RPM spec for the offending font packages.  Dang, the spec files had a <code>umask 0133</code> before calling <code>fc-cache</code>.  Oops.  Removed those and pushed updates out.  However, that does *not* justify it as fc-cache doesn't need to create any directory when updating system-wide caches.  That's still a mystery.  Got to reinstall the broken RPMs to see what's going on.<br/><br/>Anyway, I then looked into gnome-settings-daemon to see why it was crashing.  It was gstreamer crashing it.  As I <a href="http://mces.blogspot.com/2008/10/improving-login-time-part-1-gnome.html">found</a> last time, gstreamer initialization forks and tries to update the cache.  The fork being there to not crash the parent process in case a plugin goes south.  However, if updating the cache fails in the child process, it then retries from the parent.  If that fails too, it just exits!  The reason it wasn't updating the cache successfully?  The same umask(0177).  Now I remember,  I can actually blame <a href="http://www.vuntz.net/">Vincent</a>!  When he was releasing GNOME 2.25.1.

Looked so innocent for sure.  Not very clear who let it go.  Vincent says he'll sue me for posting this log anyway.<br/><br/>Later on I also got mail from a Fedora user saying that the umask thing also created problems for him with ORBit.  I already <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=493F00D5.5040900%40behdad.org&amp;forum_name=gstreamer-devel">reported</a> to gstreamer devs, and will fix the fontconfig one myself.  If anyone can look into ORBit, that would be great.<br/><br/>Lesson learned the hard way:  In your library code, when you mkdir(), do a chmod() immediately.  If you have not been doing it before, you may also want to consider trying a chmod if writing to the directory fails.  umask issues have affected many many packages in Fedora before.  Users install RPMs with limited umask and all kind of things break.  better fix it in the libraries and programs, instead of distros adding umask to their specs and getting it wrong...<br/><br/><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/4.gnome-panel.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/4.gnome-panel.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a>Oh, the timing.  Fixing these, the huge gap in the panel shrank drastically, from 1.4 seconds to 0.13 seconds.  130ms is still a long time to spend in fontconfig.  Seems like about 60% of that is just opening and reading/mmap'ing the config and cache files.  That can be improved by reducing the number of files: packaging more font files in the same directory, and avoiding micro config files.  Fortunately Nicolas is on the right track to fix these in Fedora.  The other 40% is spent on the first FcFontSort() call.  I have ideas about how to improve that, and will look into it in the coming days.<br/><br/>Do we need to call into fontconfig there?  The panel needs to know the height of the default font to calculate the minimum panel height and enforce that.  Sounds like a good idea, but knowing that the panel properties dialog does not let you resize it to below the minimum height, this check is redundant unless you managed to modify the gconf key directly or changed the font size while panel was not running.  In other words, the exceptional case.  If we can avoid that call, g-s-m can go to next phase some 130ms earlier.<br/><br/>There is another 90ms gap in the graph, and that is GTK+ finding the icon cache to use and loading the panel icon.  Right, the panel has an icon!  If I remove the <code>gtk_window_set_default_icon_name()</code> call the gap shrinks considerably, but then when you ctrl+alt+tab you won't see the cute gnome-panel icon.  Donno, maybe we can set the icon later to avoid holding the entire session back for 90ms.<br/><br/>Lets step back and look though.  fontconfig cache, gstreamer plugin cache, icon cache.  We've got so many caches, which actually do wonders, but just finding and opening them still takes a lot of time.  The gstreamer case is easy to fix since it has a single cache file in a single directory, it's just that it currently is doing unnecessary checks.  The fontconfig and icon caches are harder to fix.  The libraries have to look into multiple directories and read multiple config files to use the cache.  It stinks.  There used to be a short period of time that fontconfig generated one fat cache file for all the fonts. That's a terrible idea when you need to regenerate the cache every time a new font is installed.  But what if we had a "git gc"-like mode to merge multiple cache files into one?  New font dirs will go into new cache files, until next time, either manually or automatically, <code>fc-cache --compact</code> is invoked...  I'll think about it.<br/><br/>I said "holding the entire session back" twice in previous paragraphs.  This was not actually happening: gnome-panel was registering with the session as first thing in its main() (it's implied in the gnome_program_init() call), and the session was taking that as "I'm ready, go to next phase".  Which means that Nautilus may start up and draw icons before the panel has had a chance to set its struts.  Net result is that Nautilus icons will jump down when the panel gets to set up the struts.  So I <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563635">wrote</a> patch for that.  But that didn't fix the problem, another bug was in the play.  Two hours of debugging later, I <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554343#c8">fixed</a> that too.<br/><br/><h3>The rest</h3><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/5.gnome-session.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/5.gnome-session.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a> With this mess cleaned, login time is back down to a sane 5.5s.  gnome-panel is not taking much CPU time anymore.  Nautilus some.  Other than those, two things stand out: <code>python</code> and <code>sealert</code>.  sealert is an applet to "View &amp; interpret SELinux denials".  It's written in python.  Worse, when starting, it calls over D-BUS to start a server instance of itself, in another python process, and the two wait for SELinux denials to happen so they can report it to you using notification-daemon bubbles... for you to click and dismiss.  Srsly, what the heck is Aunt Tillie to do with them?  Forget Aunt Tillie, what is even a tech-savvy user to do with them?  We were at the Fedora 10 <a href="http://overholt.ca/wp/?p=112">release party</a> in Seneca a couple weeks ago and a user asked me what these bubbles are.  I explained to him, and he said "I just close them because they happen all the time".  Which is true.  It's great if you are debugging why your HTTP server does not serve your files, but is it good for anything else?  Certainly not enough to be enabled by default.  Please, disable sealert by default and help save the planet.   In the mean time, I also <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563642">proposed</a> adding an additional phase to gnome-session which would run after the Application phase and is for starting processes that do not render to the desktop immediately, because those can start at the end, to give a better perception of desktop having loaded completely.  sealert technically falls into that category.  In practice however, it pops up a bubble before the login is done.  In many setups at least.<br/><br/>I think the same argument also applies to the <code>kerneloops-applet</code>.  Maybe enable these in Rawhide so people report bugs, but disable them in stable release.  I'm pretty sure that's the right thing to do.  kerneloops-applet is quite light on the CPU though.  Removing sealert, kerneloops-applet, and some other lightweight tasks that I don't need, I get down to 4.5 seconds.  The biggest CPU consumer now is Nautilus, and it's taking three seconds to settle down.  Federico <a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Efederico/news-2006-03.html#login-time-1">looked</a> into it before, and I will too at some point.  But I first want to fix fontconfig.  The <acronym title="return on investment">ROI</acronym> on that is huge: every application startup can become something between 50ms to 100ms faster if I my ideas work out.<br/><br/><h3>Big picture</h3>One wise Federico once <a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Efederico/docs/2007-02-FOSDEM/html/img25.html">said</a> "Set concrete goals", although people now attribute that wisdom to <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/299483/">Arjan</a> these days.  Regardless, let's set a concrete goal: I want to make Fedora default install, new user, warm login in three second.  That may not happen next year, but that's where we need to be if we ever want to boot, say, in 15 seconds.  Why optimize warm login when cold is so much worse?  Because to make cold login go under 5 seconds, one first has to make warm do that.  My other argument is that ideally people suspend their computer instead of shutting down, so first boot is the wrong thing to optimize.  Warm login on the other hand is still common in multi-user systems.  Moreover, my hope is that a 3 second warm login plus opportunistic preload'ing at login screen will give us a first login of about 5 seconds.  Long road to there; we will see.  By the way, 3.5 years later, Federico's GUADEC <a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Efederico/docs/2006-GUADEC/how-much-faster/index.html">keynote</a> is still pure gold.<br/><br/>How would we get there?  By making fontconfig not suck 100ms for each application.  By fixing Nautilus, whatever it is doing that it shouldn't.  By getting rid of libgnome dependencies.  By figuring out why linking is so slow.  And by not running sealert and other unnecessary stuff.<br/><br/><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/6.gnome-session.cold.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/6.gnome-session.cold.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a> To keep things in perspective, lets have a quick look at cold login to see what's there to optimize.  The image at right shows a cold login of the same desktop I used above.   Lots of I/O, and 14 seconds login time.  The CPU goes way down for extend periods of time, when panel, Nautilus, pulseaudio, and python are all doing heavy I/O.  No idea what they are reading, but looks like something that should be possible to fix.<br/><br/><a href="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/7.gnome-session.preload.png"><img src="http://gnome.org/%7Ebehdad/login/3/7.gnome-session.preload.small.png" style="float: right;"/></a> This next one is with preload running.  Down to 12 seconds.  Not much really.  Looks like it failed to preload anything that those four I/O-heavy processes use.  No wonder, because preload can only preload stuff that are mmap()ed.  That mostly translates to shared libraries.  A more advanced prefetching solution, like Harold's readahead_collector that monitors all I/O will be able to solve this.  Oh, Harold by the way <a href="http://www.harald-hoyer.de/personal/blog/fedora-10-disk-io">blogged</a> recently about using <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">systemtap</a> to measure boot-time I/O.  He's actually looking at me to fix gconf I/O issues, and that's exactly what I'm going to do with his script when I get to that stage.<br/><br/>If you read this far, I owe you your beverage of choice.

On a second note about the action removal: While I of course agree that it is bad thing if a notification -that you could potentially miss- is the prominent (or even the only) way when a  user interaction is required, I don’t get what is wrong with using actions (that includes clicking on them) as a shortcut to something.</p>

	      <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/news-2008-12.html#pushing-and-pulling-with-git-2"><strong>Pushing and pulling with Git, part 2</strong></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      (<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/index.html#git">Index to the "Pushing and pulling with Git" series</a>)
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      In <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/news-2008-11.html#pushing-and-pulling-with-git-1">part
	      1</a>, we saw how Git makes commits to the repository
	      and how it keeps track of the current branch and other
	      branches.  We also saw how remote repositories get
	      registered with your local repository, and how we can
	      fetch changes from them.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      In this part, we will see how to visualize what is in the
	      set of fetched changes, and how to integrate those
	      changes into our branches.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>Your first commits to a project</strong>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Let's say you want to start contributing to the
	      <em>box-of-crayons</em> project, an enterprise-level
	      paint program.  When you first start developing for
	      this project, you do something like
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <tt>git clone git://git.paintastic.com/box-of-crayons.git</tt>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      (Some shitbag is hoarding that domain name, by the way.)
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Your initial repository looks something like this:
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Just-cloned repository" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-8.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>(1)</strong> is the commit at the tip of your
	      "master" branch; HEAD points to it since this is also
	      your current branch.  This is exactly the same as the
	      "master" branch in the origin repository (i.e. the one
	      in git.paintastic.com).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>(2)</strong> is a commit from which the
	      maintainer of box-of-crayons started a maintenance
	      branch for version 1.0 of the program.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>(3)</strong> is the tip of the remote's
	      "1.0-branch".  You don't have a local ref here yet,
	      <em>but all the commits in that branch exist in your
	      repository</em>.  You can examine them with
	      "<tt>git log origin/1.0-branch</tt>" and
	      "<tt>git show <em>&lt;commit-hash&gt;</em></tt>,
	      or more elegantly by pointing and clicking at a
	      visualization tool like
	      "<tt>gitk origin/1.0-branch</tt>".
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      As we said before, your "master" branch (or any
	      branch that you create on your own) is your working
	      area.  You are free to commit to it.  Let's say you
	      start working on a tool to draw straight lines, as any
	      self-respecting enterprise-level paint program will
	      absolutely <em>require</em> a tool to draw straight
	      lines (you may wonder how they ever released 1.0 without
	      such a tool).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      So, you do a few commits.  The first commit creates a
	      new straight-line-tool class.  The second commit
	      registers the tool against the tool manager in the
	      program.  The third commit adds a pretty icon for the
	      toolbar.  Your repository now looks like this, with your
	      three sexy commits marked in hot pink.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Local commits" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-9.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Notice that HEAD didn't change:  it still points to the
	      the "master" ref, as this is still your current branch!
	      However, the "master" ref (the movable ref on wheels)
	      now points to your latest commit.  Meanwhile, the
	      origin's refs have not moved at all, because you haven't
	      done anything that would cause Git to update them
	      (i.e. you have not fetched any new content from the
	      origin repository).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>Fetching, part two</strong>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      While you are mostly done with your straight line tool,
	      you want to keep up with the official line of
	      development.  So you do
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <tt>git fetch origin</tt>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      This tells Git, "bring in any new content from the
	      remote repository called <tt>origin</tt>".  Let's look at
	      pictures of your repository before and after fetching:
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Before and after fetching" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-11.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      What just happened?  Git noticed that there were two new
	      commits in the "master" branch of the origin repository.
	      Our local name for that branch is
	      <tt>remotes/origin/master</tt>.  Notice that this
	      ref-on-wheels moved to point to the newest of those two
	      commits:  <strong>(4)</strong> is the new tip of the
	      <tt>remotes/origin/master</tt> branch.  Notice that our
	      old <strong>(1)</strong> is still where it was.
	      <strong>(1)</strong> is no longer the tip of any branch;
	      it is a plain old commit in the middle, totally
	      un-special like the middle child of a large family.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      This is the beauty of Git:  when you fetch data from
	      other repositories, Git just hooks the fetched commits
	      to the appropriate places in the graph of commits,
	      <em>but it doesn't fuck with your work</em> (unlike
	      Subversion, where you can't fetch the new code from
	      upstream without risking a conflict-fest in your working
	      copy).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>Merging</strong>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Let's say you use a tool like <tt>gitk --all</tt>
	      to examine what you just fetched, and you are satisfied
	      with the junk that was brought in.  Maybe there are fixes to
	      other parts of the enterprise-level paint program.
	      Let's integrate them into our work!  You do this:
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <tt>git merge origin/master</tt>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      This tells Git, "merge the <tt>origin/master</tt> branch
	      into my current branch".  Again, let's compare the
	      before-and-after states of merging.  Let's assume that
	      there were no conflicts during merging.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Before and after merging" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-12.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Here we see <strong>(5)</strong>, a new commit that was
	      the result of the merge.  Note how it has two parents!
	      Whenever you do a merge, Git records <em>where</em> you
	      merged from — this lets it figure things out
	      properly if you do a merge from the same branches in the
	      future (unlike Subversion, which gives you a
	      conflict-fest in that scenario).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      As usual when doing a commit, Git advanced your "master"
	      ref to point to the new commit, <strong>(5)</strong>.
	      HEAD still points to "master", so new commits will go to
	      your "master" branch as usual.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Note that the pink commits only exist on your machine.
	      You have not pushed them yet to any remote repository.
	      We will see how to do that later.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <strong>Fast-forwards</strong>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Consider a repository where the tip of a remote branch
	      and the tip of a local branch point to the same commit:
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Local and remote refs pointing to the same commit" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-13.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Here, <strong>(6)</strong> is simply the latest commit.
	      Both your "master" ref and the remote's
	      <tt>origin/master</tt> ref point to exactly the same
	      commit — this is as if you had just cloned a
	      repository and so the branches are identical.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Let's say you do "<tt>git fetch origin</tt>"
	      and you end up with something like the following (again,
	      you can visualize this with <tt>gitk --all</tt>):
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Before and after fetching a fast-forward" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-14.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The "fetch" command brought in three new commits,
	      which are colored in light blue.  Note how the remote's
	      <tt>origin/master</tt> ref moved to point to
	      <strong>(7)</strong>, which is the latest commit that
	      got fetched.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      So far so good, right?  We haven't made any local
	      changes; we just brought in newer code from the origin
	      repository.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Now what happens if we do the same merge as before
	      — what if we do "<tt>git merge
	      origin/master</tt>"?  Let's see what happens:
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <img alt="Before and after merging a fast-forward" src="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/misc/git-repo-15.png"/>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Git notices that there is no divergence between
	      <strong>(6)</strong>, the old tip of your master branch,
	      and the string of commits that ends at
	      <strong>(7)</strong>.  So Git just moves your "master"
	      ref forward!  This is just what you expect:  if you
	      haven't made any changes and you just fetch in newer
	      code, merging that code should produce no conflicts at
	      all — you just get the newer code and that's it.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Git calls this situation a <em>fast-forward</em>.
	      Whenever Git tells you that it was able to fast-forward
	      a merge, or that a branch is a certain number of commits
	      behind a fast-forwardable one, this is a <em>good
	      thing</em> — it means that merging right there
	      would be a trivial operation.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      In the next part, we'll see what to do about merge
	      conflicts — that is, when merges are not trivial
	      operations.
	    </p>
	  </li>

However, that required running your own code, which is hardly in the spirit of Web 2.0 and cloud computing and all that. So, now, here’s how to send your posts from Twitter to Identi.ca without running any software yourself.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign into <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a> with your OpenID (Ubuntu users, if you don’t have an OpenID you can use your Launchpad ID: https://launchpad.net/~fred-bloggs )</li>
<li>Say “Create new Twitter feed”</li>
<li>Change it to be a laconi.ca feed</li>
<li>Set the feed URL to be http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=WvUZFt_G3RG6Veiqbbsjiw&amp;_render=rss&amp;twitteruser=<strong>YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME</strong></li>
<li>…and you are done</li>
</ol>
<p>The pipes.yahoo.com stuff is there because if you just use twitterfeed to send your Twitter user RSS feed direct to identi.ca then all your posts have “sil: ” at the beginning (or whatever your username is). The Yahoo pipe strips that off.</p>
<p>If you want to post to Identi.ca and have your posts show up on Twitter<span style="color: red;" title="i.e., the opposite of what I'm describing here">*</span> then Identi.ca does it for you; just set it up in the Settings section of Identi.ca.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve spent this Saturday on reorganizing the structure in <a href="https://bugs.maemo.org">Maemo Bugzilla</a> (this was planned for several weeks). From my point of view, it will make it much easier to add future components/products without cluttering too much. For interested Nokia developers, it should be easier to track bugs (by e.g. adding the virtual QA contact to one’s email watchlist) because the new components fit better to the working areas of internal software teams. For the reporter, it’s hopefully easier because we e.g. gave the Home applets and the Utilities explicitly their own components.<br/>
Making it easier both for bug reporters to find the right product/component <strong>and</strong> for developers to track their components is like trying to square the circle, but I think we have a good compromise here.<br/>
I’ve also introduced a category named “X-Graveyard” which includes the “product” “X-Discontinued”. Stuff that is not shipped/not worked on anymore will end up here - less clutter in queries and products.</p>
<h3>General progress</h3>
<p>The decreasing numbers in <a href="http://www.octofish.net/bugjar/">Stephen’s weekly Bug Jars</a> have already shown the nice progress we’ve been making in cleaning up two years of mostly ignored bug reports, though I must admit that a good part of the reports that were closed are either unfortunately “WONTFIX” or “FIXED for Fremantle, but not in Diablo”. This is not the perfect solution from a Diablo user point of view (and has led to <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25228">some discussions and complaints</a>), but I prefer to honestly forward this Nokia feedback (and receive some flames, though I’m not the one making these decisions actually) instead of continuing to just ignore the reports. You too, probably. <img alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley" height="16" src="http://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-raspberry.png" width="16"/> </p>
<div><img alt="Stats showing the Clean up progress" src="http://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/files/2008/12/blog-bmo-progress.png" title="Clean up progress"/></div>
<p>As you know I forward “valuable” reports (good steps to reproduce, tested with the latest public version) to Nokia’s internal bug tracking system, hence it’s interesting for me to see how many reports exist that do not have an internal reference yet. (Development platform bugs are handled in Maemo Bugzilla only so they don’t count here.) You can help reducing that number by taking a <a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/buglist.cgi?classification=Maemo+Official+Applications&amp;classification=Maemo+Official+Platform&amp;product=Browser&amp;product=Chat+and+Internet+Call&amp;product=Connectivity&amp;product=Contacts&amp;product=Core&amp;product=Data&amp;product=Desktop+platform&amp;product=Email&amp;product=Flasher&amp;product=Games&amp;product=Home+applets&amp;product=Images+and+Camera&amp;product=Internet+Tablet+Video+Converter&amp;product=Location&amp;product=Map&amp;product=Media+player&amp;product=Multimedia&amp;product=Real+Time+Communication&amp;product=RSS+feed+reader&amp;product=Settings+and+Maintenance&amp;product=System+software&amp;product=Translations&amp;product=UI+Specification&amp;product=User+guide+%26+Help+content&amp;product=Utilities&amp;keywords_type=nowords&amp;keywords=moreinfo&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_severity=blocker&amp;bug_severity=critical&amp;bug_severity=major&amp;bug_severity=normal&amp;bug_severity=minor&amp;field0-0-0=alias&amp;type0-0-0=notsubstring&amp;value0-0-0=int-">bug report</a> that does not have an internal reference yet, reproducing it with the latest version and adding a comment about this. Even if it’s only one bug - it helps improving Maemo.</p></div>

    <title>Four months in job review</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I've been at my new job for almost four months now. After I had completed my
degree, my advisors at the university quickly offered me a position. When I
heard back e.g. from Google where I had submitted an application, I had already
started my new job.<br/></p><p>So from my current point of view it was the best thing to do:
</p><ul>
<li>Challenge. It's a total brain job, which makes it lots of fun. I'm not
fixing peoples computers or broken PHP hacks, but I'm bending my mind on new
algorithms pushing the limits of science. Before I started I was like
"actually I'd like to make new things work for everybody, get them out
into to wild". But I can be just as happy with getting things work in a
lab context, actually.</li>
<li>Learning. I keep on learning. Not only on the science level, but writing
articles, advising people for their thesis, teaching, ... they all contribute
to personality.</li>
<li>People. The colleagues and my "boss" are fantastic. No infighting,
competitions for certain positions or so.</li>
<li>Little stress. University work is quite regulated, but that also means it
basically is a 9-to-6 job. In internet startups, consulting, IT administration,
etc. you often have irregular working hours, 24h standby and such things.
Here I can reliably plan my evenings (dancing!) and I'm not taking my work
home, but when I'm home all I have to do is relax for the next day. Of course
there is the occasional exception when a conference deadline is coming up.</li>
<li>Reasonable deadlines. Conference deadlines are different than
product deadlines. They're just there, but not pushed in a way to make them
unachievable without overtime.</li>
<li>Payment. It's regulated, so it's not as much as the high tech companies
would pay or I could probably earn freelance, but it's reliable and definitely
enough for me to live on (I don't spend much anyway, I don't have expensive
hobbys. So I end up saving a large share of it.)</li>
<li>Degree. In three years, I should end up with a PhD degree.</li>
<li>Office. The university offices are good, and centrally located. We can
get some good food nearby, have a nice huge park, a Biergarten, ...</li>
</ul>
<p/></div>

    <title>OpenSolaris 2008.11 Network Printers - auto-discovery using snmp</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/presto"> Presto</a> is an effort to fill the printing gaps in Solaris/OpenSolaris. The idea of Presto is to automate the process of locating printers as much as possible. So now with the integration of OpenSolaris Print Manager, we can now:<br/>
</p><ul><br/>
<li> auto-detect local USB printers and prompt user to create queue on a pre-filled dialog when it is first plugged in.<br/>
</li><li> OpenSolaris Print Manager allows user to do more print queues and print jobs operations as I have previously blogged <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/gheet/entry/opensolaris_print_manager"> here</a>.<br/>
</li></ul><br/>
One hidden jewel of Presto which is not available by default after installing OpenSolaris 2008.11 is the auto-discovery of network printers. Due the space constraint of Live CD, one of the package that the auto-discovery of network printer required is omitted from the Live CD, SUNMWsmmgr. To use this feature:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li> Launch Package Manager (a.k.a Add More Software) on the desktop<br/>
</li><li> Search for 'SUNWsmmgr', you should see it is not installed<br/>
</li><li> Click on the check box to its left<br/>
</li><li> Click on Install/Update on the tool bar<br/>
</li></ul><br/>
After installation, you have to restart the following SMF services:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li> svcadm restart hal (the process /usr/lib/hal/hald-addon-network-discovery should be running)<br/>
</li><li> svcadm enable printers:snmp (make sure that this service is started correctly)<br/>
</li></ul><br/>
Launch System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Print Manager, any network printer in your sub-net that talks snmp should be automatically added to the system and appear in the Print Manager. It will take about a minute for that to be shown.<p/>


<p>More on-line documentation about the Print Manager is <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSolarisInfo/Managing+Printing+in+the+Desktop"> here</a></p></div>

<p><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/gman">Glynn</a> has written up a <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/features/whats-new/200811/">good summary of new features</a>, which include <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.24/">GNOME 2.24</a>, ZFS Time Slider, accessible install, and big improvements to <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/presto/">plug’n'play printer support</a>, <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/nwam/">automatic network configuration</a>, and <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/suspend-resume/">laptop suspend/resume</a>.  The number of additional packages available in the repositories has greatly improved since the 2008.05 release, and we now have various repos and a <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/sw-porters/contributing/">new process</a> that will make contributing packages easier than ever.</p>
<p>Roman Strobl has produced a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/observatory/entry/screencast_what_s_new_in">12 minute screencast</a> to show off some of the new bits, and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/erwann">Erwann Chénedé</a> has a shorter one that focuses exclusively on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/erwann/entry/time_slider_screencast">Time Slider</a>, which seems to have been generating a lot of interest.</p>
<p>Of course, 2008.11 still has all the usual Solaris goodness like ZFS, Zones and Dtrace built-in, with the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/security/projects/tx/TX_opensolaris_2008_11/">Solaris Trusted Extensions</a> now just a click away too, giving you access to one of the most secure desktops on the planet*.</p>
<p>So why not give the LiveCD a spin?  You can grab it via <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/torrents/info/osol-0811.iso.torrent">BitTorrent</a>, or <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/osol/opensolaris/2008/11/osol-0811.iso">download the ISO</a> directly from Sun (or alternatively, from the <a href="http://www.genunix.org/distributions/indiana/osol-0811.iso">genunix mirror</a>, or via FTP from <a href="ftp://ftp.df.lth.se/pub/opensolaris/current/">LTH in Sweden</a>).</p>

    <title>why I’m not a big fan of OOo, part 53240</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was asked after the <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2008/11/07/part-two-of-deep-fried-bytes-podcast-up/">Deep Fried Bytes podcast</a> why I said on the podcast that I pretty much like Office 2007’s user experience and hate OOo. I could go on at length, but here is a short version of the most important part of it.</p>
<p>Three full years ago Microsoft shipped a beta build of Office that announced “the office suite’s menus have become so cluttered and badly structured that users find it impossible to locate certain functions.”<sup>1</sup> Their solution, the Ribbon, does a really good job of grouping important functionality together in a discoverable manner, and made it very easy for me to go from zero (prior to this year, I had not really used Office since 1998, and was far from a power user at that time) to relative power user (which I’ve had to be for various school tasks this year) in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Contrast with OOo, which has suffered from the same menu and functionality problem for nearly as long as Office has. OOo has <a href="http://www.heise-online.co.uk/news/OpenOffice-s-UI-will-be-getting-a-refurb--/112130">finally started thinking about the problem</a>, <em>three years</em> after Microsoft had already thought about it long enough to propose a pretty darn good solution. In the meantime, accessing OOo’s basic functionality is usually clunky at best, painful in many cases, and impossible for mere mortals at worst.</p>
<p>OOo 3.0 takes significant steps in the right direction in terms of speed and feature quality<sup>2</sup>, and I’m very excited to hear that the OOo folks are going to take the important step of doing automated collection of menu and feature usage data- an important step that many free software projects should consider taking. I certainly wish them the best of luck in coming up with a solution and implementing it; I will always use it when I have the choice. But in the meantime, for those who haven’t used it- rest assured that unlike Win98-&gt;Vista, Office98-&gt;Office07 is a huge jump in usability and quality- one that OOo has only begun preparing to follow.</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li class="footnote" id="footnote_0_1403">to quote Heise’s description of the same problem in other software.</li><li class="footnote" id="footnote_1_1403">though it is still in my experience slower, buggier, and more crash-prone than Office 2007</li></ol></div>

    <title>CodeCollaborator “Competitive Analysis”</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Now, I've never really felt like <a href="http://www.review-board.org/">ReviewBoard</a> was competing with Smart Bear Software's <a href="http://smartbear.com/codecollab.php">Code Collaborator</a>. I'm sure they see it that way, but it doesn't have any bearing on the way we've run the project. We're not concerned about feature checklists or keeping parity; we've been trying to make Review Board be the best tool we can for us, and all of our contributors have been doing the same. Comparisons to other tools rarely factor into the equation, since we don't have a lot invested in whether people choose us or another. The way I view it, any sort of code review tool is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>That said, this <a href="http://smartbear.com/codecollab-compare.php?compare2=rvboard">competitive analysis</a> published on their web site had me giggling. The sheer amount of FUD and outright lies is staggering. My favorite bit is how Review Board doesn't support pre-commit reviews for Perforce (which was the <em>first</em> thing it supported).</p></div>

<p>Woke up, left, took the Bolt bus back to NYC. Went to SoHo, had pizza at Ben’s pizza, supposedly the best pizza in New York.  Went to the Apple store, as usual it looked nice but low on content.</p>
<p>Went for cheesecake at Eileen’s, Kristien bought some SoHo boots.  Went to pick up our bags at the previous hotel to move to our new hosted bed and breakfast.</p>
<p>Went out for dinner at the Fork and Knife, 6 course sampler menu. Afterwards, tried to get into the Greenhouse, but it was invite only. Instead, ended up at the Bitter End on Houston (which isn’t pronounced as you think), which had a pretty good band called Jason Yudoff and the New Hotness. Awesome guitar player, and a horns section.</p>
<p>day 8</p>
<p>Woke up late, went out to Central Park.  Convinced the bike rental guy that, no, subzero is not a problem for us to rent a bike and go biking around the park, and yes, we understood that it would be 9$ even if we brought the bike<br/>
back after 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Went for a burger at the Burger Joint in Park Meridien hotel, awesome burger, worth the 30 minute queue.  Tried to go to FAO Schwarz, but there was a queue of over 300 people.  Went back to the apartment to meet Ingrid.</p>
<p>Went to Rockefeller Center and up to the observatory deck, an awesome night view of NYC.  Went to the East Village, passed by Caracas Arepas on the way for a yummy Reina Pepiada and a beef arepa.</p>
<p>Passed by St Marks comics - a comics store that is open until 1 AM ! Planned to come back there after the show.</p>
<p>Walked down to the Bowery Ballroom, we were late but so was the first opening band.  Second opener, <a href="http://www.deltaspirit.net/">Delta Spirit</a>, was awesome - best unknown opening band I’ve seen in 15 years, since Kitchens of Distinction.  They blend an edgy Gomez and Walkmen with a distinct southern flavor.  <a href="http://www.nadasurf.com/">Nada Surf</a> was excellent, which was less of a surprise.  They played to a home town and played quite a few old songs, including their first single.</p>
<p>Afterwards all bands were very approachable, walking around and talking to people at the bar.  Matthew Caws looks just like his mother, funny to see. Of course the show ended close to 1, so no more going back for comics.</p>
<p>day 9</p>
<p>Got up, got a lovely New York breakfast from our host, Ingrid.  Went to the MOMA where we were on the guest list thanks to Lucille, our host at last week’s milonga.  While smaller than I expected, it was still an impressive museum, and our staff guest tickets got us into the special Van Gogh exhibit easily.  Most of all impressed with the design exhibition.</p>
<p>After MOMA, went to B&amp;H to buy the Cowon A3 player I had set my mind to, while Kristien went boots shopping.  She arrived in New York with two pairs and left the city with five.</p>
<p>Went to Grand Central Terminal to pick up a cool t-shirt that should have been there by now but still wasn’t, ate down at the food court, then took our last metro ride back to Ingrid’s.  Had some trouble convincing a cab driver to take us to the airport (apparently due to shift changes), stressed about the traffic, but arrived well in time for our flight.</p>
<p>I’ve taken a few plane rides, but a night time take off from New York is a truly awesome sight to behold once you’ve walked through its streets.</p>
<p>The personal in-flight entertainment makes for a romantic experience when we count down together pushing ‘play’ on the same show we’re going to watch.</p>
<p>Goodbye New York.  Hope to see you back soon.</p></div>

    <title>Career advice</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If all goes well, I should be getting my Master in Computer Science diploma next July.  This means I've been keeping my eyes open for interesting job opportunities the last few months, especially the last two days, when I was at <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/">Devoxx</a>.<br/>
<br/>
From this small survey, I've noticed a few things:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Most jobs available are of the consultant kind: either it's installing and configuring existing software, or developing custom business software for specific companies. Or it implies architecting solutions composing of these existing pieces of software, without writing a single line of code.</li>
<li>Open source jobs usually imply working from home, which unfortunately also means no direct face-to-face colleagues. Something which doesn't look too appealing at this point in my life.</li>
<li>Also, I often have the feeling that they are coding-jobs for life. I love programming now (that is actually an understatement), but I'm not sure if I'd like to do it forever, having some possible carreer path would be nice.</li>
<li>If you like to work on product software (as opposed to custom business software), most of the action is going on in the US (Google, IBM, Sun and most big Linux companies), the UK (Canonical) or Germany (part of Novell) [1].</li>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This basically leaves me wondering:<br/>
<br/>
What kind of jobs are there:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>That involve projects that are useable in more than one installation, this doesn't have to be open [2], but it would be nice if it were a product, rather than a one-off custom brew.</li>
<li>That allow me to stay in Belgium. I have very good personal reasons to stay in this country, for now.</li>
<li>In which I have face-to-face colleagues. I do not like running a one man office where I can 't meet new people.</li>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Are my fears correct in the sense that finding a job like this will be quite impossible here in Belgium? Or are my impressions totally wrong? Comments welcome, as I have increasingly less of an idea what I want to do when I graduate.<br/>
<br/>
[1] <em>This might not be completely correct, as I'm no expert on the exact locations of all the offices of all these companies.</em><br/>
[2] <em>But off-course, anything that is related to the open-source world is the way of the future, the whole proprietary ecosystem feels so... inefficient.</em></div>

One thing we’ve taken very seriously in OpenSolaris is the opportunity of getting our software <b>everywhere</b>. That’s why we started the free media shipping program, and made our install image 100% re-distributable. There’s nothing new here, and other communities get the credit for coming up with the idea first. But it makes so much sense in today’s world, reaching out to new communities that we would not have reached previously.
</p>
<p>
A number of people stepped forward to mirror the OpenSolaris 2008.05 ISO install image. Thank you, thank you! - If any of you ever get to NZ, I’d buy you a beer in an instant. Now we’d like to ask you to do this again with the upcoming OpenSolaris 2008.11 release, and the following rsync instructions -</p>
<blockquote><pre>  rsync -avz pkg.opensolaris.org::osol_release_isos .
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The total disk requirements to mirror the ISO images is about 14GB at the moment, which includes 2008.05. We are restricted by 4 concurrent connections, but we can bump this up if there’s enough demand. If you do mirror, drop me a <a href="mailto:glynn.foster@sun.com">mail</a>, so I can make sure to list you on <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/get/">www.opensolaris.com/get</a>.
</p>
<p>
More details about mirroring the package repository itself coming soon. Thanks due to <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sch">Stephen</a> and his <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg">team</a> for getting this set up.</p></div>

    <title>RubyGems doesn't have to be a call to arms</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://np237.livejournal.com/21033.html">Joss</a>, <a href="http://www.grep.be/blog/en/computer/cluebat/rails_followup">Wouter</a>, and <a href="http://gwolf.org/node/1872">Gunnar</a>:</p>

<p>In my book, <a href="http://jasondclinton.livejournal.com/69579.html">Ruby Phrasebook</a>, I spent some time thinking about how much I hate RubyGems for the same reasons that you all do and--for the chapter on Ruby packaging--I settled on a nice compromise that both makes it easy to package a Ruby module and makes it compatible with RubyGems, as well.</p>

<p>Here is a small sample code snippet from the Packaging chapter:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Packaging Your Module with Hoe</strong>
<pre>$ sudo gem install hoe
...
$ sow rsssimple
$ mv -f rsssimple.rb rsssimple/lib/
$ cd rsssimple
$ $(EDITOR) README.txt
$ $(EDITOR) Rakefile
$ rake package</pre>

<p>The preceding sequence of commands will take you from zero to fully packaged. However, before running the final command you need to do a little house-keeping. Before running rake, modify the Rakefile to resemble the following:</p>

<pre># -*- ruby -*- 

require 'rubygems' 
require 'hoe' 
require './lib/rsssimple.rb' 

Hoe.new('rsssimple', RSSSimple::VERSION) do |p| 
  p.developer('Jason Clinton', 
    'me@jasonclinton.com' ) 
  p.summary = 'Not intended for production.' 
end 

# vim: syntax=Ruby </pre>

<p>The preceding set of actions results in the generation of a pkg directory containing both a tarball and a gem file.</p>

<p>Explore what other commands have been magically created for you by running the following command:</p>

<pre>rake -T</pre>

    <title>Dear Lazyweb: Multilingual Wordpress static site?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I know that Lazyweb won't be reading this because just like Santa it is simulated by people, but I don't mind much as long as I get an answer.<br/><br/>Do you have experience in building a mostly static - that is not a blog - WordPress site in at least two languages? I'd like to get rid of the three-lingual static HTML on the Kiwi Linux site and use WP but I am not sure which of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">many</span> multilingual plugins for it is the most mature and easiest to install and maintain. The site should have a similar URL structure and layout with only the language code difference in the URL, and all content is written manually, so it is not the automatic translation plugins that I am after.<br/><br/>Any examples of existing multilingual WP sites which are not a hassle to maintain are fine too.<br/><br/>I'd like it to be structured more or less like the <a href="http://kiwilinux.org/en">current site</a>, but easier to modify.<br/><br/>thanks</div>

<p>I’ve been much to silent about Xesam lately, and I shall be the first to admit that we have lost a bit of momentum, however I am confident that we will get back on track. It is my sincere plan to have the 1.0 spec set in stone before Christmas. After that Xesam GLib should begin to pick up steam again.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>Now for the whining, you may skip this part <img alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://www.grillbar.org/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/> I’ve been feeling totally drained of energy lately, not just my hacking mojo, but pretty much in all aspects of life. November more or less felt like a series of events just passing by my apathic eyes. I am not really sure what hit me, but I am determined not to let it stay that way and the energies are beginning to reappear - I even took the dog for a jog tonight - and it was cold and rainy (standard danish weather)!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m determined to actually finish blogging about our wedding and honeymoon.  <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shaunm/2008/09/01/honeymoon-uno-buenos-aires/">Last time</a>, I blogged about the first leg of our honeymoon in Buenos Aires.  After Buenos Aires, we flew to Puerto Iguazú, the city on the Argentinian side of the Iguaçu falls.  We took a shuttle over to the Brazilian side and stayed in the magnificant Hotel Das Cataratas inside the Iguaçu National Park.  Here’s a shot of the hotel and the falls from the plane:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/4#img_5452.jpg"><img alt="" height="450" src="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/files/2008-07-27_Iguacu/medium/img_5452.jpg" width="600"/></a></p>
<p>We stayed two nights at the falls, enjoying the breathtaking scenery.  Silke got pretty sick the first night, but after that, we were able to get some relaxation between the more active legs of our trip.  I swear, every picture you take there is a postcard.  It’s just so beautiful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/4#img_5516.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/files/2008-07-27_Iguacu/medium/img_5516.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On the second day, we took the <a href="http://www.packtours.se/dest/parana/igu/tour/macucosafari/index.htm">Macuco tour</a>.  They take you in a trailer behind an electric jeep through the forest, stopping to give informational tidbits along the way.  Then you get out of the trailer and walk for a bit on some trails down to the river past the base of the falls.  The hike takes you through some marvelous scenery.</p>
<p>Then the fun begins.  They put you in a small boat and head upstream toward the falls.  They don’t avoid the rapids.  In fact, I’m pretty sure they try their best to hit them.  As you approach the falls, they stop and let you take some pictures from the bottom.  Then they run you under the falls.</p>
<p>Seriously, under the falls.  I had cold water pouring over my head.  I was completely soaked.  And after thoroughly drenching us, they slammed into the rapids on the way back downstream in a way that made a wall of water come over the boat.  It was a blast.  (We didn’t take our camera for the tour, opting to just live in the moment.  So I have no pics.  Sorry.)</p>
<p>This is where we had breakfast in the morning:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/4#img_5496.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/files/2008-07-27_Iguacu/medium/img_5496.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see the falls from the terrace of the hotel.  The Iguaçu falls are just magnificent.  Surely the most beautiful place on Earth I’ve ever seen.  And the hotel is right up against them, surrounded by nature.  I highly recommend staying there to anybody who’s planning a visit.</p>
<p>As always, check out the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/lovessilke/gallery/4">entire gallery</a> for more pictures.</p></div>

Did an incredibly disappointing NBC studio tour (advertised as 70 minutes, started with a 15 minute overview video, then a behind-the-glass look at the SNL sets, a make-up video, and then a fake news show with two<br/>
people from the tour, and that was it.)</p>
<p>Went to see the New York Knicks play the Portland Trailblazers.  Knicks lost, but still very entertaining.  They really keep you busy at every time out or break.</p>
<p>day 5</p>
<p>Got up, went out for breakfast, 2 eggs on a platter with bacon.  Went to Brooklyn Bridge, walked across, clear blue sky, great view.  Went to Coney Island, mostly closed.  Faded glory.  Had Nathan’s hot dog and corn on a cob, not impressed.  Walked along the boardwalk to Brighton Beach into Little<br/>
Odessa.  Had Borscht and meat with buckwheat at a Russian restaurant, interesting.</p>
<p>Back into town, shopped a little, then went to Momofuku to meat up with <a href="http://tieguy.org/">Luis</a> and Krissa.  Had a nice dinner, fresh food, good ice cream.  Went to a bar and scored the best cocktail, called ‘Tie me up to the bed post’, which had a twig of rosemary skewering some cranberries as decoration.</p>
<p>day 6</p>
<p>Up and out, leave our bags in the bag storage room for the next two days, and take a cab to the Tick Tock diner to catch the bolt bus to Boston. Had blueberry and raisin/walnut pancakes with maple syrup for breakfast. The Bolt bus is nice, clean, and has electricity and wireless.</p>
<p>Got off in Boston South and met up with Ward, April and Ruth.  Dropped off our stuff at the Free Software Foundation headquarters where Ward works.  Had a Chili-style steak sandwich, walked around Boston Commons, the Garden, Beacon Heights, and down Newbury (why can’t I pass by a comics store without buying anything ?), then took the bus into Harvard where sadly the skating rink was closed.</p>
<p>Back home to Somerville, then out to Davis Square for dinner at Johnny D’s (good food, but the live band was pretty bad, the waiter begged us to ‘please take me out with you guys’), and then on for drinks at the Diva Lounge.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I have created a new <a href="http://laptop.org/">OLPC XO</a> <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities">activity</a> called the RetroScope.  It shows you live video, but with a zero to 10 second delay.
