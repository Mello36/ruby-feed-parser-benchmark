			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of you following <a href="https://www.mytrade.com/andyswan">my mytrade</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andyswan">twitter</a> feeds should have had an amazing week in the market.  With the market set to step of the ledge tomorrow, my FAZ trade will end the week in legendary position, up from an entry in the 38&#8217;s on Monday to a likely mid to high 50&#8217;s tomorrow.  Just a beautiful week to go against the grain at the right time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/jana_for_really">Jana_for_Really</a> is worth a follow for the comedy, fun crudeness and a great nose for the market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/upsidetrader">UpsideTrader</a> is probably the best intraday guy on twitter on a consistent basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mytrade.com/tarigal">Lucas Tarigal</a> is giving amazing setups and analysis over at mytrade.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibankcoin.com/flyblog/">&#8220;The Fly&#8221;</a> is best to start following when he&#8217;s down and angry&#8230;because he always wins in the end and is probably one of the best 3 traders I have ever seen.</p>
<p>These are the people I&#8217;m watching right now because they are not only &#8220;on&#8221;, but also have a foundation that I trust.  There are tons of others doing amazing stuff in this tough tape so if you know of one just shout it in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stock market took some extremely bad news in stride today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that armageddon is already priced in.</p>
<p>GOOD news could put 10-20% on this market in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>I like buying stocks here and selling call options against the position to generate income, precisely because stocks are low and options are expensive right now.</p>
<p>The economy needs a lot of work and help.  FAILURE of defunct organizations will speed this process up and provide for a more efficient and sustainable future.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop propping up bad ideas, structures, management and employees.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on building new ideas, sound structures, lean management and effective, efficient employees who are passionate about what they are producing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done ALL of this before.  We&#8217;ll do it again, as long as failure is a realistic option and motivator.</p>
<p>What are you thinking?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.  Establish and grow RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Contacts&#8221; are not nearly as valuable as you think. Relationships are the key.  People who trust you and like you are very likely to help you.  In addition, they are very likely to induce their own relationships to help you.</p>
<p>Develop relationships BEFORE you need them.  Do this by GIVING first and freely.  Participate in, and enable the success of others at every opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>2. DEFINE A SINGLE PROBLEM or NICHE OPPORTUNITY and resolve to find a simple solution (IDEA)</strong></p>
<p>This is crucial.  DO NOT spread yourself thin.  Do one thing extraordinarily well that either A) solves a common problem or B) creates a new niche that can be expanded.  It is tempting to attempt more in one broad stroke, but this path leads to failure.</p>
<p>DO NOT rely on having the best and latest technology unless you are willing to run the 100m dash&#8230;.FOREVER.</p>
<p><strong>3. STRUCTURE a business around your idea, with a KILLER TEAM<br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://andyswan.com/blog/?p=101">Read this.</a></p>
<p>Everyone you involve in your project is a part of a team.  CRUCIAL to pick the right people.  This will go back to your relationship group, because there is little room for risk here.  Find great people that are passionate about the space you are entering.  Give them UPSIDE and RISK, and don&#8217;t hire anyone that asks what the hours will be&#8230;.because the answer is &#8220;all of them&#8230;it&#8217;s a startup&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remember&#8230;they are not employees, they are partners.  <strong><em>Align interests.  Align risk.  Align reward.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. ELIMINATE your personal &#8220;outs&#8221; (burn the ships that you would retreat in)</strong></p>
<p>Any option other than success must be taken off the table.  When Cortez sought to defeat the Aztecs, the first thing he did was burn the 11 ships that brought his army to shore and declared that retreat was not just unacceptable, but IMPOSSIBLE.  Imagine the difference in thinking that must have transpired&#8230;.from &#8220;let&#8217;s see what these Aztecs are all about&#8221; to &#8220;we must win&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having &#8220;something to fall back on&#8221; increases the odds that you will &#8220;fall back&#8221; by multiples.  Instead, make sure that it will be painful to fail, and therefore that you will do everything in your power not to fail.</p>
<p>In addition&#8230;does having &#8220;something to fall back on&#8221; make your relationship group more or less likely to invest in you?  Exactly&#8230;everyone wants to invest in someone that feels the pain of a zero more than they will!</p>
<p><strong>5. COLLABORATE with relationship group, don&#8217;t present to strangers</strong></p>
<p>When you present an idea to strangers, they always look for ways to shoot holes in it.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s door to door cleaning solution or a startup investment opportunity&#8230;.my first reaction will be to try to find fault with your claims!</p>
<p>On the other hand, people with whom you have an established relationship are likely to desire to help you.  Allow them to PARTICIPATE and collaborate in the process.  Get them mentally invested way before you ask them to pull out the checkbook.  This is a win-win, as it insures the entrepreneur and the investor are both in the project for the same reasons, with the same expectations and fully aligned interests.</p>
<p><strong>6. PERSIST in the face of temporary defeats</strong></p>
<p>Understand that there will be setbacks.  BIG BIG BIG setbacks.  <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/">Read this</a>.  Then read it again.  Oh, and remember&#8230;.your ships are burned, so it would be a really really bad idea to quit now <img src='http://andyswan.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>7. LISTEN to your customers and partners</strong></p>
<p>Your customers and partners are the lifeblood of your business.  Take what they say to heart.  DO NOT EVER tell them that their feedback is wrong, unless it is a customer or partner that you want to fire on the spot.  If you give them an open line to tell you how to make your product/service more beneficial, they will do it, and both of you will benefit.</p>
<p><strong>8. BE YOURSELF</strong></p>
<p>When I see an entrepreneur in a suit, the first thing I think is &#8220;I wonder what else he is dressing up&#8221;.  Again, this is about forming RELATIONSHIPS, which you can&#8217;t fake your way through.  People invest in people more than they invest in ideas (which are a dime a dozen).   They want to be sure they know what they are investing in&#8230;.and since that is YOU, it pays to be up front about this from the start.</p>
<p>If there is something you don&#8217;t like about yourself, fix it!</p>
<p><strong>9.  ALWAYS MAKE MONEY FOR YOUR PARTNERS!!!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t squeeze anyone.  Make other people rich.  <em><strong>Align interests</strong></em> and move on.  You remember why Hyman Roth lived to such an old age in Godfather, right?</p>
<p>Hardball negotiators are rarely worked with a second time, and only invite further conflict down the road when the numbers are more meaningful.</p>
<p>You will become very wealthy by consistantly adding to the riches of others.</p>
<p>This one comes naturally if you are dealing with established relationships.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> _____________________________</p>
<p>Never think you know it all.  Always always be learning.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now is a good time to start a company that sells directly to the consumer.</p>
<p>You need to learn how to make your product so valuable that people will buy it even when they are cutting back on other things.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a market environment where people are unwilling to buy products/services that bring real value to their lives.</p>
<p>Stay lean and learn to sell to lean customers.  You&#8217;ll build a business that lasts a lifetime by sticking to the principles that you learn during tough times like this.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to raise a ton of money&#8230;or even any money.  Just make your first customer a profitable customer.  We did this when we started <a href="http://www.daytradeteam.com">DaytradeTeam</a> in the winter of 2000 (as market continued its post-bubble crash).   Literally, we started the company with around $200 put onto a credit card and got our first customer THAT NIGHT, who paid $250 for the service.</p>
<p>In addition, he did very well and was a long-lasting member&#8230;.. because we valued him so much&#8230;.another good lesson in starting LEAN LEAN LEAN.</p>
<p>Believe me, if we figured out how to make the first customer profitable in the dead winter of 2000, you can too.  There will be time and opportunity to lever-up later.  Don&#8217;t let a <a href="http://andyswan.com/blog/?p=116">lack of enthusiasm for angel investing</a> stop you from STARTING.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, let&#8217;s face it.  Paulson himself did not know more <a href="http://andyswan.com/blog/?p=118">than I did about how the Citi deal would go down</a> and how C shareholders would be rewarded&#8230;.which is why <a href="http://twitter.com/AndySwan/statuses/1017090642">I loaded up on the stock Friday afternoon.</a></p>
<p>How did I know this?  Simple&#8230;<strong>the SHORT trade was waaaaay too crowded with idiots.</strong> Reading through twitters and yahoo message boards, it was CLEAR to me that short-sellers were 100% convinced that there were only two options:</p>
<p>1.  No intervention by government, stock continues to slide to 0</p>
<p>2.  Intervention by government in the exact same way as AIG or FNM/FRE and stock opens significantly lower diluted.</p>
<p><em>So basically, the only possible results they were seeing BOTH went their way.</em> Complete refusal to see alternate scenarios develop.  Anytime you see retail hacks speaking of a free-market trade as riskless, you can count on the exact opposite occuring.  EVERY TIME.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, the Government had to draw a line in the sand with respect to equity holders.  If C had been taken down in the same manner as AIG, etc&#8230;.you could count on 3 more big banks being attacked by shorts and liquidated by fearful funds, essentially creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure and resulting in a banking system 100% owned by the US government.</p>
<p>Instead, the feds intelligently did the opposite and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of success.  <em>By coming with such a HUGE backstop, they made it much less likely that a backstop would be needed AT ALL</em>.  THAT is what the TARP was designed to do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still LEVERED long in financials (via SWIM, IBNK, C) <a href="http://andyswan.com/blog/?p=110">and gold</a> (via double-long DGP ) with significant cushions on each.  I will pull down my leverage to less glutonous levels on further pops.</p>
<p>My plan is to DO LESS and let these positions ride for quite a while. If I take any new position, it would have to be a short on GOOG, which is going out of its own way to pull a Buckner, letting a 10% market rally roll through its legs without so much as an uptick.</p>
<p>From this point forward, I will lighten up and raise cash on dow +200 or more days, and add to positions on DOW -300 days&#8230;.at the end of the day for each scenario (late day extensions are more likely than reversals in this environment).</p>
