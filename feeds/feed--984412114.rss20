			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does &#8220;Multi-Locality&#8221; mean for the manager of a team in the modern, multi-local environment? According to Josh Bersin “driving a performance-oriented culture demands a focus on new compensation models, improved forms of collaboration, and the development of clear goals-based performance management processes.”  How does this apply to the multi-local talentforce?</p>
<p>First, we need to build <em><strong>personal accountability </strong></em>not only for individual performance, but also for effectiveness in collaborating across a diverse, multi-local environment, working seamlessly in a multi-functional, multi-organizational, multi-generational, and multi-cultural workplace.  We must “inspect what we expect” by leveraging Web-based tools, such as wikis, Web meetings, CRM (customer relationship management) software, instant messaging, and social software to stay connected with the global, digital and virtual workforce.</p>
<p>Second, we need to develop <strong><em>management agility</em></strong>, broadening our management practices and developing more multi-faceted and situational leadership skills.  Traditional practices such as MBWA – management by wandering around  – are still valid and effective in the on-premise environment; yet modern practices, let’s call it MBSA – “management by surfing around” – the ability to lead using modern, Internet-enabled technologies – become paramount in the off-premise world.</p>
<p>Third, we must foster <em><strong>social responsibility</strong></em>, where each individual works toward the organization’s goals to the best of his or her abilities, while respecting and valuing the contribution of others.  In the multi-local environment, diversity is no longer a program managed by the HR department; rather diverse work groups embracing differences in gender, age, culture, nationality, personality,  and religious, political, and sexual preference are the norm in the evolving global village.</p>
<p>Finally, we must develop <em><strong>pay-for-performance</strong></em> strategies in which compensation is tied not only to individual performance but also to effective collaboration in the multi-local environment.  Team-based pay structures and compensation for contributions to group knowledgebases help to direct and motivate individuals in sharing and disseminating knowledge across the global organization.</p>
<p>Mastery of modern organizational models and management practices is a critical success factor for effectiveness in leading the modern, multi-local talentforce.  Management agility, personal accountability, social responsibility, and pay-for-performance are key themes that leaders must embrace to be successful in working with the multi-locality aspects of today’s organizations.  Whether you are a corporate executive, regional manager, outsourcer, expatriate, or inexorable road warrior, there are a plethora of tools and options now available to improve communication and foster collaboration in supporting work anyplace, anytime, anyhow, helping individuals find greater work/life balance in the modern global, digital, remote, and evermore virtual world in which we now live.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Communication is the focal point for all successful interaction within and across organizations. As communication tools and technologies have evolved over the decades, the nature and expectations of the workforce have changed. The figure below shows a collection of sites, services, methods, and technologies mapped along the axes of Location and Collaboration.</p>
<p><img title="Multi-Locality and Communication Tools" alt="Multi-Locality and Communication Tools" src="http://www.jeitosa.com/website_images/25/MulitDimensional_Talentforce_-_Part_3_Multi-Locality_GRAPHIC3.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the lower half of the graphic are the traditional, tangible methods of communication, such as company directories, manuals, newsletters, meetings, conferences, as well as the company picnic, hallway discussions, and informal chatter around the water cooler. The collaboration and communication technologies shown in the top half of the figure have grown out of the digital age:  in the upper left are those referred to as Web 1.0 and in the upper right are what have collectively been called Web 2.0.</p>
<p>The term Web 1.0 is a “retronym” – a term developed after the creation of the term Web 2.0 in order to refer to the previous state of the Web.  Web 1.0 can be generally characterized by the development of static websites with read-only material, widespread computer illiteracy, and slow Internet connections. Some examples of websites that have evolved from the Web 1.0 era are Yahoo! and Amazon.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, “Web 2.0 describes the changing trends in the use of World Wide Web technology and web design that aim to enhance creativity, communications, secure information sharing, collaboration and functionality of the web. Web 2.0 concepts have led to the development and evolution of web culture communities and hosted services, such as social-networking sites, video sharing sites, wikis, blogs, and folksonomies.”  The main difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 is that of programmer-generated content versus user-generated content, hence Web 2.0 places a heavy focus on ease-of-use so that users can easily contribute content on a real-time basis.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 technologies cover a broad spectrum of websites, services, methods, and tools such as the following:</p>
<p><em><strong>Online Marketplace</strong></em> – where buyers and sellers collaborate over offers and purchases, such as pioneer eBay, and later Amazon, Craigslist, Angieslist, and now all major retailers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mass Communication Tools</strong></em> – where workers communicate freely in a subscription-based or ad hoc approach, such as RSS feeds, readers, blogs, podcasts, videocasts, YouTube, Flickr.</p>
<p><em><strong>Instant Messaging</strong></em> – tools that facilitate remote collaboration over the Web through real-time messaging, such as trailblazer ICQ and now Yahoo, AIM, MSN, Google Talk, and Skype.</p>
<p><em><strong>Social Software</strong></em> – where users network and communicate with others of similar interests, such as MySpace, Facebook, Linked-In, Plaxo, Orkut, Xing, Ning, SelectMinds, and many others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Collaborative Documentation or wikis</strong></em> – where people contribute knowledge to build a common database, such as pioneer Wikipedia, and others such as Answers, Google Docs, Jive, SocialText, Confluence, and Basecamp.</p>
<p><em><strong>Web Meetings</strong></em> – screen sharing, audio, and video via the Web allowing users to conduct virtual meetings and collaboration sessions, with such products as WebEx, GoToMeeting, and Dimdim.</p>
<p><em><strong>VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)</strong></em> – a method for transmitting voice over the Web enabling real-time conversations, such as Skype, Vonage, and MagicJack.</p>
<p><em><strong>Web Development Software</strong></em> – collaborative Web 2.0 programming languages and tools that improve the user experience, such as Ruby on Rails, Drupal, Ajax, Flash, Dreamweaver, etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tags and Social Bookmarking </strong></em>– a framework for storing, organizing, searching, and managing websites via metadata and making information publically available to others, such as Delicious and Google Bookmarks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Smart phones</strong></em> – Web-enabled, multi-function cellular telephones, incorporating telephony, calendaring, Web surfing, music/video, and gaming, such as the iPhone, Blackberry and Palm Treo.</p>
<p><em><strong>Status Updates</strong></em> – tools that that facilitate staying touch with friends and colleagues, such as SMS (Short Message Service) commonly known as text messaging, as well as microblogging tools like Dodgeball and Twitter.</p>
<p><em><strong>Crowdsourcing or Community-based Design</strong></em> – taking an activity generally performed inhouse and outsourcing it to a large group of undefined people to enhance work and innovation, such as vendors using potential customers to help design new products.</p>
<p><em><strong>Virtual Reality Software</strong></em> – software that simulates another world that can be used to create more effective, life-like training scenarios, such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Effective leadership of the modern, multi-local workforce requires agility and mastery of skills along many dimensions, from informal chats to networking approaches to formal meetings and written documentation. The figure below summaries key communication strategies common for each of the four groups of workers making up today’s talentforce:  local, remote, digital, and virtual.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As work has spread to multi-localities, the nature of and methods for collaboration and team work have also changed.  Collaboration in the traditional, single office setting is vastly different from collaboration across a modern, global, multi-local organization. Work performed on-premise at Corporate and Regional Headquarters locations is largely of a tangible, physical nature in contrast to work done off-premise in Satellite Offices and Offshore Centers which requires more intangible and virtual cooperation. The figure below shows how work across the continua of Location and Collaboration can be grouped into four broad categories.</p>
<p><img alt="Multi-Locality and Collaboration" title="Multi-Locality and Collaboration" src="http://www.jeitosa.com/website_images/24/MulitDimensional_Talentforce_-_Part_3_Multi-Locality_GRAPHIC2.jpg" /><br />
<em><strong>Local – On-premise and Tangible</strong></em> – Collaboration in the local setting is personal and visible. Meetings take place face-to-face, and teamwork (or the lack thereof) is real and apparent. Individuals bond easily in tight-knit groups, sharing a common history and company culture. Much communication takes place in face-to-face meetings and conferences, as well as in hallways, lunch rooms, and around the water cooler.</p>
<p><em><strong>Remote – Off-premise and Tangible</strong></em> – Collaboration in the remote setting is also personal, but disconnected and therefore much less visible. Telephones (land and cellular) and conference calls facilitate communication and collaboration tying remote locations and offsite workers to corporate and regional offices.</p>
<p><em><strong>Digital – On-premise and Intangible </strong></em>– Digital collaboration grew out of the computer era, leveraging the Internet, LAN/WAN technologies, and electronic media such as intranets, email and PowerPoint.  Communication in the digital era has shifted to the Internet with email, websites, online newsletters, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, and so on.  Virtual –</p>
<p><em><strong>Off-premise and Intangible</strong></em> – Virtual collaboration takes the digital age one step further by removing the constraints on time and allowing individuals to work not only anywhere, but anytime – separate time zones but connected via tools and software such as wikis, blogs, social networking software, and more.</p>
<p>My next post will explore in more detail the communication and collaboration tools and technologies that have evolved over the last decade to support and connect the global, disparate, multi-local workforce.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The broadest dimension of the multi-local workforce is whether work is performed on-premise (or onsite) versus off-premise (or offsite).  Traditionally, work was performed on-premise, within the four walls of the organization and under the direct supervision of a watchful manager.  With the growth of the Internet and the advent of the modern, digital age, it is now possible for people and teams to work effectively off-premise, and hence the amount of offsite work has been increasing steadily year after year.  From offsite processing and offshore service centers to application service provider (ASP) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models, work and location are becoming increasingly disassociated.  It is now commonplace for managers to be located in different offices – even different continents – from their teams and for team members to be dispersed across distant geographies and multiple time zones.</p>
<p>The figure below depicts the cross-section of two continua:  one continuum of Location from on-premise to off-premise and the second continuum of Collaboration from tangible to intangible.  Tangible is defined as “discernible by the touch; real or concrete; possible to understand or realize.”  Intangible is something that is “incapable of being perceived by the senses, of being realized or defined; incorporeal.”  In the modern Internet age, intangible work comprises the increasing number of activities that are done online, real-time, dispersed, and disconnected across space and time.</p>
<p><img alt="Multi-Locality" title="Multi-Locality" src="http://www.jeitosa.com/website_images/23/MulitDimensional_Talentforce_-_Part_3_Multi-Locality_GRAPHIC1.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the lower left quadrant, there are Corporate and Regional Headquarters, where people work in groups and teams, physically onsite and generally through face-to-face collaboration. Moving toward the off-premise dimension are the company’s Satellite offices and Offshore Centers, including third-party outsourcers.  Finally, the most remote and most detached workers in the organization are the Road Warriors – those individuals who constantly shuffle from site to site.  They can be the glue that ties diverse groups across the organization together or they can be isolated, disconnected from the main happenings in the company.</p>
<p><em><strong>Corporate Headquarters </strong></em>– Individuals located at Corporate Headquarters work in tightly knit groups, generally co-located in the same building (and hence the same time zone), using the same support infrastructure and tools (e.g., telephone systems, desktop computers, LAN/intranet) and sharing a common company culture (e.g., team outings, lunch presentations, company picnics).</p>
<p><strong><em>Regional Headquarters</em></strong> – Depending on the size of the organization, individuals at Regional Offices work much like those at Corporate Headquarters, co-located in the same building, using the same infrastructure and tools. Effective collaboration between Corporate and the Regions is influenced by the geographical distances and cultural differences and by the standards and commonality (or lack thereof) in the products, processes, methods, infrastructure, and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Satellite Offices</em></strong> – Often located in remote locations and generally separated from Corporate and Regional Headquarters by multiple time zones, large geographical distances, and differing tools and infrastructure, collaboration between individuals located in Satellite Offices and those in other parts of the organization can be challenging.  Beyond technological and infrastructure issues, company (and/or national) culture and organizational barriers influence effective collaboration across such vast location differences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Centers</em></strong> – Offshore operations and third-party outsourcers present yet another step along the on-premise/off-premise locality continuum, putting even greater demands on intangible collaboration. In additional to geographical and time zone differences, different organizational models, culture, missions, goals, and success metrics can be a challenge to effective cross-organizational collaboration between such disparate entities.</p>
<p><em><strong>Road Warriors</strong></em> – Individuals working from airports and hotel rooms and other remote workers operating from home or single offices represent the most distant group of off-premise workers. Road Warriors deal in the most intangible of all environments, working most of their time in the virtual world, needing to assimilate quickly to the culture and collaboration methods of the different sites they visit. Because they work primarily as individual contributors or as “visitors” within an existing team, this group presents its own unique set of challenges for uniting the workforce and building connectedness, cohesiveness, communication, and collaboration.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much has been written about the many dimensions of today’s modern workforce. From the multi-generational differences with the Veterans, Boomers, Gen X and Gen Y to the pluralities of cultures and variety of global mindsets, the workforce of today is more diverse than ever before.  Another important aspect of the multi-dimensional talentforce in the modern digital age – “multi-locality” – the phenomenon that individuals can and do work anywhere, anytime and anyhow.</p>
<p>The worker of today is no longer bound by space and time, constrained by the nine-to-five work day, confined in rows of cubicles.  While offsite work and telecommuting have been a part of our work environment for many years, the increasing numbers of people working remotely and virtually is fundamentally changing the nature of the modern workplace.  Now, rather than an exception to be dealt with, remote, virtual workers are the norm, and accommodating schedules and time zones differences and providing appropriate tools are now critical aspects of modern work. And this is not only true for professional staff; blue collar work is also offshored and piece-mealed, leveraging part-time, retired, and lower cost workers, so that the company’s workforce is truly spread across the globe.</p>
<p>One critical implication of the multi-locality aspect of our work environment is the blurring of boundaries between professional and personal lives. Not only can work be done anywhere, but also at any time, creating expectations of 24&#215;7 availability and instant response times. These heightened expectations can place increased levels of stress on the modern worker, as they pursue the ever more elusive quest for work/life balance. What we need are new approaches and tools that companies can adopt to better support the modern, virtual worker and to increase management effectiveness in today’s global, digital age.</p>
<p>Subsequent blog posts will look at these differences in locality what impact they have on our ability to collaborate and work effectively across the modern, global organization.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s <em>Jeitocast</em>, Karen Beaman interviews <a href="http://www.jeitosa.com/experts#Alsen_Hsein">Alsen Hsein</a>, Senior China Advisor with Jeitosa Group based in Shanghai.  Alsen has been working in China for the last 40 years, and seen the the legal and regulatory environment change significantly.  The biggest challenge that China will be facing for the coming four to five years is in acquiring and retaining talented and experienced managers.  Current projections are that China needs 75,000 manager level individuals just to fill their current open positions. Alsen talks about some of the strategies that Chinese companies are implementing to help meet their talent challenges.

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The good news is that there are solutions available for these challenges: leadership development, cultural awareness training, change management programs, and global communication plans can help individuals understand and appreciate cultural differences and provide tools and techniques for improving cross-cultural collaboration.  Formalized strategies for dealing with data privacy challenges, particularly in dealing with the European Data Privacy Directive, can be developed and include approaches such as Safe Harbor, Model Contracts, and Corporate Binding Rules. </span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt">The top <u>internal</u> challenges companies are facing in going global fall into two major categories: lack of technology and systems to support global initiatives (51%) and lack of experienced and culturally adept resources to work effectively in a global environment – both a lack of global leadership (47%) and a lack of sufficient other global resources (45%).  Going global is a relatively new initiative for many companies, so it is not surprising that many would still be immature in these areas.</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Solutions to these challenges are readily available, but organizations need to step up and realize that building a global infrastructure with global systems and global people takes effort, resources, budget, and time.  More and more vendors are globalizing their product and service offerings making it now possible to source a global solution for HR systems.  With the increased mobility and globalization of the workforce, it is also now possible to find experienced resources who understand first-hand the issues and challenges in designing and deploying a global solution.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt">Working globally, companies are also experiencing some successes.  By far, the greatest success they are finding is in developing and appreciating global diversity (68%).  While this is a challenge for some, it is also a success for others. Generally, the more familiar one culture is with another, the greater the understanding and acceptance of the differences that exist.</span></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much previous research has shown that success in international work is a function of an individual&#8217;s&#8217; “Global Mindset” (<a href="http://www.jeitosa.com/articles">Guy &#038; Beaman 2003, 2005</a>). Peter Senge describes global mindset as &#8220;deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action” (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1211147052&#038;sr=8-1">The Fifth Discipline</a>, 2006). An individual&#8217;s global mindset governs how they perceive things in the world and take action.</p>
<p>The Global Mindset model distinguishes three broad categories of mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ethnocentric Mindsets</strong></em> take the home country as the basis for beliefs and evaluations, holding that their own culture and values are intrinsically superior to those of others, to the point even of assuming national superiority. It might be characterized by the expression: “the sun never sets on the British empire.” This type of mindset is effective when there is a need to standardize operations around the world or to protect the company’s intellectual property.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Polycentric Mindsets </em></strong>are ones that adapt well to cultural differences and are effective at bridging the gap between home and host culture and company objectives. The polycentric mindset entails accommodation or assimilation with the foreign culture, sometimes even to the extent of “going native”. It might be characterized by the expression: “when in Rome do as the Romans.” This type of mindset is appropriate when there is a need for intense focus on the local market or regulatory situation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Geocentric Mindsets</em></strong> are ones that seek universals and commonalities across cultures and are effective at tying diverse groups together toward a common goal. A geocentric orientation implicitly assumes that a universal set of values govern human interaction, downplaying the importance of cultural differences. This mentality can best be summed up by the famous words of John Lennon, “Imagine all the people sharing all the world.” This type of mindset is appropriate for individuals who work at a global level, responsible for integrating the ideas and practices of different businesses and functions into a unified approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different types of mindsets are best suited for different types of international assignments. With respect to international work, <a href="http://chrs.rutgers.edu/publications/">Paula Caligiuri</a> and others have claimed that an individual’s global mindset is directly related to his or her effectiveness depending on the <a href="http://chrs.rutgers.edu/pub_documents/Caligiuri%20&#038;%20Tarique%20Chapter%20-%20Stahl%20and%20Bjorkman%20Book.pdf">nature of the job</a>. In his view, ethnocentric individuals tend to excel in environments that call for significant standardization of methodology or technology, while polycentric individuals thrive in situations that require considerable sensitivity to local conditions, and geocentric individuals excel in positions that require identifying commonalities and integrating different approaches. Hence, the role or job the individual is to perform is vital in determining the type of individual needed for the assignment.</p>
<p>A key role for Global HR is to understand the type of mindset required for each international assignment and to assess individuals to find the best fit based on the person and the job. Nothing can be surer of failure than to select the wrong mindset for the job. Imagine assigning an ethnocentric individual to an intensely local situation. The individual will be frustrated due to a lack of understanding of the environment, and the local team will be irritated at what they see as the arrogance of home office to have sent such a narrow-minded person. Similarly a polycentric individual sent to standardize and protect the interests of home office may be unable to achieve the objectives because of a deep empathy for the local people.</p>
<p>What type of mindset do you have? Do you know what type of mindset each of your international workers and expatriates have? Are you actively managing this aspect of your business?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest challenges in working across cultures is clearly language. It never ceases to amaze me that, in the effort to save some money, companies often choose to do translations of corporate documents in-house using local staff. But translation is a discipline of its own and just because someone speaks the language doesn&#8217;t make them a good translator. In fact, often the opposite is true!</p>
<p>Consider these anecdotes from Gary Ferraro, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Dimension-International-Business-5th/dp/0131927671/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1210556205&#038;sr=8-6">The Cultural Dimensions of International Business</a></em> (2005):</p>
<ul>
<li>An American airline offering service to Brazil advertised its “rendezvous lounges” in its business class section. They failed to realize that the word <em>rendezvous</em> in Portuguese refers to a room for illicit sexual encounters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The American Dairy Association’s successful ad “Got Milk?” was unfortunately translated in Mexico as “Are you lactating?”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An American ink manufacturer attempted to sell bottled ink in Mexico through their advertisement that they could “avoid embarrassment” (from stains) through their brand of ink. However, the Spanish word used for “embarrassed” was “embarazar” (a &#8220;false friend&#8221;) which means to become pregnant. People thought the company was selling a contraceptive device.</li>
</ul>
<p>These very embarrassing situations can easily be avoided through good translation services using native speakers, not someone who learned the language in school. It is only a native speaker who can understand the subtle messages that are being conveyed by the use of one word or phrase over another. And forget automated translation tools, such as Babelfish.  While it&#8217;s a theoretically interesting concept, and many people have been busy for many years in the field of artificial intelligence trying to figure this out, the field of machine translation is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>HR should help the business identify the types of skills needed for different types of activities. For example, the ability to speak the language is clearly important for sales and marketing activities, whereas it is less important for a highly technical positions where the individual will be working with internal staff. Tying competencies and abilities to individual assignments (project-based on regular) &#8212; not just to specific job roles &#8212; is fundamental to working successfully internationally.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://discussionleader.harvardbusiness.org/erickson/">Tammy Erickson</a> has recently posted a couple of interesting blogs about the challenges we&#8217;re currently seeing in the multi-generational workforce.</p>
<p>As we know, Gen X’ers are not thrilled with corporate life. They tend not to trust institutions in general and resent the Boomers’ confident assumptions about life. Here are Erickson’s <a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/erickson/2008/05/ten_reasons_why_the_relationsh.html">10 Reasons by Gen X&#8217;ers are Unhappy at Work</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. X’ers’ corporate careers got off to a slow start.</p>
<p>2. X’ers witnessed adults in their lives being laid off from large corporations.</p>
<p>3. Most corporate career paths “narrow” at the top.</p>
<p>4. The economy started to slow just when they entered the workforce.</p>
<p>5. The pesky Gen Y’s are impossible to manage.</p>
<p>6. X&#8217;ers are surrounded by a love fest between the Boomers and Gen Y&#8217;s.</p>
<p>7. X’ers are the most conservative cohort in today’s workforce.</p>
<p>8. Many X’ers’ are not as comfortable with technology as everyone seems to thinks they are.</p>
<p>9. Boomer colleagues are annoying.</p>
<p>10. Parenting pressures are at a peak.</p></blockquote>
<p>In, <a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/erickson/2008/04/the_boomery_love_fest.html?cm_mmc=npv-_-MGMT_TIP-_-MAY_2008-_-MTOD0516">The Baby Boomer - Generation Y Love Fest</a>, Erickson talks about the challenges and successes with multi-generational mentoring. From her research, she is finding that <a href="http://www.jeitosa.com/blog/2008/05/06/multi-generational-talentforce/">Boomers and New Mils (Gen Y)</a> actually enjoy and mutually benefit from working together. Obviously through their 30+ years of work experience, Boomers have accumulated a lot of experience and want to share their knowledge and pass on their learnings to the future generations. The New Mils are eager to learn and and don&#8217;t feel the need to figure everything out on their own, to prove something to the world. They are thirsting for knowledge, and the Boomers are thriving on giving it!</p>
<p>As a result, Gen X is being squeezed out &#8212; caught in between these two. Of course, the reality is that most Gen X&#8217;ers prefer it this way. They are very independent and not particularly interested in getting involved with mentoring others. They believe they have had to learn things the hard way and so should others. Still, it&#8217;s obvious that some may Gen X&#8217;ers may find themselves in situations where their direct reports are being mentored by their superiors!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &#8220;you can lead a horse to water, but you can&#8217;t make him drink.&#8221; HR should think about various ways to set up and organize mentoring programs, such as pairing Boomers and New Mils together. Trying to force Gen X&#8217;ers to participate in such programs may only force them out the door. Provide options and let people self-select the when, how, and who. The best mentoring occurs with both individuals have opted to work together on their own, rather than when they have been &#8220;assigned a mentor&#8221; by HR.
