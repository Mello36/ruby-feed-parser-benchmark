			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/scott-mccloud-200.png" width="200" height="444" alt="scott_mccloud_200.png" align=right />We are in the extremely early stages of planning <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/2009/sep/">UX Week 2009</a>, our flagship conference on all matters related to user experience design (in fact, we&#8217;re so early, we have almost nothing on that page).</p>
<p>A theme for UX Week 2009 is &#8220;Looking laterally&#8221;, and inviting speakers from fields outside of design who have influenced our work. Someone who has had a huge impact on how I think about design and the creative process is comics creator Scott McCloud, best known for his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=adaptivepat07-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F006097625X%2Fqid%3D1153248298%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Understanding Comics</a></em>, and more recently for the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/features.html?hl=en&amp;brand=CHMI&amp;utm_source=en-et&amp;utm_medium=et&amp;utm_campaign=en">comic explaining Google Chrome</a>.</p>
<p>Scott will present at UX Week 2009, and he was kind enough to chat with me about comics, visual expression, Edward Tufte, and the importance of believing in the message. You can listen to our conversation on Adaptive Path&#8217;s podcast (<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=284362028">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AdaptivePathPodcast">RSS</a>), or <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/media/ap-interview-mccloud_peterme_uxweek2009.mp3">download it directly</a>.</p>
<p>Register for UX Week 2009, or any of our upcoming events, by December 31st, and use the promotion code RNSB and you&#8217;ll get 15% off the current (discounted) registration price.</p>
<p>If you want to get a sense of UX Week 2009 will be like, peruse <a href="http://www.uxweek.com/">the videos from UX Week 2008</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered where your paycheck comes from? I mean, actually comes from? How it’s calculated and tracked? Printed? Deposited? How taxes are paid on it? Chances are, there’s a hardworking soul in your organization who tangles with payroll software on a regular basis — just to pay you!</p>
<p>Last year, we had the privilege of working with a team from <a title="PayCycle" href="https://www.paycycle.com/external/home.jsp" target="_blank">PayCycle</a> to re-design <a title="Set up process" href="https://www.paycycle.com/signup/hubs/start.jsp?signup=true">the set up process of their award-winning payroll management product</a>. We are thrilled to see the first stage of this work released to the public and pleased to announce our involvement.</p>
<p>Setting up payroll is a difficult process – think taxes on steroids. There is a lot of data to keep track of and tax laws to comply with. PayCycle wanted to support people through this process. To accomplish this, we designed a research initiative to better understand how people think about payroll, perform payroll activities, and how they experienced PayCycle’s existing set up system. Armed with a rich data set, we re-structured the information architecture, significantly changed the interaction model, and developed a new visual language. We also worked with the team to further develop user experience practices that would support their work on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Some areas we focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expectations</strong> – Customers were unable to accurately predict the amount of time it would take to complete the set up process. Almost universally, they imagined it would take them an hour – even if they were 3 hours into the process. To support these customers, we focused on ways to set expectations, help them gather materials, and break the work up into more manageable chunks</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interruptions</strong> – Small business owners are constantly interrupted. They also need information for the payroll set up that is sometimes not readily accessible. We made it easy for folks to tackle smaller pieces at a time and easily pick up where they left off.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiencies</strong> – With the PayCycle team, we got busy asking ourselves hard questions. What trade-offs could we make to shorten the process? Did we really need every piece of information up front or could we ask for some pieces later? If we didn’t gather all the information up front, what might be some unintended consequences on, say, the call center?</li>
</ul>
<p>While it’s hard to deliver “easy” in the context of payroll set up, the new process provides insight into how much further customers have to go, and rewards them with encouragement at important points along the way. In addition to having a great new set up process for the PayCycle service, the PayCycle team now more deeply understands their customers’ experience and can use this knowledge in ongoing design work. Finally, because PayCycle operates in a space where technology is not the primary competitive driver, PayCycle’s ability to bring design innovation to their customer experience supports their position as the market leader.</p>
<p>We worked with a lot of great people at PayCycle including our core team of Lynn McLeod, Eric Schenk, Karen White, and Martin Gates. Further excellent work was done by Ariege Mishergi, Scott Hatcher, Desiree McCrorey, Yogesh Bhumralkar, and Erich Zeigler, and Garret Seevers. Finally, the management team of Jim Heeger, Leo Redmond, Kathleen Echeverria, Tanya Roberts, Susie Helfrey, and Dan Hing offered us invaluable support.</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank the excellent Adaptive Path team which included Henning Fischer, Chiara Fox, Brian Cronin, Julie Hamwood, Kumi Akiyoshi, Julia Houck-Whitaker, and Emily Chang and Max Kiesler of Ideacodes.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the work, we recently posted a <a title="PayCycle Case Study" href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/services/casestudies/paycycle/">case study</a> on the project.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased as punch to announce our 2009 events line up <em>before </em>2009. This fulfills our 2008 resolution to plan farther in advance. Pats on the back all around, guys. Good job, good job.</p>
<p>You get a pat on the back too, in the form of extra savings (15% off the current registration price) when you register for any Adaptive Path conference, workshop or virtual seminar before the end of the year. More on that below.</p>
<p>We are really excited about the year to come. Not only are we bringing you our staples: UX Week, UX Intensive and MX: Managing Experience, we&#8217;re also introducing two new events to the mix&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Managing Design Projects</strong> is a one day event held at Fort Mason in San Francisco for project managers, product managers and program managers &#8212; you know, the people that keep it all running smoothly. Adaptive Path&#8217;s PMs realized there weren&#8217;t really any events out there addressing their needs. So, like the industrious folks they are, they created their own. </p>
<p><strong>Good Design Faster: High-Value Experience Design</strong> is based on workshops that first debuted at UX Week 2008. This workshop will take you from back-of-the-napkin sketching to the presentation and prototyping of design concepts in two fast-paced days. Join us at Dogpatch Studios (a space which will inspire!) this spring. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re also aiming to bring you a new <strong>virtual seminar</strong> once a month led by a member of the Adaptive Path team. Enjoy in the comfort of your own cubicle for only $129: </p>
<ul>
<li>December: Sailing the C&#8217;s of Change with Kate Rutter</li>
<li>January: Mobile User Experience with Rachel Hinman</li>
<li>February: 16 (Moslty) Difficult Steps to Becoming a Customer Experience-Driven Organization with Peter Merholz</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MX: Managing Experience</strong>, our conference for managers, VPs, directors and other boss types has a stellar roster of speakers again this year: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Temkin, VP, Principal Analyst, Forrester Research</li>
<li>Dan Roam, author of <em>The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures</em></li>
<li>David Butler, Vice President of Design at Coca-Cola</li>
<li>Khoi Vinh, Design Director for NYTimes.com</li>
<li>Margret Schmidt, VP, User Experience Design &amp; Research, TiVo</li>
<li>Margaret Gould Stewart, Manager, User Experience, Google back by popular demand</li>
<li>Marty Neumeir, President of Neutron</li>
<li>Sara Beckman, Co-Director of the Management of Technology Program, Haas School of Business</li>
<li>Scott Berkun, author of <em>Making Things Happen</em> and <em>Myths of Innovation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the feedback from last year&#8217;s MX indicated that you wanted more hands-on, take-away content, so you&#8217;ll see half of the first day devoted to more interactive, workshoppy, problem solving good times. To have a look at some of the highlights from MX 2008, head over <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/events/2009/mar/" target="_self">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>UX Intensive</strong>, our traveling band of a experience merry makers, will be in Berlin in May, San Francisco in June, and Washington, D.C. in November. This four-day workshop series is for UX professionals wanting to take their practice to the next level. Attend all four days, or the individual days that suit your needs best. </p>
<p>And last but not least, our flagship event, <strong>UX Week &#8211; </strong>the premier user experience conference &#8212; is in September next year. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>So, back to that discount thing. Register by the end of the year and we&#8217;ll take 15% off the current (already discounted) registration price. This is as cheap as our events are going to get, so act now! Use code <strong>RNSB</strong> (stands for register now save big) on our registration form. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple months ago I had the pleasure of traveling to South Carolina to attend a driving course at the BMW performance driving school. My father had recently purchased an M Series car and attending the school with a guest was part of that package. I love driving, so I was thrilled at the opportunity to take some tricked-out BMWs onto the track. What I didn&#8217;t expect was a well crafted experience from start to finish. The weekend really summed up how powerful a great experience can be. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p>The experience actually started in a BMW showroom when my father went in to learn about the car in the first place. These cars are marketed to driving aficionados who are often interested in the mechanics of how they work. BMW has lead automobile innovation for a long time, and the M Series of cars is the product line that expresses this innovation most. For those interested in these cars there is extensive information about what makes them so remarkable online. What will probably be more engaging to the readers of this post, however, is how BMW uses Microsoft Surface screens in their showrooms:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="295" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gX6u1mTZHPQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="295" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gX6u1mTZHPQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>BMW presents technical information alongside information about their driving schools where owners have the opportunity to get training by some very talented, and competitive, drivers. You can watch some of those videos <a href="http://www.bmwusa.com/Standard/Content/Experience/Events/PDS/Schools/Default.aspx?enc=/eiUrYOZAxtXbrazY6tfkmnueZmuSV+mTyz9vrTx7NirE7X5FaRwQ2/z/Xmw9HUv+YTtRWjk7rqgOh4SgEcFB0AH9cjifZUEs6jJW+IxJRKPipgEH+TI3ENQJxTgVCy5Mv+VuPgvdJ2UMwkxII534TjmcfzVoUhAS6KofoX7wDM=">here</a>. Together these presentations are compelling, emotionally inspiring, and contagious enough to make most people want to put the pedal to the metal. But, if you&#8217;re not interested in the track, BMW has other experiences on tap. For example, you can pick the car up in Germany and take a road trip through Europe before heading home with the car.</p>
<p>One interesting note about the factory in Germany is that it was one of the first places to use audio tours, which later made their way into blockbuster museum exhibitions. It seems that they are very capable of bringing their design thinking outside of the cars themselves. Before leaving for South Carolina, BMW sent me a nice letter of introduction, an itinerary, and a list of what to bring. When we arrived in South Carolina they were waiting for us in BMW SUVs that took us to our hotel. They&#8217;d a BMW branded menu at the restaurant (ok that may have gone too far, but it was a tasty meal), shirts and hats were left in our rooms, and cars were provided if we wanted to catch a movie in the evening. When we got up the next morning there was a bus to take us over to the driving center (sadly, not a BMW bus), which was an impressive bit of architecture.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to go too deeply into the curriculum of the driving school itself, but I will say that it was well run and a lot of fun. There was a good mix of play and instruction. I would, however, like to highlight what happened when I got home from the school. A couple weeks after the course. I received a DVD in the mail with footage of my training so they could review my performance, and continue to try and build on the skills that I was introduced to. What I find interesting about the videos is that they embed the speedometer an tachometer into the image along with a representation of where you are on the track. Here is a video clip of my 65 year old father winning a race on a short loop course in the rain (he beat me by three stinking tenths of a second).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=5fe7173696&amp;photo_id=3084234076" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=63881" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=63881" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor="#000000" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=5fe7173696&amp;photo_id=3084234076"></embed></object></p>
<p>While we were at the school I heard a story of how the BMW design approach had been a barrier to user experience at least once. Apparently, BMW&#8217;s M Series cars did not have cup holders for a long time because the designers did not believe it was safe, or appropriate, to drink beverages while driving. When they did initially install them, they were apparently of poor quality. Fortunately for my father, it seems they&#8217;ve rectified this issue.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the BMW iDrive, which a computer system used to control most secondary vehicle systems in many current BMW cars. iDrive&#8217;s user interface consists of a LCD panel mounted in the dashboard and a controller knob mounted on the center console. iDrive allows the driver and front-seat passenger to control such amenities as the climate (air conditioner and heater), the audio system (radio and CD player), the navigation system and communication system. This is another area where the user experience seems to break down a little bit. You can read some of the critical reviews here:</p>

</ol>
<p>Based on my experience on the track I&#8217;d say that many of these issues are still present in iDrive. There is a fairly steep learning curve, and the system seems to contradict the safety concerns that made the BMW designers resist cup holders. In other words, it&#8217;s hard to use when driving, which could be dangerous. This begs a question about how siloed the design teams are at BMW, and makes me think there is probably an opportunity here for better management of user experience.</p>
<p>As your industry grows, and user experience teams become more embedded in product and service development practices, there will be a greater and greater need to focus on the managemnet side or our practice. Our conference <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/2009/mar/">MX: Managing Experience</a> is all about this effort. If you&#8217;re having these kinds you issues please check the conference out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nate Fortin at Cooper writes throughtfully about the <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/11/a_unified_approach_to_design.html">integration of interaction design and visual design</a>.</p>
<p>The Mumbai Attackes saddened us. But its interesting to see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/world/asia/30twitter.html?_r=2&amp;hp">the roll Twitter and Flickr played in getting the news out</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/02/tivo.guilt/index.html">TiVo guilt</a> means we might feel that we have to watch all those recorded show, or maybe it means we&#8217;re just disconnected from <em>eventness</em>, that is, &#8220;the phenomenon of experiencing something in connection with other people. The longer a program sits on your DVR before you watch it, goes the theory, the less satisfying an experience it will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthropologists Genevieve Bell <a href="http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/mp3/Bell_Public_Lecture.mp3">discusses the future of our digital lives (MP3)</a>, pointing out that the internet has gone feral (at 10:40). Rawr.</p>

Nor for that matter does a fear of failure.&#8221; Amen.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, we are hosting our UX Intensive workshop in Austin this next week.  It&#8217;s our first big event since Austin became one of our home towns.  The event itself will be great but missing the workshop doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to be left out.  On Tuesday, December 9th, we&#8217;re heading over to Club DeVille for a gathering of UX Intensive attendees. We&#8217;re also inviting local pals and members of the UX community in Austin to come and hang out, talk shop (or not) and have a few drinks and light appetizers on us. </p>
<p>Join us!<br />
<a href="http://austin.citysearch.com/profile/10202592">Club DeVille</a><br />
Tuesday, December 9th<br />
6:30-8:30<br />
RSVP to analisa AT adaptivepath D0T com if you&#8217;ll be joining us. Let her know how many people are in your party.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.braintraffic.com/">Braaaaains from Brain Traffic</a>, that is. Congrats to our colleagues over at <strong>Brain Traffic</strong> for <a href="http://www.braintraffic.com/">launching their site redesign</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.braintraffic.com/our-people/kristina-halvorson/">Kristina Halvorson</a> and <a href="http://www.braintraffic.com/our-people/">her merry band</a> have taken up the charge of filling the world with smart, useful web content. As thinkers, do-ers and dreamers, Brain Traffic is committed to making sure that <strong>words</strong> are a critical part of any online strategy.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of co-authoring an essay with Kristina earlier this year (<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/essays/archives/000959.php">Death to Lorum Ipsum and Other Adventures in Content</a>) and her quote captures the essence of the content challenge:</p>
<p><em>I feel sorry for the poor, poor words that no one wants to take responsibility for. And I feel especially sorry for site users who end up with a terrible experience because, after all the money was spent on UX strategy and interface design, the content still ended up sucking.</em> — Kristina</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important topic in the nature of products: what we write, the tone of voice, the way a product or service communicates about itself is shifting to become evocative, not prescriptive. And our content strategies, words, and writing need to evolve as well. It&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap that words belong to someone else. But that&#8217;s increasingly a strategy for failure, not for success.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m eager to read what Brain Traffic has to say on the topic.</p>
<p>Mmmmm content braaaaains. My favorite.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of great events for designers, we even <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/events/" target="_blank">host</a> a handful of them, but what about events for folks that are often behind the scenes managing the projects or programs, and products? The project management team here at Adaptive Path noticed there weren’t any. So&#8230;We’ve created our own!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/events/2009/feb/">Managing Design Projects</a>, a brand new event with Adaptive Path targeted towards product managers, project managers and producers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a long-standing Internet brand and IAC property redesigns, it’s bound to garner much buzz and attention. <a href="http://www.citysearch.com">Citysearch</a>, a pioneer in the local search market, recently unveiled the <a href="http://beta.citysearch.com">beta of their site redesign</a>. Adaptive Path is thrilled to see the beta and is proud to announce our involvement in that effort.</p>
<p>In early 2008, my team and I had the opportunity to work closely with the very talented Citysearch team to redesign the Citysearch web experience and to take local neighborhood search to the next level.</p>
<p>As you may have read on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/18/the-new-citysearch-launches-in-beta-goes-hyper-social-with-facebook-connect/">TechCrunch</a> the beta site&#8217;s key themes ripple through the entire redesign:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More local</strong> : Expanded local coverage now reaches deep into your local neighborhood. It&#8217;s easier than ever to find local businesses and activities that are near to you, since the new site hones in on over 75,000 towns and neighborhoods. And the information about local businesses restores the balance among key voices: users, city editors and merchants.</li>
<li><strong>More social</strong> :  It&#8217;s easier than ever to participate, contribute reviews and post opinions. The new site also provides deeper connections with social networks, starting with Facebook Connect.</li>
<li><strong>More intuitive</strong> : Streamlined search and navigation gets you to content easier than ever, while simplified registration and review posting makes it quick to get involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Citysearch was hard at work on redeveloping their technical infrastructure when they approached Adaptive Path last winter. Adaptive Path began working intensely with Citysearch to design the interfaces and interactions that would leverage the new opportunities available in their technology platform. The beta site represents the resulting work from the Citysearch-Adaptive Path collaboration. The level of collaboration with the Citysearch team was intense. We worked side-by-side to envision the new site and craft the new Web experience.</p>
<p>As the site design rolls from beta into full launch, there will be an opportunity to discuss our work in greater detail, but for the time being, I want to express my thanks to the people that made all of this possible. On the AP side, I want to thank my colleagues Chiara Fox, Lucie Moses, Margaret Shear, Peter Merholz and Todd Elliott for ensuring that the resulting Citysearch experience was exceptional, and for the energy and enthusiasm that characterized our collaboration with Citysearch.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the immensely talented and dedicated Citysearch team: Annouchka Yameogo-Stanzler, David Arnerich, Edmond To, Eric Small, Hal Oreif, Holly Van Dyke, J.F. Boisvert, Mike Phillips, Moonie Lantion, Nils Devine, Robert Moritz, Rob Rhoden, Sue Antico, and the ever-inspired, ever-energetic Citysearch CEO Jay Herratti.</p>
<p>The beta represents a new phase in the Citysearch experience&#8230;one that will fundamentally improve user engagement in local content and knit together social media and local search. I’m delighted to have reached this milestone alongside the Citysearch team, and eager for what comes next.</p>
