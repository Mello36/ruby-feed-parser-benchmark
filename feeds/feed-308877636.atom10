			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Last week, I attended my first-ever Gartner event - the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=611509" target="_blank">Gartner CRM Summit</a>. After five years as a Forrester analyst, it was nice to get exposure to how the other half lives. According to Gartner over 600 attendees representing 25 countries attended the event held at the <a href="http://www.gaylordhotels.com/gaylord-national/" target="_blank">National Harbor Resort</a> (a surreal manufactured enclave just outside of DC). I don&#8217;t know how other attendees felt but, I have to say, the venue was a bit reminiscent of that Jim Carrey movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYj2m1yVpGU" target="_blank">The Truman Show</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>My favorite Gartner speaker was <a href="http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=7089" target="_blank">Ed Thompson</a> who presented the opening keynote entitled &#8220;Improving the Customer Experience.&#8221; Ed warned the audience that he would speak quickly and accelerate as he went on and, that, he did.</p>
<p>Ed&#8217;s opening one-liner: &#8220;Why should you care about customer experience? The boss says you have to&#8230;&#8221; That certainly jives with my experience that &#8220;customer experience&#8221; is a top initiative in most companies these days. But, as Ed aptly pointed out, few companies have a clear and consistent definition for what they mean by &#8220;customer experience&#8221; (CXP). Often, depending upon which group you talk to within an organization, you get several different definitions. Different groups also measure customer experience in different ways. For instance, customer service groups might measure customer satisfaction, while marketing measures retention, and engineering measures quality. All that&#8217;s ok - in fact it&#8217;s a good thing. The key point? Before embarking on a CXP initiative bring all of the diverse people together clearly define your objectives, the tactics for achieving those objectives, and how you will measure success.</p>
<p>In fact, Ed says &#8220;lots of companies give up before they see the improvement.&#8221; Many companies have applied the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model" target="_blank">model</a> developed by Professor Noriaki Kano to CXP projects.</p>
<p>Ed&#8217;s pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the basics right.</li>
<li>Focus on moving above average before, during, and after the experience. Plan to move some investment to setting customer expectations, getting more customer feedback, and reacting to the feedback.</li>
<li>Stay on top and avoid the middle ground by excelling in one of three dimensions: 
<ol>
<li>Product leadership (e.g., Apple)</li>
<li>Customer intimacy (e.g., USAA)</li>
<li>Operational efficiency (e.g., Southwest Airlines)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the investment point above, I was disappointed, although not terribly surprised, to hear the results of a Gartner study revealing that while 95% of firms survey customers to get feedback, a paltry 10% do anything with that feedback.</p>
<p>Ed also talked about the large numbers of companies creating executive level positions focused on customer experience (e.g., VP of Customer Experience). Unlike some industry pundits who espouse Customer Experience Officer C-level positions, I was happy (because it aligns with my own <a href="http://nxteramarketing.wordpress.com/2007/12/" target="_blank">view</a>) to hear Ed indicate that, in his experience, he typically sees this position reporting to the CMO. Is the CXP executive a fad role? &#8220;No,&#8221; says Ed, &#8220;if European companies are adopting it, it couldn&#8217;t just be a fad started in California&#8221; (this elicited another chuckle from me).</p>
<p>Finally, I was happy to hear Ed fire a few bullets at <a href="http://www.netpromoter.com/" target="_blank">NetPromoter</a> (NPS) saying (as I have also <a href="http://nxteramarketing.wordpress.com/?s=netpromoter" target="_blank">said</a>) that the metric isn&#8217;t a silver bullet, that more than one question is necessary, and NPS doesn&#8217;t help companies with causal analysis. He further indicated that NPS is useful in some industries some of the time, but not in all channels, and isn&#8217;t a great metric across all company types (e.g., B2B firms). The best use of NPV? Give to your board of directors, but don&#8217;t stop analyzing and measuring lots of other things.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Campaign-management technology has long been associated with the creation and deployment of outbound marketing campaigns. It&#8217;s time to change that. Marketing can no longer afford to simply act as a bullhorn pushing the product du jour or blasting cross-sell and up-sell offers.</p>
<p>Marketing experts have been talking about ad overload for years now. Simply put:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers are overwhelmed with ad content.</li>
<li>They are tuning the messages out.</li>
<li>Response rates are declining while costs are rising.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing organizations must evolve by shifting their communications strategy away from one-size fits all push marketing to a more customer-centric strategy that leverages the increasing proliferation of addressable channels and strives for responsiveness to individual customer behaviors. This shift requires marketing organizations to get beyond the old-style outbound campaign construct and seek to engage customers and prospects in a cross-channel dialog that builds upon their past and current behavior (I refer to this new style of marketing as interactive marketing). To do this effectively, marketers need technologies that enable them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to all information provided by customers and prospects &#8212; both explicit and implied.</li>
<li>Understand past and present information to determine the best possible marketing action.</li>
<li>Communicate in a compelling, timely, and relevant manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s more, technologies must enable marketers to interact across inbound as well as outbound channels in an integrated way. Enter next-generation campaign management.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Next-Generation Campaign Management</strong></p>
<p>Helping marketing organizations achieve this transition requires marketing technology providers to step up and outside the box. Campaign management is no longer about segmentation and list pull. Next-generation campaign management technologies must emerge that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are customer-aware.</strong> The key to listening is the ability to capture what a buyer is saying &#8212; both explicitly and implicitly &#8212; and to process that information to determine what to say next. This requires a campaign-management solution that has the capability to leverage and process both a customer&#8217;s past history, as well as present situation, in order to make predictions about likely future behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Provide centralized decision making.</strong> Capturing both what the customer says, as well as how he responds to what you say, is fundamental to the shift to interactive marketing. That means next-generation campaign management solutions must provide a centralized decision-making capability that determines the best marketing message to extend in outbound and inbound marketing channels &#8212; online and offline.</li>
<li><strong>Enable cross-channel execution.</strong> Your buyers interact with you across multiple channels and expect both a consistent and seamless experience as they move between channels. Anyone involved with a customer experience initiative knows this is a hard problem to solve. Next-generation campaign management solutions can help. By enabling cross-channel (inbound/outbound, online/offline) execution and providing the fundamental capability to compile a comprehensive marketing communication and response history, next-generation campaign management can help drive message and treatment consistency as well as a seamless experience as customers interact with the enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate marketing operations.</strong> In any mid-sized or large company today, effective interactive marketing along the lines of what I&#8217;m describing has a lot of moving parts and requires collaboration across many disparate groups within the marketing function. To ease these challenges, next-generation campaign management must help marketers improve collaboration and facilitate cross-channel planning, design, execution, and measurement.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">For nearly the past 15 years, my career has been focused on helping marketers leverage data to better understand and more effectively market to customers on an individual level. In my early days in the industry, I worked primarily with marketing groups leveraging offline channels like catalogs and other forms of direct mail. In recent years, I&#8217;ve spent most of my time working with relationship marketing and database marketing groups and with online marketing groups. What amazes me (and is my key topic of my post today) is that while these marketers view themselves as so different they are really starting to converge.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><strong>Marketing Channels Are Evolving</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">There&#8217;s lots of change happening in the marketing domain. It&#8217;s a time of uncertainty but also one of opportunity.  Marketing channels are evolving at a rapid rate:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0;" type="disc">
<li>Mass media is less and less effective as audiences fragment and adopt technologies and tools (like DVRs) that enable them to tune out ads.</li>
<li>The Internet is no longer &#8220;new media&#8221; since most consumers are online.</li>
<li>Traditional outbound direct marketing channels require more analytic sophistication as response rates decline and more states consider and adopt privacy legislation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><strong>Addressability Is the Common Link</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">Addressable channels are channels both outbound and inbound - through which marketing can communicate directly with an individual - identifiable or anonymous. This includes traditional direct marketing channels including direct mail and phone, internet channels like Web sites, email, mobile, and social media and, as technology and distribution capabilities continue to evolve, even traditional mass marketing channels like TV, billboards, and radio.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">As addressable channels become more prevalent, marketers are recognizing that they need new skills to effectively engage, communicate, and interact with customers. Specifically, marketers must:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0;" type="disc">
<li><strong>Listen</strong> to all information provided by customers and prospects - both explicit and implied.</li>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> past and present information to determine the best possible marketing action.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate</strong> in a compelling, timely, and relevant manner.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">What&#8217;s more, marketers must do this across <em>inbound</em> as well as outbound channels and in an <em>integrated</em> way.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><strong>Interactive Marketing Will Emerge As A Dominant Marketing Discipline</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">I believe that the best term to describe the fusion of these capabilities is &#8220;interactive marketing&#8221; which I will define as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">Engaging each customer and prospect in a cross-channel dialog that builds upon their past and current behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">Although the term isn&#8217;t new, few (other than <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=jdeighton">Prof. John Deighton</a> of Harvard who is widely credited with coining the term) define it as broadly as I have here.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">What&#8217;s interesting is that, in many organizations, the required capabilities already reside in different parts of the company - relationship marketing, database marketing, online marketing, ecommerce, etc. Unfortunately, rather than integrating these skills many of the companies I talk with are adding duplicate capabilities within stovepipe marketing groups. The result? A widening gap between &#8220;online&#8221; and &#8220;direct&#8221; marketing functions.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10pt;">Rather than continuing to grow the silos, companies should explore cross-training, opening lines of communication, and integrating marketing teams that communicate with customers via addressable channels.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Well folks, wanted to let everyone know that I&#8217;m going back to work for &#8220;the man&#8221; and his name is <a title="Yuchun Lee Bio" href="http://www.unica.com/about/mgmt.cfm?pw=yule" target="_blank">Yuchun Lee.</a> As of Monday, I am officially on staff at <a title="Unica Home Page" href="http://www.unica.com" target="_blank">Unica</a> where I will lead product marketing and strategy (<a href="http://www.unica.com/news/pr.cfm?id=476" target="_blank">link to press release</a>). I&#8217;m really excited about this move. When I left <a title="Forrester Home Page" href="http://www.forrester.com" target="_blank">Forrester</a>, I told my friends and colleagues that I was tired of just talking about technology enabled marketing. I said that I wanted to put my ideas into action and go and build something. Who better to do it with than the leading company in the sector? </p>
<p>I will continue blogging and, although I will no longer be a true independent, I will continue to keep my blog going in the same vein and not use it as place for shameless promotion of my company. It&#8217;s also my hope to tap some of the smart minds at Unica and get them into the blogosphere as well.</p>
<p>In fact, check out my colleague Akin Arikan publishes an excellent blog: <a title="Multichannel Metrics Blog" href="http://www.multichannelmetrics.com/" target="_blank">Multichannel Metrics</a>. Akin also just published a book, <a title="About Multichannel Metrics" href="http://www.multichannelmetrics.com/?page_id=7" target="_blank">Multichannel Marketing </a>(which I reviewed before I knew I was going to Unica). The book includes a lot of great examples and tactical advice. It also does a great job introducing marketers from different disciplines (e.g., direct marketing and web analytics) to one another and making the case for why deeper collaboration can yield multiplicative results. For another reviewer&#8217;s opinion on the book, see Jim Novo&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/05/21/multichannel-marketing-akin-arikan/" target="_blank">comments</a> on his <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I realize that the title of this post already has some customer service gurus cringing. No, my point is not to turn service interactions into one-way communication streams in which the customer&#8217;s needs are minimized while CSRs focus on pushy &#8220;retention,&#8221; cross-sell, or upsell efforts&#8230; And, if you are familiar with any of my prior writings then you know that I hold marketing responsible for customer experience. With that quick frame of reference, inbound service interactions are ideal for marketing because the customer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is engaged, by choice.</li>
<li>Actively provides information that points to problems or needs.</li>
<li>May have a need <em>now</em> that, if missed, becomes a lost opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, strategies to leverage customer service as a marketing channel will fail if we approach customer interactions with the traditional marketing mindset - let&#8217;s tell customers what we want him to hear. Many of us have been talking about this for years, but the time has come. Firms must shift communications strategies away from one-size fits all push marketing - to one that is responsive to individual customer behaviors. To make the shift successfully, <strong>marketing organizations must get beyond the old style campaign construct</strong>. The very term &#8220;campaign&#8221; conjures up the image of a bullhorn - marketers shouting out what they want their audience to hear. With the control and choice that consumers have today, marketing must be more flexible &#8212; more agile. Marketing and service organizations must align their strategies and:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize that every service interaction has potential brand impact.</strong> Many customer service centers are measured purely by cost metrics and that result in processes that are internally focused, not customer-focused. Most consumers can recount nightmarish customer service experiences and, today, many are well publicized by jaded customers through vehicles like <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I&#8217;m not purporting that cost metrics aren&#8217;t important. But, the cost of losing a customer due to a terrible service interaction or the word of mouth associated with broad exposure by disgruntled customers through today&#8217;s social channels must also be taken into consideration. And, yes, it is hard to account for all of these costs in an financial spreadsheet. At a minimum, firms can start by mapping and understanding processes from the outside in - that is the customer point of view - as well as the inside out.</li>
<li><strong>Consider each interaction as an opportunity to establish an emotional connection.</strong> Years ago we talked about &#8220;delighting&#8221; the customer&#8230; The term always struck me as corny and I&#8217;ve noticed that I, as a consumer, am so jaded by my past customer service experiences that I am pleasantly surprised when I get a friendly voice on the other end of the phone that sounds genuinely eager to help me out or empathizes with me if I am upset. Again, it starts with the little things &#8212; like being human.</li>
<li><strong>Only possibly, seek extend the financial relationship.</strong> As I&#8217;ve already indicated, customer service interactions present an opportunity in which customers will willingly provide information in exchange for value. This exchange may yield an opportunity but, it requires active listening and capturing information in real time relative to customer&#8217;s issues and needs. Using the interaction to push the product du jour &#8212; while it may work occasionally &#8212; is more likely to be rejected, potentially annoy your customer, and increase your call time.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I write this, I admit that I have concerns that what I write will be misconstrued or misused. I&#8217;ve been talking in public forums about the intersection between marketing and service since 2002. Unfortunately, while companies in many industries have taken steps to turn their customer service centers into revenue generators, I believe that most have done so to the detriment of the customer experience. That is, they view inbound service interactions only from the perspective of the potential financial benefit that could result from selling something new, extending a contract, etc. These companies are still operating in one-way mode and failing to recognize that they have an opportunity to establish a dialog with their customer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Marketing organizations are contributing to customer experience initiatives by working to deliver more relevant content in both outbound and inbound channels. While technology is certainly no silver bullet, marketing organizations are turning to technology to help them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate.</strong> As marketing organizations seek to deliver more relevant and individualized customer experiences they begin to change their marketing communications mix away from a pure outbound push model to incorporate messaging tactics driven by customer behaviors and actions. In addition to being very responsive to the customer, these tactics are ideal because they can be automated. Today&#8217;s campaign management solutions are maturing beyond support for the traditional push campaigns to facilitate campaign automation through functions like real-time data integration and event detection, multi-stage campaign process flows, and business-rule-driven automation.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate.</strong> Relevance is not just about the message. Relevance requires an equal focus on time and place. And, when considered from the customer&#8217;s perspective, relevance is inherently multichannel and integrated. As marketing organizations work to increase their relevance, become more customer-focused, and create differentiated customer experiences, they will need to collaborate more - a lot more - with other marketing teams and with other functional areas of the company (like customer service). Marketing resource management technology can help facilitate collaboration by providing a consolidated marketing calendar, establishing common work areas for virtual teams, and facilitating processes, as interdisciplinary teams work to design, build, and launch integrated programs.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate.</strong> Integration is a fundamental requirement of relevant marketing. Whether it is integrating disparate data from various systems across the enterprise or integrating teams to streamline marketing processes, technology is required. Moreover, marketing application suites that are themselves integrated and support the entire marketing process - from planning through design, execution, and measurement - can dramatically simplify the complexity that marketers face as they work to become more relevant and customer-focused.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marketing Organizations Must Increase Their Technology IQ</strong></p>
<p>Just as technology is a critical enabler of relevant marketing, it can also be a major barrier. Why? Many marketing organizations don&#8217;t take enough ownership of technology. Marketers - and the technology groups that support them - must recognize that technology is a key component of marketing operations - that relevant marketing requires day-to-day access to data and iterative levels of analysis, needs not well-met by traditional project-focused IT organizations. Marketing organizations that want to differentiate customer experiences through customer-focused and relevant marketing communications and content delivery must bring technology expertise under the umbrella of the marketing organization - either internally or through a trusted services partner that behaves as an extension of the marketing team.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I am very excited to announce the launch of my latest research, &#8220;Marketing Beyond The Status Quo.&#8221; The research, sponsored by my friends at <a title="Responsys Home Page" href="http://www.responsys.com" target="_blank">Responsys</a>, seeks to help marketing organizations assess and address the barriers that prevent them from being more customer-focused, relevant, and integrated. The report unveils the Marketing Status Quo (MSQ) Model - backed by a diagnostic self-test and step-by-step program guide - to help marketers determine their relevance maturity and develop a realistic action plan to become more customer-focused.</p>
<p>The MSQ Model assesses the fundamental competencies required for marketing relevance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategic</strong>: How customer-focused are your marketing efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Analytical</strong>:How strategic and actionable is your customer insight?</li>
<li><strong>Technical</strong>: How well-suited is your infrastructure to support customer-focused marketing?</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: How collaborative, efficient and error-free are your marketing operations?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57" src="http://nxteramarketing.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/msq_model_levels.jpg?w=460&#038;h=246" alt="MSQ Model" width="460" height="246" /></p>
<p>Each competency is equally weighted and combined to yield an overall Relevance Maturity Score, which defines a MSQ Level ranging from 1 (broadcast) to 5 (integrated). Marketers can leverage the model in conjunction with the MSQ Self-Test to assess their status quo, as well as identify the steps they must take in order to successfully move to the next level. </p>
