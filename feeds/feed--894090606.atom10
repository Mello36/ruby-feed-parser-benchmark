		<description>ack, i too often forget that teasing rarely comes through in text, except for friends and acquaintances.

nothing philosophical about what i wrote, it can be called mysticism if a label is needed.

one is just the way it is, even in that other book.

thanks for your reply, gregory lent</description>

		<description>Thanks for your response. Interaction is always good - although I disagree on a couple of major points :roll:

First of all, I find it a bit ironic that you're calling me a literalist when you appear to be a literalist of another sort. You've read a book (not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; book, I'd point out) and appear to have regurgitated it pretty much ad verbum into the comments box, claiming it as the definitive theory of six degrees of separation. There is no definitive theory with any academic concept such as this, and so implying that your point is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; right answer shows a lack of broader knowledge.

And second, yes I'm taking the six degrees theory literally. However, in this context this is the correct interpretation. Microsoft's study examined the concept in terms of the number of links in the chain, and so based it on the what you call the 'literal' viewpoint rather than your philosophical one. As such, for continuity and to read it as the author intended any commentary on the study should read it largely with this viewpoint in mind.

		<description>ha, you are a literal-ist .. i read the book on this, and the 6 degrees thing was just what they told them in kindergarten, to sort of make a point that the world was a bit smaller and comfier that they previously thought.

by the time you get to the end of the book, and have matured, grown in consciousness, established a more subtle understanding, the climax is great.  it turns out there are NO degrees of separation between anybody or anything.

some of the more juvenile minds still needed convincing, to them it was pointed out that nature was the perfect example of a seamlessly whole system ... scrape the dust off a leaf in brazil, it came from the sahara, etc.

it is consciousness that turns out to be the unifying factor for people.  the group mind, collective intelligence, the terms batted about in the early days of the internet when "social media" was, like, really cool.  such a sad beginning, and such an amazing ending.

technology is just consciousness in action, and when the tech hooked it all up, the mind saw that it could already do it all.  some guys called it the singularity, but that was just words.  the knowers simple were connected to everything everywhere all at once, and had small smiles.  sort of like the buddha.

enjoy reality,
