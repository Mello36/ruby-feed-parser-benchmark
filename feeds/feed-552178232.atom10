The monk can use them, but, at higher levels particularly, often does better without.” (Bards' tale manual)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Thirst for existence, O monks, has a specific condition, it is nourished by something, it also does not go without support. And what is that nourishment? It is &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;ignorance&lt;/span&gt; experience levels!” (Buddha, with author’s twist at the end)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II. Manual Information.&lt;br /&gt;a. The manual.&lt;br /&gt;Monks are able martial artists striving to achieve perfect mastery of body, mind and spirit. They are experts at fighting unarmed, very good at dodging attacks and strong of will. Monks need to be unencumbered to be able to use their special martial art powers. Monks take vows of poverty at their initiation to prevent distraction by worldly means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monks are trained in the following skills: Alertness, athletics, concentration, dodge, find weakness, healing, literacy, and stealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The further monks advance, the more they hone their movement skills and unarmed combat powers. At level 6 monks learn to use a circular kick with which they can hit every opponent in the vicinity (but also all friends, so be careful). Using this kick costs 2500 energy points. At level 12 a normal move costs them but 800 energy points, at level 18 but 600 energy points. At level 25 monks become able to change positions with hostile opponents. At level 32 they can score instant kills in melee combat against up to human-sized creatures. At level 40 they can do so against humanoids of any size. At level 50 they have become so attached to the flow of the universe that they actually are able to resist Chaos to a certain limit - Chaos effects are lowered by 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b. Undocumented features.&lt;br /&gt;* The monk can kick down walls to at level 13. This ability will produce rocks as well as ore and gems if you have gemology skill.&lt;br /&gt;* The monk does not receive true-berserking bonus when fighting barehanded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c. Understanding the manual.&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 - The monks special martial power:&lt;br /&gt;Monks gain a bonus to barehanded combat. At the start they have a barehanded attack doing 1d9 damage, compared to 1d3 for other classes except beastfighter. Each level the max damage will increase with one, and each 4 levels you will get a +1 bonus to damage. First +1 bonus happens at level 4. There is a + to hit bonus too, it comes out to roughly +2 each level. In addition to there is the usual bonus from equipment, strength and weapon skill (unarmed combat)&lt;br /&gt;Here are some typical values you might expect from a monk character at certain key levels in the game. The estimates put below are very conservative, it should not be hard to beat these values and do more damage. Also you will hit criticals from time to time leading over time to a higher average (AVG) damage. But this is also not considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 1. No bonus:&lt;br /&gt;1d9 damage, AVG damage will be 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 10. No equipment bonus, +3 from skill (level 8-9), +2 from strength.&lt;br /&gt;1d18 + 7 damage, AVG damage will be 16,5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 20. +6 from equipment, +6 from skill (level 11-12), +4 from strength.&lt;br /&gt;1d28 +21 damage, AVG damage will be 35,5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 50. +12 from equipment, +10 from skill (level 14), +20 from strength.&lt;br /&gt;1d58 +54 damage, AVG damage will be 83,5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monks also receive a bonus to DV equal to 2/3 per level, for an increase of +33 to DV at level 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burdened status will eliminate both of these boni, as will wearing a shield.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing «heavy» armor will remove the DV bonus. To be precise, the allowed armors are: Robe, Black robe, Shirt of the Saints, Robes of Resistance, Elven Chain Mail, Clean Robe, Clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Notice the absence of «Ancient mummy wrappings» in the list even though it weighs the same as a robe. Also, strangely, “ugly clothes” are not tolerated. For those who dabble in smithing, note that the only smithable armor is the elven chain mail, made from mithril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that weapons will NOT take away the DV bonus. Monks, unlike beastfighters, receive no penalties from using weapons. In fact, this means that using two-handed weapons actually can be very worthwhile, as the DV-bonus will negate the penalty of not using a shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as a light fighter, the monk receives +1 speed per two levels gained. This bonus will stay even if character wields weapons, wears armor, or becomes burdened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 2 - The skillset&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the monks have the best skillset of all classes in ADOM. Great for melee and magic, and containing 3 skills I have used a wish on with other characters. For detailed information about skills, see the ADOM guidebook. I will only comment on what makes these good for monks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alertness - Avoiding damage is good for low-armored charcters. DV bonus helps along with other means to making the character unhittable at higher levels.&lt;br /&gt;Athletics - Extra speed along with class powers means that all monsters can be outrun. Also good for melee charaters attack speed, and for getting the crucial STR-increases on initially-weak monks faster.&lt;br /&gt;Concentration - Allows magic to be a serious playing-style for any monk, even at low levels.&lt;br /&gt;Dodge - Good for all characters, and like alertness helps the monk evade hits due to the extra DV bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Find weakness - Lacking in the slaying department, unarmed monks have use for the double-damage hits to damage certain tough opponents.&lt;br /&gt;Healing - self explanatory, if monks did not have this it would have made the early game a bit harder&lt;br /&gt;Literacy - available in the game, having this at start allows monks to start training to become a spellcaster right away.&lt;br /&gt;Stealth - available in the game, helps avoiding too-tough-to-handle early-game monsters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 3 - The class powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 6 - circular kick. For 2500 energy points, attack all NPC around you with a kick attack.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Very Bad.&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: This should almost never be used.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the best way to play ADOM is not getting surrounded. Fight monsters one at a time, if you become surrounded you should move towards a hallway, or a corridor. While this attack may seem to have merit in clearing the area around you, it really is dangerous to use. Any monsters not killed in the attack will have 1-2 free rounds in which to hit you afterwards. In this time other monsters will have time to close in and mabye even attack. Summoners will have time to summon.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, while waiting out the time of your action you may not heal yourself like you could have if you had performed a low-cost attack instead.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, your kick attack is a bit weaker than barehanded hit. Monks receive a bonus to kicking, but a typical 8th level character of mine had 1d16+9 on unarmed melee attack, but 1d14+7 on kick. It appears that boni from unarmed weapon combat skill is not factored in. This may well be a bug, since you gain melee marks from using the ability.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth point is that normal attacks are pretty fast. 2500 energy equals 2,5 attacks at weapon skill 0. If you have unarmed combat skill level 8 or higher, this means you can take 3 attacks instead of the kick, at weapons skill 15 4 attacks. So normally you have to be surrounded by more than 3 creatures for the ability to be cost-effective at all. This is not a position one should find oneself in.&lt;br /&gt;This really is a novelty skill, used if you are surrounded by harmless creatures. But I would rather be heading towards a corridor still, to mow down the enemies in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;One possible positive use for the ability would be standing in the middle of low-level summons like spiders, in order to gain weapon skill marks. But again, why not just attack them normally....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 12/18 - normal movement costs 800/600 energy points.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: There is no argument that fast movement is very powerful and always useful for any character. For a monk, this ability is useful because it makes wearing seven league boots less important, as you will outrun anything anyway. Instead wear heavily smithed boots for DV/PV (remember you have body-armor restriction) or even boots of speed (in order to attack faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 25 - can switch places with hostile monsters.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Very good.&lt;br /&gt;A potential life-saver, this ability can let you escape difficult situations, and also shuffle your way to take out a nasty summoner in the middle of a monster pack. On the other side, when you are level 25 your monks should be pretty tough (even naked) so you could easily go a whole game without ever using this ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 32/40 - can score instant kills against humanoids, man-sized and then every sized.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: One of the coolest skills in the game, it is, sadly, nothing one can rely on. A little informal testing indicated that it would activate in about 1 in 30 hits against man-sized humanoids. At character level 32, there are few man-sized humanoids that can survive a hit anyway. At level 40 the power extends giants and demons, but again informal testing against balors made the activation about 1 in 100. Not something to rely on. It does give a nice way to off Emperor Moloch, and if it can work against AnRoR DrAkOn that would be fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 50 - chaos effects are reduced 10%&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Poor.&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Avoiding corruption is very important in this game, but the reason for the low grade is firstly that at level 50 game is almost over anyway, and secondly that 10% is not a whole lot at all. It will help against corrupting hits from monsters, and from using elemental orbs, but it may have no effect on background corrution at all, as this occurs gradually over time and the 10% reduction gets lost when rounding. Unless mabye you are on Emperor moloch level or ChAoS plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;III. Starting up the monk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. Starting equipment&lt;br /&gt;A monk always starts out with a robe. Trollish have extra food and start with a heavy club equipped, the other races have a quarterstaff in inventory. Many races have sandals. Some may have tools. Robe and sandals can have +DV or +PV modifiers, but base is [0,+1] robe and [0,0] sandals. One lucky character I had started with [+3,+2]robe and [0,+2] sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b. Starsigns&lt;br /&gt;As monks are passable magicians in addition to being great fighters, both «brain» and «brawn» type starsigns are fine. Some starsigns that work particularly well with monk class:&lt;br /&gt;Dragon: +strength is good for avoiding burden status.&lt;br /&gt;Cup: Enhances the monk's already decent magic ability, also makes levelling faster which makes the level-related abilities come sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Candle: Speedy healing combined with monk's bonus to movement equals being hard to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c. Races&lt;br /&gt;Races have effect on starting equipment, starting attributes, starting skillset, experience table and certain other factors. Skills listed are those not covered by monk class, doubly-trained skills are not listed. Lifespan I consider to be generic to any class and is not discussed. I will also not discuss Ap and Ch stats as I consider them mostly useless, and not connected to the monk class in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human:&lt;br /&gt;Race skills: swimming and food preservation.&lt;br /&gt;Starting attributes: Very average.&lt;br /&gt;Level up: Fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Food preservation is good for all races, mabye somewhat less since monks have less food consumption. Swimming means that you could go for an early dive into the unremarkable dungeon without having to turn back when faced with a river. Fast levelup is extra good as a monk character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troll:&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Gemology, mining, food preservation and bridge building.&lt;br /&gt;Starting attributes: High strength and toughness. Low everything else, especially learning and mana.&lt;br /&gt;Level up: Slowest by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Starting attributes leads itself to playing the monk as a melee fighter. Highest strength means burden levels will be little problem, and high toughness will give some +PV to make the easy game easy. Mining skill is useless as you can kick walls, but gemology means that you can kick walls for unlimited gems once you reach level 13, for example in the ID. This will take care of any money problem as well as giving gems like health, fire and of knowledge. These crystals of knowledge will likewise take care of problems with low learning. Food preservation is somewhat better for trolls as they have higher food consumption. A troll monk is about as hungry as a regular adventurer.&lt;br /&gt;The big drawback is the terrible experience tables, bad for a monk who wants to be as high level as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Elf/Grey Elf&lt;br /&gt;Skills: None&lt;br /&gt;Starting attributes: Lower St and To, higher Ma and Le.&lt;br /&gt;Level up: Normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Potentially a mighty character, elves start out weak and must be careful in the beginning game. If you find spellbooks you can probably read them and cast spells from the moment you find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Elf&lt;br /&gt;Skills: None&lt;br /&gt;Starting attributes: Like other elves&lt;br /&gt;Level up: Normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Pretty much same as high/grey elves. Dark elves are liked for their excellent skillset, but this is wasted on monks who cover the skills already. Bad shop prices in dwarftown is about as bad for monks as anyone else - you are not able to sell SI for as much money, which means slower precrowns and less gold to buy stats from Garth. Buying items is never much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dwarf&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Metallurgy, Mining, Smithing, Detect traps.&lt;br /&gt;Starting attributes: Higher St and To, lower Le and Ma.&lt;br /&gt;Level up: Slow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Smithing and detect traps are available in the game, but will save the character the gold to buy them. Detect traps is one of the most important skills in the game and helps with early-game survival. Metallurgy is useless as you can test most items by attempting to smith on them if you do not know what they are made of. Mining is useless for a monk. Dwarves can get the mithril skin talent, which will make up for lack of PV that can come from not using shield and heavy armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gnome&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Gemology, Mining, Pick pockets, Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Starting attributes: Lower St, Higher mana.&lt;br /&gt;Level up: Fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion: Gemology means that you can kick walls for unlimited gems once you reach level 13, for example in the ID. This will take care of any money problem as well as giving important gems of health, power, fire and knowledge. Knowledge in particular are good, as they allow Gnomes to become excellent magic-users once they find some books. Ventriloquism combined with high running speed will also make the gnome monk safer. Fast level up is nice, and the free talent will give some flexibility to the early game, making it easier. A very solid choice for monk, if only a little weak in the very early game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d. Talents&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has certain favourite talents. I will discuss some that relate directly to the monk class. In my opinion, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;”Carrying talents”: Porter - Master Packager - Beast of Burden&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent talents for monks, because of burdened status giving penalties. 72% extra carrying capacity is simply very useful, and I have yet to play a monk who did not get these talents at one point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PV talents: (Hardy) - Tough skin - Iron skin - Steel skin - (Mithril skin)&lt;br /&gt;These are good for monks, as they make up for not having PV from shield and heavy armor. They will make early game manageable, especially for the frail races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money-giving talents:&lt;br /&gt;Useless, as you have no starting gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shield talents:&lt;br /&gt;Not necessarily useless, as Monks can be played with weapons. Shields will eliminate the nifty martial arts damage bonus, so you have to be wielding a one-handed weapon to use shields. You will of course also lose the DV-bonus, but the shield bonus should more than compensate for this. If you plan on fighting like any regular character, these talents are as strong as usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heir:&lt;br /&gt;Terrible. The heir gift is Padded clean robe of defense. That means a [+4,+1] (ap+2) robe which grants stun resistance. This is not something anyone should waste 3 talents on, especially as it is susceptible to destruction from burning and exploding runes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e. Getting equipped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning game (level 1-12):&lt;br /&gt;As a fresh monk you will face an important question: To fight barehanded or use a weapon. Remember that Monks are not penalized for weapon use like Beastfighters are. Deciding to use a weapon actually has several advantages: All weapon skills give better bonuses than barehanded fighting, and you can use a shield for DV and PV if you picked a one-handed weapon like you should. More importantly, you can become burdened without severe penalty to your attack and damage. This is important for instance if you decide to dive down through the UD to HMV, as you can carry that bag of loot to sell at the shop. At the very start your martial art bonus is not too high, as your level will be too low. However, by using a weapon you lose training in barehanded combat. Also, if you happen to wield a cursed weapon it may not be trivial to remove it in the very beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to the starting monk is to pick up at least some weapons for emergency use. If you suddenly get burdened, this will allow you to deal decent damage even if your unarmed fighting suddenly dropped to a pathetic level. And if you find a decent shield early on, you would probably want to wield a weapon and wear the shield. This will really help you survive the harsh early game. You will only lose some unarmed melee marks, as you can throw off the weapon and the shield anytime you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for armor, your special DV bonus from light armor will be very low, and you will probably be better off with the typical PV armor most characters seek. When you get to higher levels, factor in the hidden DV bonus when comparing armor. If you are, for example, level 9, compare a robe [0,+1] to a studded leather armor [-1,+3]. If you put on the robe you get an additional 2/3*9=6 DV. Which would you then rather have, a [+6,+1] or a [-1,+3] armor? That would probably depend on your other equipment, if your "basic" PV is covered through other equipment then high DV is probably better. Again, burdened status will remove the bonus, so maybe you should hang on to the PV one…just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning game, as usual, hoard any scrolls and potions till you can identify them. Be on the lookout for girdles, footwear, headwear and gauntlets, as you can wear these freely and still have all monkish benefits. Girdles of carrying (thick girdle) are also very useful to you, just be wary of putting on a cursed one. Any books you find should be saved until you have 100 literacy and concentration, and personally I would probably save them until I had over 20 learning, which should be in the mid-game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mid-Late game (level 13-50).&lt;br /&gt;Having survived the harsh early years, this is where the monk starts to shine. You will gather several artifacts, and will enjoy watching your damage output rise every level. DV from light armor is almost always too good to pass up, unless you found something really nice like eternium plate or some dragon scale armor. The mid-game is where you have plenty of time to gather equipment which will help you win. There is no clear distinction between mid and late game, because after you have all the stuff, you can just knock off the Ancient Chaos Wyrm, and then complete the game in what you wear, letting levelups increase your damage and DV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly advise that you employ smithing. As a monk you have access to unlimited ore, just by kicking in walls. Getting a hammer is trivial, getting an anvil can be done by cutting a deal with the greater demon, having it slay the dwarven smith. Just remember to buy the smithing skill first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some items to be on the watch for:&lt;br /&gt;Body armor: If you find or get crowned with any of the monk artifact armors (shirt of the saints, robes of resistance) they will probably serve you well enough. For the not-so-lucky monks there exists a very decent alternative: Elven chain mail. This armor starts out at [0,+5], but is fully smithable and made from mithril. Added to this, it only weighs 10s. Perfect for any monk. You might find one in darkforge if none drop randomly for you. Eternium plate mails or dragon scale armor have a big enough PV bonus that they are desirable for all but very high-leveled monks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handwear: Elemental gauntlets are not very hard to get, and good hand wear for the +3 PV and resistances. If you have resistances covered elsewhere, some smithed-up gauntlets (of strength, preferably) could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neckwear: The Ankh adds [+2,+2], and luck too. Carry other amulets for use in certain situations, as always. Artifact amulet is of course your dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girdle, Boots, Helmet: Get high-metal versions of these. If you smith like you should, is it a good idea to get different types of metal for each. Eternium girdle, adamantium cap and mithril boots, for example. It doesn't matter much, they all resist fire and they can be smithed up as high as you want them to be. You may of course have some seven league boots, but they might not be the best choice in the tower of fire where you are going. Also, monks already get good movement speed from class powers, and the boots do not add attack speed. Boots of speed, however, do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracers: My recent favorite is bracers of speed. They add a nice little speed boost, and they are made of iron and can be smithed up. As a monk, you hit hard, and they might help you use hit and run tactics, or get in two quick fight-finishing strikes before your opponent can react. Waterproofing them with blessed oil of rust removal is useful. Bracers of toughness add that important attribute, and they can be improved with scrolls of defense/protection. Bracers of War is every monk's wet dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rings: A blessed ring of damage on your right finger is, indeed, a blessing. Monks have just one damage die, which can lead to low minimum damage even at high levels. Weapon skill, strength bonus and rings of damage all push this lower limit upwards. For other ring finger good choices are really what is good for any class. With the monks' low food consumption they might get away with wearing a ring of invisibility all the time. Ultimate rings are of course ring of immunity and the ring of the master cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloak: You can wear them all without penalty. Invisibility might be easier to sustain than with other classes, and PV might be better than DV since you already get so much DV, but that is depending on your level and your other equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missile weapons: Bows might be better, if only for the high weight of crossbows. But I would still at least keep and stash away both kinds of missiles and launchers, hoping for rare slaying ammo. Humanoid and dragon slaying are your most important kinds of ammo. However after level 13 you have a source of unlimited sling ammo or thrown rocks, so it might not be too bad an idea to train with that either, for the early middle game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tool: The first orb you find goes here, and most melee monks will put the fire orb as soon as possible, unless they already have Herculean strength. Before or after you have access to orbs, a lit torch will improve your sight-radius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IV How to play the monk&lt;br /&gt;a. Playing style&lt;br /&gt;Part 1. - The Mean Machine&lt;br /&gt;“mean is the "standard" average”&lt;br /&gt;-wikipedia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mean Machine - mean as in “average”, is my name for playing your monk without using his special abilities, like you would any other class. This is done by picking up a weapon, and then using a shield. Staying in burdened status will also do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfectly reasonable playing style. You get the fine monk skills, the reduced food consumption, and the reduced movement at level 12 and 18, the critical hit class-powers and the increase in speed. Every monk might use this style from time to time, in the early game, when suddenly becoming burdened or when finding a great one-handed weapon. If I find executor I *will* become the Mean Machine unless sworn to play as a true hand-to-hand monk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 2. - The Ninja&lt;br /&gt;"Sword and mind must be united. Technique by itself is insufficient, and spirit alone is not enough."&lt;br /&gt;- Yamada Jirokichi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This playing style is a cross between regular weapon-using character and the martial artist. By not using a shield or heavy armor, you retain your great boost to DV. At the same time you can use any weapon or combination of weapons with deadly efficiency. Other characters will usually have a very low DV when wielding a two-handed weapon, but the Ninja does not. Carry with you a wide array of weapons, to dispose of your various foes with maximum efficiency. Two-handed wielding is generally not recommended, but you can do it just fine playing as a ninja. Avoid getting burdened by having great strength or using the strength of atlas spell. Or both. Again, advantages are your skillset, class-powers and increased speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 3. - The Martial Artist&lt;br /&gt;"A one sided martial artist is a blind martial artist."&lt;br /&gt;-unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Martial Artist is probably the most traditional fighting style for a monk. Unarmed attacks will be used throughout the game. You may use light armor for DV boost or heavy for protection and other benefits. Your focus on barehanded attacks only means that you quickly gain weapon marks. This is a character for people who do not trust the RNG (random number generator) as they are not relying on lucky equipment finds. You can fight barehanded and naked and still be king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some opponents that may cause grievance to a pure weaponless fighter. Ancient stone beast is a tough nut to crack, with its heavy armor. You can still rely on raw damage to bring him down, or use construct slaying ammo. Emperor moloch is another juggernaut, demon or humanoid slaying ammo will do the job. Another way to bring him down comes if you are over level 40. You can keep hitting him in melee until you get an insta-killing hit. Not something to rely on as you could wait a long time, but extremely satisfying when it finally happens. The ElDeR ChAoS god can be melee'd, but when he dies you must be wielding a certain trident, otherwise something bad might happen. Use slaying ammo to finish him off if you for some reason choose not to ever use a weapon in melee. Easier solution to all these examples are of course to use a penetrating weapon (phase dagger or other) when attacking high-PV monsters, and of course to wield the certain trident once you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 4. - The Hermit&lt;br /&gt;“The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.”&lt;br /&gt;- Eden Phillpott&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all monks can use magic for adventuring support or even as a backup attack, the hermit will attempt to use magic as a wizard does. This is not to mean as main attack, but rather as the preferred way to take down problematic encounters. Even wizards kill most of their enemies in melee, but when faced with a greater undead vault, they will certainly use their high-powered magical abilities. This is what the hermit is about, when the going gets tough, the magic starts flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To become a successful hermit, one must realize one’s limitations. I will point these out by comparing to the wizard class.&lt;br /&gt;A wizard will start the game with an offensive spellbook. Hermit will not.&lt;br /&gt;A wizard has 100 starting literacy, hermits do not. A wizard learns spells easier than an otherwise identical hermit. Literacy skill, learning score, concentration skill as well as class matters. A wizard gets reductions on spell cost with level. Wizards gain spell marks quicker than any hermit.&lt;br /&gt;Also, wizards find a lot more spellbooks than a hermit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you will never be as good as a wizard. But there are ways to become mighty in the arts. First, choose a race with decent magic potential. Any elf will do, or try a gnome. There is also some starsigns that are more magical than others. Then, realize that you will not be using magic for a while. Thirdly, while fighting as any other monk through your early levels, build up your literacy and concentration skill. Literacy can be trained by getting the scrolls from SMC. One will vanish if you use it outside that area, but the scribbled scroll you can read over and over. It will seem to be empty, but you will train your skill. Concentration is not that easy, you pick it up as you level up. Zapping wands of wonder will take away PP, making it easier to train the skill. Next, get good magical talents. Book learner talents, charged talent, maybe strong magic/healing. If you are fortunate enough to find an early book, resist the temptation to read it too soon. 100 literacy, good concentration and high learning are all essential. You have a limited supply of books, so take care of the ones you find. It is best to ID the books before you read them, and save the tough books for later. You may want to start reading and casting non-vital non-offensive spells right away, to build up concentration skill and mana stat. Bless important books to maximize yield. Elves have good learning, and if you started playing a gnome, then you of course build learning by kicking walls after level 13. Your gemology skill will sometimes let you find gems in the walls, higher skill means more gems. Bless and use crystals of knowledge and your learning will rise above 20 fast enough. If you are not shy about using sickness/starvation to train stats, it is not hard to get it to 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem is finding enough spellbooks. If you do not care to spend long hours scumming for items (walking around the ID, killing endless gremlins) then you should plan on visiting the Rift and entering the hidden library. This can not be done before you reach level 20, but that may be the time it takes to prepare for your spell-casting days. The library usually has dangerous monsters, so having emergency teleportation and/or healing is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b. Sample walkthroughs&lt;br /&gt;A traditional start:&lt;br /&gt;Started up a random race monk. Grey elf. Potentially great, but slow at start, so I decide to take it pretty slow. Start with 3 talents, but unable to select “hardy” for defense. Go with long stride, porter and alert. Go to the village and get quests, then village dungeon. Quicly get level 2, but have to retreat and heal up from time to time. At level 4 I have to use a prayer. Still, I can run whenever I want, due to long stride and + speed from levelup. Not much, but enough. I have to be very careful in combat, with 7 To. I try not to become satiated, as that kills my speed advantage. I do pretty good damage now, but am very weak in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A look at the character: Level 5 now. 1d13+3 damage dealt. At normal tactics, no DV from eq I have 16 DV. Speed is +3, but I stupidly got satiated, and due to monks low metabolism I have waited a long while for it to drop back to normal. I have picked up some rocks and am busy trying to improve that skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a studded leather armor [-1,+3] gives us a choice. To wear or not. This very weak character will wear it, giving up +3 DV for +2PV, but it is close to a draw. If it is cursed we might not be able to remove it for a while, even if we would like to because our level-up DV is better. Also, it is heavy at 250 s, taking up precious carrying capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder, I quickly am faced with the question whether to become burdened or not. I decide to go ahead, because I just lost the DV bonus anyway (the armor was, of course, cursed), and with 13 strength I would like to train it by walking around carrying a heavy load. Also, a nice orc scorcher donated a crude spear I want to start using. My barehanded attack skill is only 2, no extra damage, so I would end up doing 1d3+0 if I attack barehanded while burdened. Guess I can do it against weak enemies to train barehanded, but on the other hand I see many uses of training polearms too. If the spear had been cursed I would be stuck with it, but that would not be a crisis. Holy water will become available, and the spear will be good enough for a fair while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enter D:7. And my advice at this point is to just enter the level to generate the druid, and come back after you have a few more levels. Level 6, 4PV, still weak attack. Come back at level 9-10 and everything will be better, weapons skill, speed, martial damage. I therefore decide to set out to destroy the evil druid and (hopefully) die, proving my point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And true to plan - “Trad. L7 gray elven monk (M). 5766 xps. 4157 turns. He was killed by a cave bear in a sinister dungeon on level 7.” Don’t make this mistake, enter D:7, leave and grow a little stronger. I would recommend CoC, actually. Go down to arena, maybe a bit further, pick up lightweight food (you only need half as much) and pray for some early herbs. If so, stabilize the herbs, go back and finish the druid, and use your new-gained herbalism to reap the rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next try - fast &amp; furious approach.&lt;br /&gt;Started up a drakeling monk. 18 St and 17 To, a bit disappointing. Only one talent so I take long stride. Went immediately to SMC. Got to level 3, found downstairs. I got hurt a fair bit, but had prayers in reserve. Decided not to use spit, to prove that this can be done with any (somewhat strong) race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then have to bite back those words - a herd of blink dogs appear. They fall to acid spit, drop a corpse. I think a troll monk could have taken them, but this guy would have died horribly without the spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At level 5, I see that I can train athletics to 72. I go for it even if it wastes some training, knowing that it will give +1 speed now. Remember the breakpoints, 70, 75, 80, 85 etc gives +1 each, 100 gives +2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the character died too. I got him sick by carelessness, and then he swam a river to encounter summoned spiders. Might have fought his way out, but I have a guide to write here! Monks have excellent survival skills for this kind of early rush, especially the drakeling. A trip through the UD will typically yield vaults, shops and herbs. Speed-playing the monk is a viable tactic, and killing high-risk monsters quickly will boost your level giving you more killing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c. Defeating special opponents&lt;br /&gt;Monsters not mentioned here are not worth mentioning, either because they are too easy, or they are killed with stock-tactics and no special monk skills apply, or I forgot them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keriax, the Black Druid, is often the first special enemy encountered. The problem with him is that his monster level will be connected to your character’s level. Monks have no special attacks at the start, and their ability comes very much from character level. If you wait to be powerful, he will be more powerful too. So, either be a strong fighter race, or have luck finding stuff you can use against him (wands, spells) or use the simple but effective tactic of entering his level early, leave, and come back when you are stronger. Then you can laugh at his puny skills before dispatching him “mit eleganz”. The artifact is not generated when you enter the level, just when you kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yulgash, the Master Summoner, gets a spot here, too. If you wait till you are above character level 25, you can use your switch places with hostile opponents-ability to get close and personal to him, and end his summoning capers right there and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emperor Moloch is armored like a tank (200 PV). He will take a lot of critical hits with barehanded to croak. I suggest alternative tactics on him. Blessed demon/humanoid slaying ammo if you play a pure martial artist, otherwise penetrating or a big demon slayer. Rune-covered trident could work fine against him, and you’d have high DV if you were smart enough to be unburdened for the fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elder Chaos God. You have to be wielding the trident while killing him. Humanoid slaying for style, otherwise bash him with the trident. Or scepter, if you took that route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;During the process of writing this guide, I have grown more fond of the monk class. Versatile, and with many unique abilities, they can easily become mighty, and are at least fun to play. I wish all potential monks out there luck with their attempts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credits:&lt;br /&gt;Silfir, for starting up the guides thus leading to this coming into being.&lt;br /&gt;Soirana, for making a guide from which I borrowed some headings and general ideas.&lt;br /&gt;F50 for making the direct request for this guide.&lt;br /&gt;J. for providing the info about martial attack bonus&lt;br /&gt;Kevin O’Connor for making the list on martial art bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Hilter, Darren Grey, Silfir, Soirana, Nightmare, gut, J., for various input about the guide.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/5328998422940404822/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=5328998422940404822' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/5328998422940404822'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/5328998422940404822'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2008/05/guide-to-being-monk-by-molach.html' title='The Guide to Being a Monk by Molach'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3710148354194913408.post-9119215138464115358</id><published>2008-05-02T17:29:00.008+02:00</published><updated>2008-05-02T18:05:45.503+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='guide'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='druid'/><title type='text'>Guide to Being a Druid</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;2008 has been rather slow up until now, but we are not actively pursuing a stable update schedule or something like that. Updates will come when I have been given something to update with or, as the case may be, when I have produced something myself yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for some of the fifth and last section. As I wrote most of it between one and three in the morning, it may have turned out rather silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are slowly making our way to completing a collection of guides for every one of the twenty classes. For this, it is necessary that some of us tackle guides of classes that neither sound too hot nor are, quite frankly, any remarkable. That said, these classes tend to become a delightful experience for their mediocricy, simply because you're not as much under pressure while playing them. If you manage to lose with a high elven archer, or with an orcish barbarian, people (okay, some people) will ridicule you, because it is OH SO EASY to play with them. But if you try to play a dwarven druid and succeed, the same people will nod appreciatively in recognition of your skill! Which is what we all aim for, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is why I wrote this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUIDE TO PLAYING A DRUID IN ADOM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual Information - The part which takes the least effort.&lt;br /&gt;II. Starting up the Druid - Anything that should be considered before even the first step.&lt;br /&gt;III. Playing style - What's your druid going to do a priest can't do better?&lt;br /&gt;IV. Equipment - What you should use, what you should get&lt;br /&gt;V. Monster Bash - Hints on how to seriously kick asses even as a Druid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRUIDS -- Druids are nature priests.  They worship the Old Gods and regard all nature as a holy thing to worship and protect.  Their specialty are spells of nature and protection.  It is said that no animal will willingly harm a druid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Druids are trained in the following skills: Climbing, Concentration, First Aid, Gardening, Healing, Herbalism, Listening, Literacy, Survival, Swimming, and Woodcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At higher levels, druids become extremely attuned to nature itself. At level 6 they learn to evade wilderness encounters whenever they choose to do so.  At level 12 they regenerate power points twice as fast as usual while in the wilderness.  At level 18 they become immune to all weather effects.  At level 25 they are able to summon 1d3 major animals as servants at the cost of 1d3 mana points (an almost permanent loss, as it only regenerates after a very long period of time).  At level 32 they regenerate hit points twice as fast as usual while in the wilderness.  At level 40 they become immune to lightning. Finally, they suffer 10% less corruption from all such attacks at level 50 due to their close connection to nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II. Starting up the Druid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Starsigns&lt;br /&gt;First of all, an obvious vote for Candle. Why Candle? Because its effect is greater than that of maxed out HP regeneration. Because it is greater than the effect of a maxed Healing skill. And because all of this added makes you near invincible, even if you decide to play a Druid. Raven is good for the extra speed and for the possibility to get a very powerful artifact quite early. Since Druids are spellcasters, and always start out neutral, the Wand starsign is an obvious benefit, as is Cup (less so, because going up in levels quickly won't help a Druid that much). Salamander helps with its extra mana and its bonus to fire spells; to a limited extent, as Druids almost never start out with fire spells. The benefit of the Unicorn starsign, like that of Candle, is independent from the class chosen, and useful if you are especially paranoid about corruption. Extra willpower offered by the Tree starsign and the Wolf starsign is mildly helpful for spellcasters, but great willpower becomes really important only later on, after the acquirement of ball spells, and regardless of the starsign willpower is unlikely to start at values so high that the ever-popular morgia roots can't replicate the effect and add even more willpower. Dragon and Sword can be useful depending on your playing style. A Druid who casts only spells all the time will make less use of these starsigns than a Druid using mostly melee and missile weapons, casting spells as support. Falcon is pretty bad, as it adds a skill Druids already have, and the extra talent is provided by Candle as well, in addition to the most overpowered starsign effect of all. Lastly, the Book starsign is probably not that bad a deal, especially early on when Druids struggle a bit with their relatively (for a spellcaster) low Literacy skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to recap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible: Falcon&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Wolf, Tree&lt;br /&gt;Okay: Book, Dragon, Sword, Unicorn&lt;br /&gt;Good: Wand, Cup, Raven, Salamander&lt;br /&gt;Almost cheating: Candle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Races of ADOM trying to be Druids&lt;br /&gt;There are more consistencies among Druids of the different races than there are usually among the classes. Druids all have four things in common at least: A wooden shield and a spellbook of Divine Wrath, the clerical version of Lightning Bolt, as well as exactly two random potions. Apart from that, they are similar in a preference for blunt weapons (elves posing the exception) and light armor, in contrast to priests, who oftentimes wear heavy armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Human&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Leather armor, light cloak, cudgel OR quarterstaff, sandals, wooden shield, fire-making stuff, two random potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some other spellbook, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Extra spellbook, decent Learning&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Only one skill added, low Mana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Humans are the epitome of mediocricy. They neither make exceptionally good fighters nor are they remarkable spellcasters. Ironically, that fits with the Druid, who also doesn't exactly excel at either early on. The one advantage of the human race is their Learning bonus. This actually benefits a Druid well, as it increases his ability to learn spells. Don't rely on them too much; your mana is average at best. All in all, the human is not the worst choice, but not a terribly good one either, especially because of their lousy skillset. The extra book can help tremendously on occasion, though, especially if it's a spellbook of Cure Light Wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Troll&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Athletics, Bridge Building, Food Preservation, Gemology, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Hood, thick furs, light cloak, heavy club, wooden shield, some random potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some more food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Extremely strong and tough, nice array of skills&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Troll leveling requirements and troll metabolism, horrible spellcasting abilities, short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Hugely dependant on playing style and personal preferences. Generally, all trolls are united in the disadvantage of their slow, slow leveling. When you reach level 2, another character would have reached level 4 or 5, and when another character would be at level 50, you're still struggling with the thirties. This isn't as bad as it sounds, as you get unbelievable strength and toughness stats in exchange, meaning you'll be at least as sturdy in battle as a non-troll with the same experience. Especially in the beginning you will pretty much crush everything in your path, leading to easy survival. You do gain access to Druid class powers a lot later - you can ignore that since Druid class powers are craptastic. Bad is the fact that you'll learn much slower, especially skills and spells. Your Literacy skill will start terribly low, and will take a long time to increase with only three skill advances per level. The Gemology skill is thus of terrible importance. Why? Check its skill description to find out! Also note that all the skills (with the exception of Bridge Building) are very useful. Trolls are reasonable Druids, if you can handle their obvious disadvantages (not helping matters is the increased food consumption).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) High Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Dodge, Stealth&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Hood, leather armor, light cloak, scimitar, leather boots, wooden shield, some random potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good spellcasting abilities including good Learning, nice skills, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Rather low toughness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This is definitely not a bad choice. High Elves don't get many skills, but this time they do fill some holes in the Druid repertoire: Dodge adds some staying power in melee, and the Stealth skill is a minor, but all-time help to any adventurer, and required to receive a very valuable, though unreadable, artifact book. Thus, even though strength is average and toughness is low, with your scimitar, leather armor and wooden shield you should be able to use melee to some extent. The Learning score is equalled only by the Gray Elf, and your Mana score will be high enough to kick some ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Gray Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Dodge, Stealth&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Hood, leather armor, light cloak, scimitar, leather boots, wooden shield, some random potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Excellent spellcasting abilities thanks to good Learning and Mana, nice skills, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very low toughness, low health regeneration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Compared to the high elf, playing a gray elf increases the tradeoff of toughness and HP regeneration in exchange for spellcasting abilities (Learning's the same, though). Whether this is to your liking or not is up to you (it's to mine), there is not much in the way of differences between the two races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Dark Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Alertness, Find Weakness, Stealth&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Hood, leather armor, light cloak, scimitar, leather boots, wooden shield, some random potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Excellent skills, decent spellcasting abilities, high Mana, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low toughness, low PV, low health regeneration, average Learning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Let's make no mistake about it - the skills you would get as a dark elf are very, very tempting. Getting Alertness and Find Weakness is definitely the better deal compared to getting Dodge. However, Dark elves have the disadvantage of starting with a low Learning score compared to the other elves. This puts a limit on their early spellcasting, when Literacy is yet low and you don't get many castings from your few early-found spellbooks. Besides, the Find Weakness skill only kicks in if you're using weapons, while the Druid is pretty much a primary spellcaster later on. However, everybody has to fight in melee at some point, and Find Weakness can help a lot. I'd call this one of the best choices for Druid overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Dwarf&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Detect Traps, Metallurgy, Mining, Smithing&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Studded leather armor, hooded cloak, heavy cudgel, heavy boots, wooden shield, some random potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Decent strength and toughness&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low Mana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: The humble dwarf makes for a decent druid, though not a terribly powerful one. His high strength and toughness and his rather sturdy starting equipment will make the early game rather easy. Dwarves have an okay Learning score, making them halfway decent spell learners, but rather low Mana, meaning they won't be able to cast as many spells in a given tough situation. Still, worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Gnome&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Gemology, Mining, Pick Pockets, Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Leather armor, hooded cloak, club, wooden shield, fire-making equipment, some random potions, spellbook of divine wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good mana, nice skills&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low strength, a club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: There's not really much negative to say about the gnomish Druid. However, unless you want the skills, there's also not much of a reason to play one. True, they're tougher than elves while possessing a fair degree of magical talent, on the other hand, toughness isn't that much of an issue with relatively high starting PV and the Healing skill, considering the existence of morgia roots. The fact you gain experience faster isn't really an issue, considering the overall suckiness of the class powers you would get quicker. Still, his skills, especially Gemology, are very nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Hurthling&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Archery, Cooking, Food Preservation, Stealth&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: leather cap, leather armor, leather girdle, hooded cloak, club, cursed ring, wooden shield, fire-making equipment, cooking set, some potions, spellbook of divine wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice skills, good dexterity, good at throwing rocks&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Horrible strength AND horrible mana, a club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Hm. Well. An adventurer who hits like a tiny girl and can't spellcast his way out of a paper bag. Why would anyone in their right mind consider playing a hurthling Druid? Well, they have an interesting array of skills, including the Archery skill, which opens up the way for some excellent Archery talents. They also have Food Preservation and Stealth, and are even the only race with that particular combination. Depending on your skill preferences, you might play a hurthling Druid. If it's not for the skills or the awesome rock-throwing, stay away from this race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Orc&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Backstabbing, Find Weakness, Metallurgy, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Studded leather armor, leather girdle, hooded cloak, quarterstaff, heavy boots, wooden shield, some potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice strength, toughness and starting PV, Find Weakness&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Short lifespan, sucky spellcaster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Okay. Studded leather armor, wooden shield and heavy boots combined with the high strength and toughness expand on your capability of surviving the early game. On the other hand, you should avoid learning spells for some time until you have successfully worked on your Learning and Literacy. Sadly, you don't have the Gemology skill to support you in that regard. Choose this race if you want some melee prowess and the Find Weakness skill, though all in all, a dwarf will probably turn out to be the better choice, because he doesn't suck so much at spellcasting and has the same equipment and stat advantages, lacking only Find Weakness - again, druids are pretty much spellcasters later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Drakeling&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Alertness, Food Preservation, Music&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Robe, leather girdle, hooded cloak, quarterstaff, bracers of defense, wooden shield, some potions, spellbook of Divine Wrath, some food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice strength and toughness, good skills and racial ability&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low PV, mediocre spellcasting abilities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Another interesting choice. This is the only race starting without some sort of leather armor, though; you'll even start with the lowest PV of all. Drakelings are used to being treated this way, and can counter this well through their racial ability. Seeing as you don't have much Mana to work with, this will add to your early game survival chances. Nice skills to tempt you, that's for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;As you may have seen, there is no definite right and wrong regarding choice of Druid race. In fact, regardless of what you choose, there will always be some tradeoff skillwise or statwise. There are a lot of skills Druids don't usually have which are offered by races. Surviving the early game is always doable with a Druid thanks to their relatively sturdy starting equipment - most Druids begin the game with at least 3 points of PV including the shield -, the Healing skill and the Divine Wrath spell. If pressed for an answer, I'd probably vote for a gray elven Druid. This is because that gives you the best spellcasting abilities you can get, enabling you to make full use of your spellcasting all the earlier. A dark elven Druid is good if you want a challenge, it will pay off later thanks to their skills. If I were to play a Druid concentrating on melee early on, I'd probably go with a dwarf, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Choosing a gender&lt;br /&gt;You will probably wonder why the hell this should be important. Did you think you could make a decision in startup that wouldn't have consequences? Yes you can, but that one is the decision on your name. Your gender choice is a decision with minor consequences, but consequences nonetheless. These are the criteria:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) The stat bonus&lt;br /&gt;Choosing a gender will yield a certain stat bonus. Male characters start out with an extra point of strength, while female characters gain an extra point of dexterity. Which of these do you want? Considering that strength directly influences carrying capacity and every ADOM character is likely to walk around with lots of stuff, it could be called the more important stat of the two. On the other hand, dexterity has an influence on DV and speed, which is very handy, and melee damage granted by strength isn't as important for a spellcaster as it would be for a melee class. However, strength is harder to increase in general, and more strength means you can carry more stuff without advancing to the next burdening status, which would impose penalties on the same DV and speed! Walking around in Strained! mode will increase it to 18 or 19 eventually, regardless of the potential maximum; but higher than that you get only with arduous and expensive training or potions of strength. Dexterity, on the other hand, is very easy to increase to values of at least 25 with herbs, and employing several tricks you can increase it to 30 with the same method. However, until you HAVE found herbs, dexterity is likely to stay where it is in the beginning. So which one of the two is preferable? There is no single right answer. The limit of 19, as has been stated, can be reached with a simple form of training available to anyone right from the start. Trolls will start out higher than that usually, so the extra point of strength granted by playing a male trollish Druid is not easy to gain otherwise. On the other hand, trolls are so strong they are unlikely to have problems with carrying capacity. Wouldn't they be better served by a minor improvement on their subpar dexterity stat then? On yet another hand, a single point of dexterity makes a lot less difference than a single point of strength, doesn't it? Then again, dexterity cannot be trained early on until the right kind of herb is found, while you can start training strength right away, if you so desire!&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me, that one stat point isn't really that important. It's well within the range of the randomness every character has concerning his stats. Whether you prefer the extra point of strength or dexterity certainly is a question of playing style, but you should rather choose your Druid's gender according to the other criteria available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Shopping&lt;br /&gt;All shopkeepers in the game are males. All shopkeepers in the game are pretty lonely males. If you have a shop in the darkest corners of a dungeon wondering whether you should have interpreted the claims of a "lively business environment" or "hordes of customers who would kill to obtain your high quality merchandise" differently, you don't see a lot of, well, booty. We all can understand and appreciate the shopkeeper's plight, can't we? Considering ADOM playing geeks are male in majority and themselves don't see a lot of... Ahem. Understandably, the shopkeepers' brains all shut down once they pick up hints that the adventurer who entered their shop is, under all those layers of armor, dust, dirt and blood, in fact female. This leads to the fortunate effect that once they catch a glimpse of your well-endowed rack and the amazing curves of your slender body, your long, luscious hair, and this fascinating smile that would shame the clearest, sunniest and bluest skies, they will immediately do anything to make your shopping experience as delightful as possible, including and fortunately limited to low prices. It also leads to the unfortunate effect that if they see you and think you're ugly (your troll teeth with the pieces of rotten human flesh inbetween or the orcish stench of foul eggs ticking them off), they will be hasty to get rid of you. How dare you destroy their fantasies of gorgeous women they might be able to meet once they have made a fortune in their secluded dungeon shop! That's why you will get ridiculous prices if you're playing an ugly female. (Even Waldenbrook and Munxip, who don't live in forlorn dungeons, but civilized settlements, seem to be desperate to see some hot stuff. Apparently, dwarves really don't have any women and human goodwives aren't such a lovely sight...)&lt;br /&gt;Male characters don't get prices calculated on that basis. Instead, the more winning the attitude of the male, the lower the prices they get. The more unpleasant and rude, the higher the prices get. Yeah, it's pretty shocking. Considering how people nowadays generally behave in shops, you wonder why they don't have to pay tons of gp more for every insult they throw at the poor shopkeeping slaves. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;The short version of all this: While shop prices are calculated on your appearance stat if you're female, they are calculated on the basis of charisma if you're male.&lt;br /&gt;Druids gain neither a penalty nor a bonus to their charisma and appearance stats. The races, however, do. This means that the choice of gender based on this criterium is made on the basis of your race. If you're a race with higher appearance than charisma, go female. If you're a race with higher charisma than appearance, go male. If your race has approximately equal stats in both, let yourself be guided by other criteria. Here is a list of the races' basic stats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human: 10 App versus 10 Cha = Doesn't matter&lt;br /&gt;Troll: 6 Cha versus 5 App = Doesn't matter much&lt;br /&gt;High Elf: 10 Cha versus 14 App = Go female&lt;br /&gt;Gray Elf: 8 Cha versus 18 App = Go female under any circumstance&lt;br /&gt;Dark Elf: 7 Cha versus 12 App = Go female&lt;br /&gt;Dwarf: 9 Cha versus 9 App = Doesn't matter&lt;br /&gt;Gnome: 12 Cha versus 10 App = Go male&lt;br /&gt;Hurthling: 12 Cha versus 10 App = Go male&lt;br /&gt;Orc: 8 Cha versus 7 App = Doesn't matter much&lt;br /&gt;Drakeling: 10 Cha versus 8 App = Go male&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this looks very easy, but there is more to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Appearance is very likely to take a very serious drop once the endgame is approached. The majority of corruptions affect Appearance, and all of these affect Appearance negatively. This means that female characters will get very bad prices once they gather sufficient corruptions. On the other hand, there are only two corruptions that affect Charisma negatively, meaning males will have a higher chance of getting good shop prices in the endgame. That said, prices generally don't matter in the endgame, as the casino provides any player with an essentially endless supply of money. Even without casino money, you're likely to find more than enough of it later on through adventuring.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Appearance is easier to manipulate than Charisma. There are clean robes, diadems of beauty, cloaks of adornment, pendants of beauty - all rather common items that improve the Appearance stat considerably. On the other hand, Charisma can be improved only by the rather rare helm of leadership and the grantedly common necklace of the silver tongue. The Appearance stat wins that particular round. The items that improve Appearance are easier to recognize (cloaks of adornment always are the one kind of cloak that isn't hooded or leather but weighs 40 stones, clean robes are identified as such on sight and silver diadems are always diadems of beauty) and stacked together even surpass the bonus of the helm of leadership.&lt;br /&gt;My advice: In case of elven characters, take advantage of the high Appearance score by choosing female. Hurthlings, gnomes and drakelings should probably choose males, but at least for all the others shopping isn't that important a criterion. Be aware of the implications of choosing either gender already discussed, and remember that it's most important to adhere to the third criterion, which is, incidentally, also the master criterion for anything discussed in the whole section II:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Duh&lt;br /&gt;Play whatever you want to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;III. Playing style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Divine spellcaster trouble: Why play a Druid when you can play a Priest?&lt;br /&gt;It's a good question. These are the only primary divine spellcasters in the game (The Paladin casts divine spells, too, but is a primary melee fighter). Both of them share the tendency to find lots of books, with a lower probability of finding offensive spells. Druids and Priests alike are more likely going to be stuck with those eight copies of the spellbook of Know Alignment, one of the most pointless products of Ancardian literature known to man, just as an example. Anyway, if you look at Priests and Druids, you will notice the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Priests have (usually) better armor and melee weapons&lt;br /&gt;- Priests have nice stats&lt;br /&gt;- Priests get spell cost discounts as class powers that even outclass the Wizard's&lt;br /&gt;- Priests get Detect Item Status&lt;br /&gt;- Priests are a lot more literate&lt;br /&gt;- Did I mention those badass spell cost discounts? Look at them, they're frikkin' huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the Druid have to offer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Sucky class powers (The ability to evade wilderness encounters is probably the best of the lot - that's saying much)&lt;br /&gt;- Average armor and melee weapons&lt;br /&gt;- Average stats (No penalties, remarkably)&lt;br /&gt;- No spell cost discounts whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;- Animals won't attack you (oooh, big deal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why play a Druid instead of a Priest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "Animals won't attack you" is actually a bigger deal than you might think. Animals are one of the most prominent, and more dangerous types of monsters in the early game - most of the poisonous foes early on are animals. Druids will usually have more neutral monsters in a given level than any other class. Neutral monsters are useful. You can bypass them with the ":s" command, but hostile monsters will mostly bump against these like a wall, meaning you can use neutral monsters as buffers to help you escape. Sure, you won't get XP for the animals you don't kill, but what do you want XP for? The craptastic class powers or that tiny bit of extra HP and PP you get? You're not in a hurry to increase in level!&lt;br /&gt;- Some priests have lower than average equipment. Yay for being average all across the board!&lt;br /&gt;- You can piss off your deity without losing your glorious class powers. Okay, they're not worth having in the first place, but even so.&lt;br /&gt;- You are guaranteed an offensive spell in the beginning of the game. Priests oftentimes start out with only defensive spells.&lt;br /&gt;- Actually, that's pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I can't coat it into more sugar than I already did. Priests are better than Druids. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, that doesn't mean playing a Druid can't be fun. They are primary spellcasters, after all. Even though they are divine spellcasters and thus not as good at casting exclusively arcane spells (like ball spells), they still get just as mighty in the endgame once enough spells and suitable mana and willpower are acquired. So what if you have to pay the full power point cost for your spells? You'll still kick ass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Druids are also useful as therapy after you've encountered far too many cats for your taste in the last few games. Those damn cats you must not kill in order to receive that enormously powerful artifact! A Druid has considerably fewer problems. With very few exceptions, all cats are created neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Playing Druids&lt;br /&gt;Druids are spellcasters. This means you'll find a lot of books, and you'll have to put some thought into using them. Books should either be read until they disappear, read some times and then kept, or sold. The best of these procedures, in my opinion, is the first. Reading books trains your Learning stat, which helps you reading more powerful books you may find later or already possess. So even if you have more castings of Know Alignment than you'll ever need (read: any at all), read those five books you've just found! If you get a point of Learning out of it, it was definitely worth it. Keeping a book serves two purposes: Waiting until your Learning, Literacy and Concentration is higher so you get more learnt castings out of it, or bookcasting. A primary spellcaster should have no need for bookcasting, usually. Early on, some especially complex spells may refuse to provide you with decent castings, granting 20 castings per read or so (by "castings", I refer to the number that appears first in every spell's description, which will go down by a random, usually single-digit number every time you cast that particular spell - it's not the number of castings left, because that number is indeterminable). If this is the case, you should keep the book until you get better at Learning and Literacy, and if you have a desperate need for that spell, bookcast it. Selling books may be useful, too, in case you really need the money, but reading them instead is usually worthwhile at least for the training of Learning.&lt;br /&gt;From books we switch the focus to spells. There are several types of spells that damage the enemy: Bolt spells, ball spells and "touch" spells. Bolt spells have the farthest reach of all the spells, but they can only be cast in a single line. Luckily, foes have the habit of lining up in a hallway, which makes casting the bolt spell a very fun thing to do indeed. Some bolt spells have the property that they bounce off walls, meaning that very skilled users of these spells can bounce them around corners to hit even more foes there. Very nifty, but also dangerous, since these spells bounce straight back if you accidentally shoot them at a wall or corner (The longer your spell range, the more dangerous it gets, especially if there is a wall behind you as well!). Many a promising spellcaster died casting a bouncing spell the wrong way. Divine Wrath, your starting spell and a very important tool for early game survival as a Druid, is such a bouncing spell.&lt;br /&gt;Ball spells create a blast originating from the square you're standing on, hitting all surrounding enemies. This blast is greater if you meet or exceed certain levels of willpower, and the blast ignores walls or doors, meaning that enemies standing behind walls or doors, but inside the blast radius, will still get hit. Very sneaky; in fact I now instruct you to laugh maniacally every time you pull this off. These spells are the most damaging of all, and also the most expensive in mana cost.&lt;br /&gt;Touch spells are few and far between - except for Baptism of Fire, or Burning Hands as arcane spellcasters would call it, there are only a few. These spells affect only one square next to you, and are good for cases where there is only one monster you want to kill.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, as a spellcaster, you have many ways of making your life easier, once you've accumulated the proper repertoire. A key spell is Ethereal Bridge (or Teleportation). Not only allows it for quick escaping in a pinch, it can also shorten travel times by a large margin. However, you need teleport control to maximize the usefulness of this spell. Teleport control can be gained from the corpse of a blink dog. Should you ever stumble across a blink dog and it summons its blink dog cronies, hope for the best! Though you will have to attack the blink dog for it to summon its cronies. Or tame it with the help of bones, so it attacks other monsters and summons its cronies against them. Whatever way you choose, make it so that lots of blink dogs die so you get one of their corpses! Protector of nature my ass!&lt;br /&gt;Another make-your-life-easy spell is Knowledge of the Ancients (Magic Map), which provides you with partial knowledge of the dungeon map. This is good to find places in dungeon parts you haven't explored before but can't seem to find any way leading to, or locations to teleport to. Especially in the Minotaur Maze this spell is the key to success over failure.&lt;br /&gt;It also should be mentioned that as a divine spellcaster, your healing spells will improve a lot more by use than those of arcane spellcasters, meaning you can rely on them a lot more to survive tough situations. The longer you live, the longer you can bash your opponent with your weapon!&lt;br /&gt;There's a whole load of other spells of varying usefulness, the last advice I will give here is: Be creative! Especially early on, when you may have to make do with what you get, you may find spells useful you wouldn't even think about using otherwise. Maybe there is a spell suitable or even designed to solve your current predicament?&lt;br /&gt;Being a Druid, spellcasting doesn't come easy to you, as you start with low Literacy and Concentration scores, meaning you don't get many castings out of spellbooks. Thus, you will spend some time fighting melee. The first thing you should do once you start up the game is hit "i" end equip your wooden shield. If your character starts out with a two-handed weapon of some sort, the first thing you should do is find a one-handed weapon and equip that and your wooden shield (you can delay this until you stop finding only daggers, but if you find a broadsword or especially a spear, switch). Shields are important for spellcasters, because they help you defend. Your main way of attacking in the hard battles is using spells, which don't use your to-hit and damage formulas, meaning you can do everything you can to maximize DV. This means switching to coward before casting a spell while an enemy is near, and wearing the best shield you can get your hands on. You can fight in melee, too, of course - but you're not that good at it without a decent melee weapon, and seeing that you don't have class powers, skills or exceptional stats to back up your measly melee prowess, you shouldn't risk going all-out - you'll be hit more than it's worth. Of course, this is different for trolls or orcs in the beginning, but once you've developed your magic skills, you'll want to benefit from a high shield skill.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after you've started battling evil monsters with a bit of knowledge in the Divine Wrath spell and your combination of low-end melee weapon and wooden shield, the game is a game of "kill killable monsters" and "run away from unkillable monsters" and "avoid to die in the process". Be not afraid to run away and use your spells in doing it. Likewise, remember that you have spells! It's a good strategy to try and take out all the monsters early on with your melee weapon and resort to a Divine Wrath once you notice you have encountered a particularly hard nut to crack.&lt;br /&gt;Later on, as you find more spellbooks and become more skilled at magic, your Druid will become a lot more easy and fun to play. More spells, more castings and more PP are the main reasons for that! Just remember that later on, the powerful monsters will have a lot more resistances and will not be easily affected by most spells. A rule of thumb: Minor Punishment (or Magic Missile, as the heathen dabblers in the spellcasting arts will call it) works against everything... Eventually.&lt;br /&gt;Druids love to have high DV and PV, and they love to be speedy because it enables them go get more ground in a battle, thus letting them cast more spells and regenerate more PPs to cast even more spells. Druids love the Learning, Willpower and Mana stats. Learning enables them to read books more effectively, granting more castings. Willpower increases the power of spells, and certain values of Willpower increase the radius of ball spells, making them even more effective at fighting huge crowds of monsters. Mana increases the number of PPs you can have, and thus the number of spells you can cast before you effectively run out of PP, especially when coupled with PP regeneration - which is another important attribute for Druids. PP regeneration can be increased with a better Concentration skill and potions of raw mana, as well as a certain talent. Strength, Toughness and Dexterity are still important, because they enable you to carry more stuff and deal more damage, take more punishment, and give you more DV and speed, in order. Perception is of minor importance as it only enables you to look farther and has a minor influence on the success of trap evasion. Appearance and Charisma are of very tangential influence. Appearance is nigh useless unless you're female (see II.3), charisma at least has an influence on success 'o'rdering pets around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Druid class powers&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the part of the guide where I will whine a lot, so be prepared. We will talk about Druid class powers. Druid class powers are a perfect example for one of the main features of ADOM: Imbalanced classes. Some classes are simply better than others, in some cases a lot. This is fully intentional, of course, as it provides players with opportunities to challenge themselves (and guide writers with opportunities to whine). After all, this isn't World of Warcraft, where players think they have reason to whine on message boards because their favorite character has one skill that is slightly less powerful than a similar skill of another class, or because there is one item available for anyone that makes their entire build slightly less insanely powerful than other builds and therefore completely obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, let's go through those class powers step by step, but first discuss the class feature which is not a class power as such: The fact that animals won't attack you. This is a boon and a curse. A boon it is because peaceful animals can be quite helpful early on. You can use them to block the way for a pursuing monster by bypassing them in a hallway using the ":s" command. Sometimes, they fight other monsters hostile to you and help you take them out. You also don't have to worry about killing cats anymore (Killing a cat denies you access to a very powerful artifact), as you will be warned before you attack them, and they won't attack you, leading to peaceful coexistence. A curse (or annoyance) it is mainly because of breeders. Non-hostile breeders will quickly swarm whole parts of dungeon levels with more non-hostile breeders, leading to wailing, gnashing of teeth, and ":s"-clickfests. The other annoyance (A minor one) is that all those neutral animals created mean less XP for you, since you cannot kill them without taking alignment damage or exploiting a bug. You make up for that by killing the other monsters, though, and you're not in a hurry to gain levels. You'll see why after I've finished whining. One point of caution: Not all animals are non-hostile. Animals summoned by enemies such as black wizards, wererats or werewolves will be hostile. Keethrax' animals are likewise hostile, including his goddamned cats. A good reason not to pick that particular quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At level 6, Druids gain the ability to automatically evade wilderness encounters. This is actually not bad. In fact, it's the best class power the Druid will get, at least in my opinion. This ability means that you won't be killed by overly powerful wilderness encounters in the early game, for instance, on the way to the Caverns of Chaos, or even in the small eastern part of the wilderness where the early game dungeons are located. No swamp hydra deaths, no hill orc raiding party rapes... Of course, this class power leaves a bitter aftertaste as it effectively obsoletes the main use of one of your skills - Survival. It would have helped to evade wilderness encounters; now it only enables you to get food in the wilderness. Which you won't need to do if you're any smart and buy lots of large rations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 12 grants you... The awesome power to regenerate power points twice as fast in the wilderness. Now, what do you need this for, after you got a class power six levels before that enabled you to avoid all wilderness encounters, cutting down the fighting you need to do in the wilderness to pretty much zero? The only use I could imagine is that you will be able to leave a dungeon and regenerate power points quicker before getting inside again. Only that even without this class power, this would still work fast enough. And if you were able to leave a dungeon specifically to do this, you're probably not far deep down, meaning you probably aren't level 12 in the first place, or you would be severely underpowered for your level. If there was more need for fighting to be done while in the wilderness (I have to check whether the quicker regeneration still works while you're engaged in battle in locations such as the dwarven graveyard or any wilderness level itself), this would be nice, but as approximately 95 percent of the game, and 99.9 percent of the fighting, will take place in some sort of dungeon... Bah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 18 grants you an immunity to weather effects. This means that... Well... If it rains, your equipment and inventory won't get all drenched, soaked or rusty. You could wear a hooded cloak and carry a waterproof blanket to replicate this effect; both are items you are bound to find a lot until level 18. You're going to have, like, several spare hooded cloaks since cloaks get destroyed frequently and it's good to carry around a lot of them, and you're going to have about as many waterproof blankets. Also, only about 5 percent of your game will (should) take part in the wilderness, and heavy rain is rare. This class power is pathetically weak, especially for a level 18 class power. It's up there in the uselessness Hall of Shame together with the level 25 class power of the farmer, the ability to make mighty iron rations out of corpses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next class power up for evaluation, level 25, is the ability to summon animals at the cost of Mana stat points. You're level 25. At this point in the game, the animals you will be able to summon wouldn't even be able to scratch you were they fighting you. Likewise, against opponents you would need support against, they would fall like there is some sort of prize for falling most quickly. Also, they would win that prize. The only real use of these extra animals is to create them as cannon fodder or moving obstacles. For instance, you fight the Ancient Chaos Wyrm and don't like to be hit by his shock attack, so you summon an animal to let it stand between you and the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. Now the Wyrm won't be able to hit you until he has dispatched your furry friend! Apart from not seeming like the kind of thing a Druid who takes roleplaying seriously would do, it doesn't work too well as a strategy, as you still have to kill the thing the animals shields you from, and if this requires a bolt spell it will kill the animal as well. It's not the most useless class power ever, I suppose, but considering you have to sacrifice Mana stat points to fuel it and you can summon friends to help you using other means (most notably a scroll of familiar summoning) that do not require that sacrifice, not really anything to yearn for, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 32 gets you the likewise useless twin brother of the level 12 class power: It enables you to regenerate HP twice as fast in the wilderness. Right. Imagine a level 31 Druid, by that point probably equipped with several variants of healing spells, a Healing skill at level 100, maybe even an item of regeneration or two, and with lots of potions of extra and ultra healing or lots of blessed spenseweed herbs, fights a heated battle deep in the main dungeon, a dozen of levels away from the nearest exit into the wilderness. What will that Druid think once he has acquired the next level and therefore this class power? I'd wager it'd be something along the lines of "The FUCK?" or "Dammit" or "I really should've listened to my job counselor when she told me that Druid wasn't really a promising career option". Or he'd simply shrug and go on with his business. Which you should do, too. Another class power to forget about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the second best of the class powers will become available at level 40: The immunity to shock. It does sound pretty awesome the first time you read it. My major problem with this: It comes much too late to be of use. A level 40 Druid is usually in the process of wrapping up a game, and at this point, he should have either acquired shock immunity in some other way (by eating a blessed lightning lizard corpse, getting crowned with it or possessing corresponding items, like a crown of lightning or the artifact armor Nature's Companion) or sufficient resistance (double should be enough, triple is very easy to achieve: intrinsic from any blue dragon corpse, elemental gauntlets and Ring of the High Kings is a nice combination) thanks to artifacts or rings to survive anything made of lightning opponents may throw at him. Should a level 40 Druid not have any source of shock immunity, this is a nice class power, but not likely to improve a lot on the success you've already been having if you made it this far. Might be nice for the Blue Dragon Caves, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, at level 50, another one of those powers that would've been awesome had they come earlier. Less corruption from corrupting attacks, employed by balors for instance, might help you a bit on D:50, where you're likely to be at this point. 10 percent, however, is pretty low. It essentially means that on average, for every ten corrupting hits, you can absorb one for free getting the same corruption a normal character would get. It might save your ass should you have come to D:50 ill-prepared, though, so it's far from a useless class power. In general, I consider the level 50 class power to be always a pretty unimportant one, regardless of its power, simply because if you've reached level 50 without it, it's fair to assume you don't need it for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say this at the end of this part of the guide: Druids are tailored to be better in the wilderness than in a dungeon. If you decide to play your game in a way that is wilderness-heavy, like a challenge game that requires you to only play in the wilderness until you reach character level 50, Druids are a lot more useful than they are in a standard "close the game and win" game. This guide assumes you want to do the latter; that's why I heap so much abuse and laughter on the Druid class powers. They're not all that bad, only specialized in a way that makes them almost useless for normal needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, a nice effect of the Druid class powers being so useless is that you don't need to concentrate all that much on gaining levels. It's still good to be higher level for the skill advances, extra PP and HP and such, but it's not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are you still here? Don't you want to read the next section? What, you want to hear about the bug? The bug that allows you to attack neutral monsters without alignment damage? But why? Surely you can play this game the way it was intended, without exploiting minor errors made by The Creator that allow you to do things you shouldn't be able to do? Sigh. Fine. If you attack a neutral monster by hitting "y" in the dialog "Do you really want to attack whoever?", you get an alignment hit. This holds true if you shoot spells, missiles or thrown weapons AT them (In case of the spell, you aren't even asked, but still get the drop). What you can do, however, is aim your missile or throwing weapon anywhere you want. Not only is this a useful trick if you want your missile to fly a slightly different course so that it can hit an enemy when direct aiming at him would hit an obstacle, it also means that if you aim at nowhere on particular (an empty square), and were to hit a neutral monster purely by accident (yeah, right), that monster would turn hostile, but your alignment wouldn't go towards chaotic. Because you obviously wouldn't have intended (ha ha) to hit the monster, therefore it wouldn't have been right to give you a penalty on your alignment! Congratulations, you just tricked the moral code of a computer program! I'm so proud of you! (I mean, would have tricked, because such low methods are obviously beneath your ADOM playing standards, are they not? Right? Yeah, right.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Battle tactics&lt;br /&gt;Your tactics stance (the thing you can set with the keys from F1 to F7) should be on Coward every time you cast a spell in battle. If it is not, at least in hard fights (no one cares about your tactics stance if you off a goblin with Greater Divine Touch just for kicks), you're not doing yourself a favor. Remember: You can change your tactics stance at any time without it costing you anything. You can freely change between Coward and Berserk for every turn of a battle if you so desire, regardless of how unrealistic this may be: "HARRRR I SMASH YOU *click* oh no, don't hurt me, please, have mercy *click* GRRRR I WILL FEED YOU YOUR GENITALS *click* aaaah mummy help me". The Tactics skill should be high priority because it increases the DV you gain if you switch to Coward. If you are not casting spells, choosing the right tactic isn't as straightforward; generally, the more PV the opponent has, the more damage you should aim to deal, and against opponents with special attacks you don't want to be hit by (like strength or toughness drain), too offensive tactics aren't wise. One thing you should remember: If you have the Tactics skill on a reasonable level, 60 or something, then don't fight with normal tactics. Fight either in aggressive or defensive mode. Why? Because you sacrifice a minor amount of DV or to-hit/damage to get a great amount of the other in both cases. Defensive mode is usually my favorite for battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. L33t Dr00d 5k111z&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Climbing&lt;br /&gt;You climb mountains or out of pits with this. For pits, the skill score affects your success climbing out; for mountains, it lowers the time you spend climbing. The game can be finished without even climbing once in the mountains, and to visit all locations available in the game it's theoretically necessary to climb exactly six mountain squares, four of which you have to climb solely to reach the Sinister Library of Niltrias and go back again. Of course, you will climb more mountain squares if you don't visit the dungeons in the upper left corner of the Drakalor Chain in one go, but still, there is no need to fool around in the mountains. In other words, climbing these squares faster with the help of a higher Climbing skill is in no way important. Having a higher chance to climb out of pits helps in a situation where you are currently in a pit with a dangerous monster closing in on you; however, these situations are very, very rare. Climbing must be at 100 if you want to enter the Rift, though, so if you plan to enter it at some point, you have to pay attention to this skill, as it will probably not reach 100 if you don't invest some skill advances or training from Yergius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Concentration&lt;br /&gt;Increases PP regeneration and has a positive influence on learning from books. You are a spellcaster. This is your unrivaled favorite numero uno Überskill. You want it at 100 as soon as feasible. It needs some training to get there, though. You train this skill by depleting your PP supply so you have to regenerate it. In other words, you train this skill by doing what you're going to do all the time anyway - cast spells! If that isn't handy, nothing is. If you don't cast spells, you obviously don't need this skill, but it's a great help once you get your spellcasting started. A high level in this spell achieved by training isn't worth wasting your precious early Divine Wraths on, though - use Divine Wrath when it is needed to save your life. If your human druid started with a useless extra spell, use it more often early on so you can at least train up Concentration with it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) First Aid&lt;br /&gt;Can be 'a'pplied to heal recently sustained damage, and has a small chance of fighting (or healing) poison or sickness. A useful, and often underused, skill. You have the Healing skill, meaning HP regeneration isn't that much of an issue, but still - don't deny yourself the advantage of using this skill. Of course, if you're engaged in battle against a powerful monster beating the crap out of you, you won't have time for First Aid. After the battle is over, however, you will, and those few HP you may still be able to regain are nothing to scoff at, at least in the early game. Because the amount of damage healed by First Aid is a percentage of the amount of damage recently sustained, this skill will heal more damage if your enemy hit you harder - meaning that even late in the game, when a fire elemental has dealt a critical blow for, say, 100 damage (they do that occasionally), using First Aid will benefit you by a quite large margin. Still, as long as the monster who deals even larger margins of damage is near, it's probably wiser to use the more powerful means of Healing available to you later on in the form of blessed potions of extra and ultra healing. Every character has First Aid, but at the levels you start out usually (Druids have a higher level compared to most other classes, granted), it's unreliable. The more points you invest in it, the more likely it is to help. And in the early period of the game when you lack the Slow Poison and Neutralize Poison spells (humans *may* start out with one of those), alraunia antidotes, potions of cure poison (It's *possible* for every Druid to start out with one or even two) and most importantly poison resistance, this is potentially the last thing that can save you from death to poisoning. Being poisoned, you may have to wait out the poisoning period, and without using First Aid to replenish most of the HP lost to poison, you will most probably run out of HP faster than your Healing skill and your natural regeneration will be able to compensate for. There also is, as mentioned, a minor chance to fight sickness; sickness is a lot rarer than poison, but can be contracted by any rat that attacks you and is usually eventually fatal for an early game PC. Again, you can use First Aid everytime you lose HP due to sickness. The chance to get rid of it entirely is pretty low, though. At the very least, First Aid will keep you alive a few more steps until you can see a professional Healer. Since you have Healing, First Aid isn't of as high importance as I may have made it out to be, and it certainly will become obsolete once Healing spells or herbs are obtained. Nevertheless, it probably isn't a waste to spend some of your early skill advances on it, when you will need them most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Gardening&lt;br /&gt;Can be 'a'pplied to plant seeds. Plant seeds may turn into a tree (or so it is rumored), though I don't seem to have much success with that usually - which doesn't matter, as there are trees aplenty in the wilderness, even if you happen to have need for them. Herb seeds you plant on dungeon levels successfully will turn into herbs. Remember that a single bush of herbs will die out very quickly. For your herbs to survive, you have to make sure at least three herbs are planted in an L-shaped group. You can produce herbs by pouring holy water on the ground; however, unless the level in question has or has had herbs at some point which were either there initially or planted with the help of Gardening, these will not be able to sustain themselves regardless of how many neighbouring herbs they have. Herb seeds are very, very rare. This means that just with herb seeds and Gardening, you won't be able to get into some serious herb farming; you need a good base of herbs for that, as it will be found in so-called herb levels (One of these is guaranteed), or lots and lots of holy water. If you want to create a herb patch in a dungeon level of your choice that didn't have herbs originally, use a herb seed to make the whole level herb-fertile, and holy water to make the wondrous L-shape. Low levels of Gardening lead to low levels of success, and since herb seeds are so rare you don't want that. If you plan to use Gardening at all, which you certainly won't exactly need to, make sure it is on a high level. It can probably be trained by planting some of the otherwise highly useless plant seeds. Be careful, however: 'A'pplying Gardening means your PC will try to plant a herb seed if one is available in the pack. If you want to plant plant seeds in stead, drop the herb seeds first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Haggling&lt;br /&gt;Can be 'a'pplied on a shopkeeper to haggle over shop prices. Has (according to my experience) a very low chance to actually work out in *your* favor (high Charisma probably helps), and small improvements on price are entirely not worth the investment of skill advances you'd need to get them. Money can be a problem early on, but it's more worthwhile to just kill more monsters to get more treasure, equipment and XP in addition to the cash. Pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Healing&lt;br /&gt;Heals HP at random intervals. The higher the skill, the more HP will be healed over a given time period. A very valuable skill, especially until you find other, plentiful means of healing such as books containing healing spells or special kinds of herbs. A major early game helper, so even though this trains naturally (read: by you taking damage, which is near impossible to avoid) and will reach 100 at some point in the future, you may want to give it an extra boost to help your character survive early on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Herbalism&lt;br /&gt;Allows to pick herbs that aren't cursed. Gives a chance to identify herbs upon picking. The higher the skill, the more blessed and uncursed and the less cursed herbs will be found: at 100, the ratio is usually similar to 60% blessed, 25% uncursed, 15% cursed. Also higher is the probability that you will identify a given herb on picking: at 100, every herb picked is instantly identified. You will also be able to pick more herbs before the bush withers: about 3 from a fully blossomed bush without Herbalism, 10 with Herbalism at 100. You can also 'a'pply the skill to give you a higher chance to know which herbs grow in a particular bush, and what state the bush is in (whether it is full of blossoms or already nearly withered or anything in between). In short, this skill makes you a l33t herb expert. There are two herbs that heal your HP (pepper petal, spenseweed), there is a herb that heals poison (alraunia antidote) and one that heals sickness (curaria mancox), there are two herbs that can increase your stats (morgia roots and mosses of mareilon) and there is one herb that, at least in its blessed state, is the most filling food in the entire game (stomafillia). There are also herbs that damage your HP (burb root), poison you (demon daisy), sicken you (devil's rose) or completely empty your stomach (stomacemptia), and even those CAN be useful, if one is careful with them and knows what he or she is doing. Herbs provide one of the best ways to pimp your character. Be glad that you have this skill, invest in it and start farming herbs! Note that in their cycles of growth and withering, herbs follow the rules of Conway's game of Life. Check out wikipedia for those rules, or the guidebook if you want a more detailed guide to ADOM herb farming! Long live herbalism!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Listening&lt;br /&gt;Allows to hear things. The higher the skill, the fewer sounds will elude you. For example, if you hear a thunderous explosion, some monster somewhere on the dungeon stepped on a fireball trap - useful information? Well... This skill isn't among the most, or even particularly helpful. In any case, since it is trained all the time without your influence, it doesn't need any skill advances spent on it. It will reach 100 some time after level 15, and until that, the values you have are high enough. You'll be fine (and best off) not paying any attention to this skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Literacy&lt;br /&gt;Enables you to read scrolls, books and all other writings. Higher values increase the chance to successfully read a spellbook in order to learn the spell included, and have an influence on success reading grave messages or the scroll of literacy check. A Literacy value of 100 will enable you to read anything, anywhere, anytime, with one notable exception. Also, success reading spellbooks is dependant on other factors as well, like the Learning stat or character class (Mindcrafters, Beastfighters or Barbarians for instance are pretty bad at it, but Druids are primary spellcasters and thus very good). This skill is of crucial importance to a spellcaster. Druids start in the forties; this needs heavy improvement. Without a decent skill, you will fail reading spellbooks often, and failing to read spellbooks can have harsh consequences, including and not restricted to the loss of the spellbook. Get this to 100 as soon as possible. It will require some training. That's where spellbooks of Shitty Spell No One Cares About come in handy, or one of the scrolls that can be read repeatedly without it disappearing - the ratling pamphlet the ratling rebel at the arena hands out is the most useful of these, as it doesn't trigger a message that you have to press a key several times to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Survival&lt;br /&gt;Can be 'a'pplied to search for food in the wilderness. Improves battle conditions against wilderness encounters: You will be ambushed less often, and you will be able to spring an ambush yourself more often. Also, it is easier to evade encounters altogether. This skill is of restricted use, and once you've reached level 6 you're able to evade all wilderness encounters without fail, obsoleting a large part of that already restricted use. The ability to find food in the wilderness is pretty pointless, as there are other ways to get food that don't waste as much game time, and Survival only can save you from starvation if you are in the wilderness - did I already mention that about 95% of the game takes part very far away from the wilderness? Do not invest in this skill unless you plan to fool around in the wilderness a lot, for example as part of a Wilderness Level 50 challenge game, where you admittedly will need it for the food, lacking other sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Swimming&lt;br /&gt;Lessens or prevents damage from drowning while swimming in water. Improves your speed while moving underwater. The higher the skill, the greater the chance that you will "easily swim the water" instead of drown. Weight is also a factor in that, though. Not a bad skill, in unforeseen situations it may save your life. The probability that you have to cross a river at some point is high, and depending on your luck finding spells (Nether Bolt can be used to cross rivers, too) you may not have other means at your disposal (except Bridge Building, but Swimming is infinitely preferablte to wasting time for that). Since this skill may save you from death in an emergency situation, spending skill advances on it can hardly be called a waste, though it is by no means essential, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Woodcraft&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the time spent on chopping trees. This skill sucks monkey balls. Because you don't have Fletchery, you can use logs only for bridges. Because you have Swimming, you can cross rivers without bridges. Because you are a spellcaster, you are extremely unlikely to need a wooden bridge at any point in the game - ice bridges are easily available to you. And remember that this skill only helps CHOPPING trees - on the off chance that you ever need to build wooden bridges, you will be better served improving your ability to build said bridges so you don't have to chop as many trees - which saves a lot more time than improving Woodcraft ever will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Skills obtainable through race choice&lt;br /&gt;Note: All skills can be obtained by scrolls or potions of education. However, these grant random skills and sometimes only skill increases to existing skills, meaning they are nowhere near reliable if your goal is a certain skill. All skills with two exceptions (Alertness and Healing) can be gotten by wishing for them - 100% reliable, but wishes are very valuable and rare. Still, some skills *are* worth a wish. Some skills cannot be obtained in a way other than these two, but there is a certain number of race-specific skills that can be obtained in the game by fulfilling various requirements of equally varying difficulty. It's important to know, if you evaluate a skill for race choice, whether and how soon and easily you can obtain this skill otherwise. If there is no specific way to get the skill mentioned, it is only available through wishing and scroll/potion of education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Alertness&lt;br /&gt;Dark elves and drakelings have finely tuned reflexes. Passive skill that increases your chances to evade traps and spells. On high levels, DV points are added. Alertness prolongs your life especially against powerful enemy spellcasters throughout the entire game. It's somewhat hard to increase, though, probably because it is trained by successfully evading spells, and spellcasters are rather rare. If you have finished increasing the skills more critical to early game survival, increase this to the maximum amount possible. Note that this skill cannot be wished for - Wishing for "Alertness" yields an increase of the Perception stat. This skill is probably one of the best you can get by choosing a certain race. To top it off, both dark elves and drakelings get other nice skills as well, most notably Find Weakness and Stealth for the dark elf, Food Preservation and Music for the drakeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Archery&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings are extremely skilled at throwing rocks for some unfathomable reason. Not only start they with this skill as a result, they also get a weapon skill of 4 in thrown rocks and only need two thirds the marks to increase the thrown rocks and sling weapon skills. Archery increases your to-hit and damage with missile attacks, giving +5 to-hit and +2 to damage at level 100. Certain levels in this skill are a prerequisite for the Lightning Shot and Eagle Eye talents. This skill is kind of useful. It depends on how much you want to use missile weapons. Since you are a spellcaster, you have other means of killing enemies from a distance at your disposal. Nevertheless, ammo equipped with slaying powers is a lot more common than slaying power artifact melee weapons, and there are opponents in the game that are a major pain in the ass to subdue in melee or with spells, but easily dispatched with the right kind of slaying ammunition, especially if you're halfway competent at archery in general, i. e. you chose the right talents. The talents you need the Archery skill for are very powerful. Eagle Eye nets you boost to to-hit and damage equal to Good Shot and Keen Shot combined, and Lightning Shot builds on Quick Shot to make you some sort of bow and arrow machinegun! Druids benefit well from this skill, but being skilled in missile weapons isn't as important for them as it is for, say, a next-to-no-spellcasting melee class like Fighter or Barbarian. If your ADOM playing style is archery-heavy, a Hurthling is worth your consideration, though. They also offer Food Preservation, Cooking and Stealth, all not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Athletics&lt;br /&gt;Trolls have incredibly muscular builds. This passive skill increases speed, giving a maximum boost of 8 points of speed at skill level 100. It also increases the chance of getting increases in the physical attributes Strength, Dexterity, Toughness and Appearance. This is quite an awesome skill, especially if maxed. Trolls also get Food Preservation, Gemology and Mining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Backstabbing&lt;br /&gt;Orcs are as dirty as their fighting tactics! Gives you the opportunity to "backstab" unsuspecting opponents, dealing additional damage. Backstab damage is not always dealt. For neutral opponents, the message "Do you really want to backstab the -foo-?" has to be generated if you want to get backstab damage. For hostile opponents which simply haven't yet seen you thanks to Darkness, the Stealth skill or invisibility, there is no such message, and whether you get backstab damage is a matter of skill level-influenced luck. Backstabbing can be obtained later on in the game, so it's not worthwhile to play an orc for it, since they don't get Stealth and need Invisibility or Darkness spells to get any use out of it.  Orcs do get Find Weakness and Mining as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Bridge Building&lt;br /&gt;Trolls are renowned for being crafty engineers... Actually, no, they aren't, but they still start with this skill - a mystery of the ages. You can build bridges with it. The higher the level, the higher is the chance to succeed when building a bridge segment by 'u'sing a hatchet on a log. This skill is almost absolutely useless. You start with the Swimming skill, so don't be a wuss and jump in. With a decent swimming skill and full health, every river can be crossed. If you don't have the time to regenerate yourself to full health or didn't think to get a decent swimming skill, you're screwed, and knowing how to build a bridge doesn't help you shit when there's a monster right behind you! When Swimming is otherwise out of the question, either because the body of water is too wide for you to swim through even at full health or because it's full of predator fish, you're going to have to use other means of crossing the river. And even if teleporting won't work because of the dungeon level preventing it, there is still one method left which is superior to Bridge Building: Ice bridges. You can make them with wands of cold or the Nether Bolt and Freezing Fury spells. Ice bridges can break if you carry more than 2000 stones of weight, but they don't require logs to be built, and the spells that produce them produce with every casting - Bridge Building has a high chance of failure on low level, and you don't get to a high level without wasting way too many skill advances on it and, God may have mercy on your soul, awful shitloads of practice. 2000 stones aren't enough for you? What kind of lazy idiot are you? Take several trips! Even if you wanted this skill - God knows why - it's pointless to play a troll for it. Trolls get the skill at a single digit value. To increase it, you need a manual of bridge building. You have to choose Rynt's quest to get it from Yrrigs. And guess what - ANY character who gets the manual can read it and get Bridge Building themselves. If you choose the Keethrax quest, trollish Druids will be the only ones with Bridge Building - completely and utterly stuck at a level at which you have to calculate fifteen logs per bridge segment, unless you wish for a manual of bridge building - a move so addlebrainedly idiotic you should delete ADOM in an instant if you actually find yourself even contemplating it. Choose trolls for Athletics, Food Preservation, Gemology, and Mining, if you do - all good reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Cooking&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings love to devour their slain foes' corpses well done and deliciously seasoned. This skill can be 'a'pplied on a corpse to try and cook it with the help of a cooking set. If successful, the corpse is cooked, if not, it is wasted. Higher levels mean lower chance of failure. Cooking corpses increases their nutrition value by 50 percent and slows down their decomposition rate considerably. This skill is helpful to keep corpses around that you can't or don't want to eat right now, but want to save for later. Here is a list of uses for it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cook every corpse in the early game before eating to get more nutrition out of it&lt;br /&gt;- Cook the corpses of highly powerful chaos beings (black druids, orb guardians, black unicorns) to be able to deliver them to Guth'Alak in time, who rewards you with a potion of cure corruption for them&lt;br /&gt;- Cook corpses that grant rare intrinsics that you can't eat right now due to being bloated&lt;br /&gt;- Cook corpses that grant rare intrinsics that you already have, to keep them healthy (well, healthy for you) until you can sell them to Munxip or any shopkeeper who runs a "general store", from whom you can buy them back any time in case you lose the intrinsic they give&lt;br /&gt;- Cook displacer beast corpses to provide a means of emergency teleportation&lt;br /&gt;- Cook karmic lizard or karmic dragon corpses to carry around in case you need them to remove dooming or cursing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This skill belongs in the "convenient, but of low importance" category. Hurthlings get Archery, Food Preservation and Stealth, too, so consider it a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Detect Traps&lt;br /&gt;Dwarves are l33t experts when it comes to sensing discrepancies in the dungeon around them. With this skill, they can find traps if they 's'earch for them. Without this skill, a character can find hidden doors with the 's'earch command, but never traps - he just doesn't know what to look for. A higher skill level increases the probability to find a trap in a search attempt, meaning you'll find traps quicker. A skill level of 100 doesn't guarantee the finding of a trap in a single attempt, but practically does so if you spend several turns searching. Detect Traps works with a ring of searching, enabling you to find traps without actively searching for them, but a high skill level is needed before this is of any help, and not every trap will be found without spending several turns searching. Traps hurt throughout the game: Early on, you live in fear of any kind of trap, especially the stone block one, because they can kill your Druid. Later on, you live in fear of traps because they can destroy your valuable magic items. Of course, nobody expects you to use Detect traps on every single dungeon square, but it's common sense to use it in heavily trapped areas such as the Pyramid or the Dwarven tomb or the air and mana temple. Also, you should check every door before trying to open it, because a door trap can - it's unlikely, but it can - trigger upon a failed attempt to merely open the door. Very nasty. This is a very useful skill, some feel it is essential; that depends on how well you can cope with the occasionally lost items and the damage. There is a wand of trap detection, so the effect of this skill isn't unique, and if you know the trap layout of the more dangerous places, you can use these and forget about Detect traps rather comfortably. Still, get it if you can. Detect Traps can be taught by Yergius if you gain entry into the Thieves Guild, so it's only worthwhile to choose a dwarf if you want Detect Traps right from the start, which may be a tad bit paranoid, but not a bad decision otherwise. Even if you're a dwarf, you want to gain entry into the Thieves Guild anyway to get the Stealth skill as well as skill training in Climbing and Stealth. Dwarves also get Mining and Smithing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Dodge&lt;br /&gt;High and gray elves are &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;gay&lt;/span&gt; elegant and graceful. Dodge adds DV. At skill level 100, 10 points of DV are gained. Nice skill, though the bonus isn't that overwhelming; especially considering you'll probably have serious trouble to get Dodge that high. Take every opportunity to increase it as long as it is possible. A nice addition to the gray and high elven skillset nevertheless, which otherwise isn't remarkable except for Stealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Find Weakness&lt;br /&gt;Dark elves and orcs know where it hurts the most! This skill increases the probability that a critical hit is scored. Critical hits cause double damage, but do not ignore PV. Still, since PV is substracted from your damage roll result, if your damage is doubled, you will gain more than only double the damage if your opponent's PV is higher than zero: If your opponent's PV is 20, and you deal 40 damage, only 20 get through; but if you deal a critical hit, 60 of the 80 resulting damage will be substracted from your opponent's HP, triple the amount you would have normally managed! Critical hits are awesome. Thus, Find Weakness is equally awesome. It doesn't affect spell damage, though, and you can probably live well without it, especially if you find artifacts with badass slaying powers. Still, playing a dark elf or an orc for this skill is a good decision. Dark elves offer Alertness and Stealth, orcs mainly offer Mining (you can ignore Metallurgy and Backstabbing pretty much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;Humans, trolls, hurthlings and drakelings... actually, I don't have any clue why they know how to preserve food, but the others don't. Perhaps they just love good food this much? Possession of this skill slows the rate at which food rots, and increases the likelihood of monsters leaving behind usable corpses. (Apparently, knowing how to not let food rot makes it more likely for you to carefully kill your enemy so the body isn't transformed to dust or whatever the hell happens with the body if you can't pick it up... This skill is pretty mysterious.) The higher the skill, the slower the rotting and the more corpses you get. All in all, a very useful skill. In the early game, it alleviates food problems somewhat by giving you more corpses. Throughout the game, it increases your chance at getting very nice corpses, such as the ones of quicklings, blink dogs or giant slugs, or ogres and giants... in short, 100 points in Food Preservation = maximum amount of stat-gaining corpses and rare instrinsics! It's not crucial to success, but helpful. Humans have only this skill going for them, while trolls, hurthlings and drakelings gain other skills too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Gemology&lt;br /&gt;Trolls and gnomes know what's what with shiny things. This skill allows for identification of gems. A skill level of 100 identifies almost any gem on the spot. Also it makes it possible for gems to appear amongst the rubble that is created when walls are dug either with a pickaxe or by a creature that possesses that ability, such as giant raccoons, ankhegs, giant ant workers and warriors or dwarves. This is also the prime appeal of this skill, especially for a spellcaster, because it means you can mine for crystals of knowledge, which increase the Learning score if blessed, to a max that is somewhere between the twenties and thirties. For Druids, who get a measly Learning bonus for being Druids, this is tremendously helpful. Of course, mining for gems requires a lot of pickaxes, or a lot of money to let Glod repair said pickaxes after breaking. It also has the inherent threat of waking powerful and pissed stone giants, meaning it's a very dangerous endeavour for an early game Druid and thus not as helpful as it could be - UNLESS YOU LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT. Druids are the master of gem mining simply because they can have others do it for them. Go to the second level of the Puppy Cave - the one that opens after you talk to the tiny girl - and watch the neutral ants dig up all the walls. Search through the rubble and rake in the jewelry! Whoever said that being a tree-hugging lover of nature doesn't pay? Gnomes and trolls not only offer this great skill - making good use of it is ESSENTIAL for trolls, because they get levels a lot slower and a higher Learning score at least offers more skill advances per level (apart from the desperately needed support in learning from books!). Both races get even more good skills! (Are you seeing why I have such a hard time deciding on a race? All of them except humans offer some unique benefit thanks to their skillset!) While not only both trolls and gnomes get Mining to assist their gemology, gnomes also get Ventriloquism and trolls get Food Preservation and Athletics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Metallurgy&lt;br /&gt;Orcs and dwarves know their metal. Grants a chance to identify pieces of ore and ingots on sight. Can be "a"pplied to determine whether a certain item is made of metal, and if it is, which kind. Higher levels improve success in identifying. Possible uses? Finding out which kind of ingot you have to use to improve certain items that don't automatically tell you which metal they're made of. Finding out which pieces of ore and ingots are of which metal so you can choose which to carry around with you. Except, you know, there is such a thing as trial and error for the items, and regarding ore and ingots, you'd be hard pressed to find any group of items that is easier to identify by weight than these. Iron is the heaviest item, mithril is a bit lighter, adamantium is a bit lighter than mithril, and eternium is yet another bit lighter than adamantium and about half the weight of iron (a little bit less, if you look at ingots and remember that they are pretty much the only examples of "pure" metal - Iron ingots weigh 20 stones, eternium ingots weigh 9 stones). Long story short, this skill sucks like a goddamned vacuum! Don't bother getting it! Play dwarves or orcs for their other merits: Find Weakness for the orc, and Detect traps and Mining for the dwarf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;m) Mining&lt;br /&gt;Trolls, orcs, gnomes and dwarves have uncanny knowledge of digging out tunnels and stuff. Decreases the time that passes while digging through stone using a pickaxe, and lessens the chance of a pickaxe breaking. At skill level 100, digging through a square takes only about five turns, and if the pickaxe is blessed, it should hold out for fifty diggings on average before you may have to fix it or get another one. This skill is convenient, but far from essential. There are means of digging besides using the Mining skill and a pickaxe which are far safer and quicker; most notably the fairly common wand of digging. Using a pickaxe for mining is what you must do if you want to mine for ore and gems, however. To mine for gems, you must have the Gemology skill. To mine for ore, no particular skill is needed, but with Mining both it and mining for gems will take a LOT less time. The third thing you can mine out of the dungeon walls is stone giants. If you're an early game PC, your reaction to a stone giant awoken and made hostile is going to be "OH MY GOD RUUUUUN", if you're reasonably powered up, it's going to be "Mhmmm tasty stone giant corpse extra strength point yum yum". A powerful gnomish or trollish Druid that has learned Smithing thus will be able to kill three birds with one stone if he decides to mine. This skill is convenient in general, and extra convenient if you're playing a gnome or a troll. Reasonable skill levels only add to its usefulness, and are a good thing to aim for once you find yourself with spare skill advances you don't really know what to use on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n) Music&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings got Rock'n Roll in their blood or something. This skill allows you to play musical instruments by 'u'sing them - at least with any chance of success. At level 100, you will always succeed playing the instrument. Levels inbetween directly govern your success. Playing music will tame nearby animal monsters - the same type of monsters that usually is already at least neutral to you. The emphasis is on "usually" - there are exceptions, and Music is good to remedy that. It's the cheapest method to get animal companions, once you've raised it to a decent skill level and found an instrument to use it with. Because of its low starting level and the fact that drakelings don't get any instrument, it is immediately disqualified as an early game helper - but the early game help it would have provided is mostly made up for by the Druid class feature. In conclusion, not the greatest skill out there, but useful. And since you can tame killer bugs, probably the most powerful animal out there bar none, even suitable for helping you in dangerous battles. Drakelings also get Food Preservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o) Pick Pockets&lt;br /&gt;Gnomes seem to be sneaky little greedy bastards. This skill allows you to pick pockets (duh). Higher skill levels improve success doing so. Unsuccessful picking of pockets is likely to turn the victim hostile. Use of this skill in general is a chaotic act unless you use it on a hostile opponent. Yeah, why would you use it on a hostile opponent? It's not like this skill magically generates an item in the pocket mere split-seconds before you pick it, leading to huge loads of additional items gained from a great number of enemies that possibly include artifacts or other hugely valuable items of weight 10 stones and lower. I mean, how crazy would that be? Don't be silly! Ha ha... Ha. Sigh. Can't fool you, can I? If you want to exploit the potential for cheap play that this skill offers, go right ahead. Note that you have to successfully pick the pockets of about twenty-five people to get access to the Thieves Guild. Also note that you can learn the Pick Pockets skill from Yergius right from the start without any requirement aside that of having to be non-lawful. It's thus highly unnecessary for you to be a gnome to get this skill, as ALL Druids start out neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p) Smithing&lt;br /&gt;Did you think that this would be an RPG where dwarves wouldn't adhere to their stereotypes? Allows to remove rust from weapons. Also allows to improve weapons, shields and armor that are made of any of the four metals. To use it, 'a'pply the skill while standing over a forge with a hammer in your hand and an anvil in your backpack. You can then choose an item to work on. If you choose a rusty item, you will attempt to remove the rust. If you choose any other item that is smithable (made of iron, mithril, adamantium or eternium), you will also be asked to choose an appropriate ingot to use in improving it. If you choose the ingot, you'll be able to do the same the other way around. If you choose a piece of ore, you will attempt to melt down the ore. For all of these actions, the Smithing level improves whether you will be successful and to what extent. This is especially important for improving items, as the higher the Smithing skill, the higher is the improvement you can achieve. Improving a weapon will increase to-hit and damage first, at the very last add a point of DV. Improving shields and armor will improve DV and PV. The skill is very powerful, which is alleviated by the difficulty you will have finding the tools to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Hammers are common - except for the two-handed huge iron hammers, you'll be able to use any kind of warhammer or large hammer.&lt;br /&gt;Anvils are rare. You can't rely on finding one, so it might be good to know that there are people who have anvils: Kherab, the dwarven artificer of Darkforge, and Glod, the dwarven smith in Dwarftown. Of course, if you try to kill Kherab, you'll notice he will prove to be a lot more vicious than you might be able to stomach. He is not invincible, but he has a hard-hitting poison melee attack. Kill him with humanoid slaying ammo, acid bolts or minor punishments. Glod is a pushover compared to him, but unfortunately attacking him outright will mean angering the whole Dwarftown - not good. But still, he is the best source of an anvil. The best way to get it is to either confuse him using the Ventriloquism skill - after which he will attack you and the whole of Dwarftown will rush to YOUR help thinking you were the one being attacked first - or to teleport him out of his smithy and try to lure him to another level. He will follow you if you go down or up stairs while he is in an adjacent square. Since he walks around randomly and you can't control where you teleport him, this is both a matter of luck and patience. Remember that you can switch places with him using ":s", and that this will push him slightly into the direction you want... But it remains a matter of luck and patience.&lt;br /&gt;The last thing you need is a forge. Forges can be randomly found in dungeons a good deal more commonly than anvils. However, since you will spend a lot of time whenever you smith, it's good to have a forge in a non-corrupting area. That might not always be possible - sometimes you are just that unlucky - but it's worth exploring every one of the non-corrupting dungeons in search of a forge. Both the Village Dungeon and the Druid Dungeon are non-corrupting all the way through, just like the Puppy Cave. The Unremarkable Dungeon is not only corruption-free, but has a higher chance to generate random dungeon features including forges - in nine cases out of ten, you'll find a forge there. Exploring the Unremarkable Dungeon, however, means getting through the Small Cave at least once. Either you do that early on in the game, where the place isn't as dangerous, or you do it later with invisibility and teleports. The Caverns of Chaos also offer seven or eight non-corrupting levels (Counting all the levels till D:9 including the shortcut level, but substracting the Big Room and the Arena) where a forge might be created. Most notably, if Dwarftown is on D:9, it will be non-corrupting, and so will be Glod's forge! If Glod is still on the Dwarftown level, he will charge you for using the forge, though. You have to lure him to another level (or kill him) to use his forge for free. If you already did that to get his anvil, less hassle for you.&lt;br /&gt;Before happily going off to kill poor Glod, remember that he is the only person in the game who will repair your broken items. Should he be dead, only scrolls of repair will be able to do that, and they're only available in restricted numbers. So before you kill him, mine all the ore you need, having him repair your pickaxes, THEN get his anvil. A good ADOM player knows well how to abuse and exploit the innocent while staying technically lawful...&lt;br /&gt;If you combine the holy trinity of anvil, hammer and forge, and add to that assloads of ore to make into ingots to improve items with, you have in your hands one of the best ways to really buff up your equipment. See that crown of regeneration [+0, +0]? Want to make it [+9, +9]? Thought so! Want your phase dagger to bypass your opponent's PV as usual AND have (+12, 1d4+9) [+1, 0]? Thought so! Have fun smithing!&lt;br /&gt;Note that the Smithing skill can be bought from Glod for a price. That price can be quite high, but is always affordable. Characters that obtain Smithing this way instead of by being a dwarf won't miss much, as the tools to use Smithing are hardly ever found before Dwarftown and Glod are reached. Dwarves also get Detect traps and Mining, though, the latter useful to mine the ore that is needed to get in some serious Smithing.&lt;br /&gt;(If you killed Glod for his anvil without having obtained Smithing beforehand, allow me to say this to you: BRUHAHAHAHAHAAAA! SERVES YOU RIGHT, YOU IDIOT!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;q) Stealth&lt;br /&gt;High, gray, dark elves and hurthlings are nimble and adept at moving silently or being simply too small to be seen. This skill will add a chance that a monster might not see you in the dim light of the dungeon. The higher the skill, the better the chance, but 100 will not make you invisible. Also, all Stealth bonuses are lost if you attack an opponent. The skill does not have an impressive effect - which is fine, because its job is to avoid making an impression. With the help of stealth, you might be able to position yourself better before you attack, or retreat without being noticed, or make backstabbing attacks with the help of the Backstabbing skill. This is actually one of the two main uses of Stealth: A chance to backstab without being invisible or making your surroundings dark. The other main use is simply possessing the Stealth skill at 100, because if you get it this high, you will be able to move quietly enough so that the Ghost Librarian in the Sinister Library of Niltrias will be grateful to you. If you move 2000 turns or something along those lines in his Library without 'C'hatting (spells can reportedly still be cast), he will even ask you to deliver something for him. The reward for this delivery is very valuable indeed, so going through all the hassle necessary - Increasing Climbing and Stealth to 100 - is very much worth it. Stealth can be taught by Yergius by gaining entry into his guild as described in the skill description of Pick Pockets, so it's not that crucial to play an elf or a Hurthling for it. Because it is one of the few skills that can assist you in early game survival, it might be beneficial to choose one of them anyway. High and gray elves also offer Dodge, dark elves also offer Alertness and Find Weakness, and hurthlings Archery, Cooking and Food Preservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;r) Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Gnomes have some strange abilities. What are they, circus people? Anyway, this skill can be 'a'pplied to try and confuse people or monsters. Confused people and monsters will stagger around for a while, come to their senses, and turn hostile to you if they weren't hostile before. This can be exploited to kill people "in self-defence" without getting any repercussions for it. Also, having monsters confused in battle makes them unable to use any action besides stumbling around and attacking you in melee. Very nice if you're confronted with monsters that have powerful spells. The weakness of Ventriloquism in this regard is that it has to be high level to be reliable, and that you have to stand adjacent to the target you use it on. Getting so close might prove hazardous to your health, especially if the skill check fails. If you want to use this skill, play a gnome, train it and spend skill advances on it to get it high (We're talking at least 80, preferably 100 here - training against small fry helps). Gnomes also have Gemology and Mining and so are a good choice in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;s) Acid Breath&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings have some serious case of bad breath. Special ability (used with "m") that spits a blob of acid in a certain direction. The blob has a range limited to a couple of squares. Once it hits an enemy, it deals damage to it. The amount of damage depends on the level of the drakeling. If the damage dealt is greater than the remaining HP of the enemy, the blob completely dissolves him and hits the next monster in range with the remaining damage. This isn't a skill per se, but like the skills mentioned in this section it's something you'll get if you play a certain race, and should be evaluated here as well. An important thing to know about the Acid Breath is that while it deals elemental acid damage and is unhindered by PV like a spell, it doesn't consume PP to use: Rather, it uses up nutrition. Food serves as fuel for the Acid Breath. This means that using it often means you'll need a lot more food. It also means that if you're bloated, you can use the Acid Breath to get yourself down to satiated again. This is handy in case you have a corpse in danger of rotting that you want to eat as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Also consider that the Acid Breath gains power solely by level; you can't train it by use or spend skill advances to make it any stronger, while spells and weapons can improve in spell effectivity or weapon skill. That's why you shouldn't use the Acid Breath except when it's necessary, you should rather train up melee and missile weapons or spells. Still, it's a major asset to have especially in the early game, when the Acid Breath provides a means to kill opponents with a "sort-of" spell even with zero PP. Spend all your money on large rations if you start the game as a drakeling Druid and want to use the Acid Breath.&lt;br /&gt;Note that being a racial ability, you can't get the Acid Breath from a wish or any kind of potion or scroll... Well, not directly. There is a corruption, the Sulfur Breath, which provides you with pretty much the same power, and cursed potions of cure corruption, potions of raw chaos and cursed scrolls of chaos resistance could corrupt you to the point where you get it. Needless to say, that would be a fairly idiotic method... The normal case is that you develop it by chance at some point and start to use it then. It's one of the corruptions I'd not be in a hurry to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Other skills you can get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Courage&lt;br /&gt;Improves your fighting prowess while being surrounded by removing the penalties you suffer to your to-hit for every enemy except the first standing on one of the eight squares around you. It also reduces the to-hit boni of said enemies. At 100, even being surrounded by eight enemies at once will incur rather low penalties. This skill cannot be gained by choosing any of the races or classes; it's one of the two skills that can only be gotten in-game. To get Courage, you need to complete the quest of the old barbarian living in the clearing near the entrance to Darkforge in Southern Central Drakalor. The first step is to be actually given the quest: To qualify, you need to have killed 500 monsters. That should be doable. If you've done the early game quests and travel westwards to the Caverns of Chaos for the first time, you most certainly will get the Courage quest. A bit harsher are the requirements of the quest itself: You have to kill twenty more of the kind of monster you killed first. The hardest part for most players is probably remembering what the hell that first kill was. Smart players have written it down somewhere or even named themselves after it (extra-smart players type in the name in the "&amp;amp;" monster memory and let the game remember it there). Needless to say, if the monster you need to kill is rare, you'll have a hard time finding twenty of it to complete this quest. It really depends. Should you not know your first kill, the best thing you can do is get the quest, go on about your business crawling through the dungeons and occasionally check back on the old barbarian. Once you have killed enough monsters, he'll teach you sum'thin 'bout Courage. Note that you must not be chaotic if you want to either receive his quest or receive his evaluation - he won't talk to chaotics at all. The Courage skill is not essential - a smart player knows not to be surrounded, and your best action if you are is not to start fighting the monsters around you, but to whip out an Ethereal Bridge spell and get the hell out of there! At least that's the theory. On the other hand, there are levels where you might not have it that easy, so getting the skill is most certainly not a bad idea, but other players happily kill the old barbarian for XP and forget about Courage entirely without being worse off for it (Yes, I'm looking at you, the-one-who-breaks-his-lines-himself-while-typing). Note that the first kill is relevant for another reason - check the Guidebook for that. Courage trains naturally to a good extent, as you often find yourself fighting more than one opponent at a time. You don't need to spend skill advances on it, but Courage always has pretty good dice and can usually quickly be freely trained till 100, so it's certainly a good alternative to having to spend perfectly good skill advances on, say, Haggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Disarm traps&lt;br /&gt;Can be 'a'pplied to disarm door or floor traps. You have to stand adjacent to the square containing the trap. Higher levels improve the chance of success. This skill requires thieves picks to use, which are either found in the pyramid or very rarely from random drops. It costs 3000 to 5000 gold pieces to be taught Disarm traps by Yergius once you enter the Thieves Guild. You have to be level 13 to get the thieves picks from the pyramid as well. Also, you're a spellcaster, and there is a spell called Disarm Traps that sports a 100 percent success rate and trains mana if used. In short, this skill is not worth the money you have to spend on it at all. The only good it does sitting there in your skill list is that it increases the likelihood of your scrolls and potions of education giving you other, more useful skills. That alone might be enough for some, and gold isn't hard to come by, so if you like, get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Law&lt;br /&gt;Will tell you when you've committed a chaotic or lawful act. Only at level 100 will you be told all the time, at lower levels you will not recognize all the acts. This skill can only be obtained if you complete both the Kranach and the Hotzenplotz quests from Tywat Pare. The Kranach quest requires you to kill Kranach, the raider lord (he can be met in a random wilderness encounter as long as you haven't reached level 6) and the Hotzenplotz quest requires you to kill the crime lord of Lawenilothehl and will only be given to you once you reach level 10. If you have managed to kill both of these criminals, Tywat will teach you the law skill in addition to the reward he gives you for killing Hotzenplotz. Killing Hotzenplotz is rather easy as long as you use spells and keep him the hell away from you, but finding Kranach can take an awful shitload of time and killing him and surviving his raiding party isn't trivial for an early game PC (though with smart use of Divine Wrath, it should be doable). All this and the fact that the skill is almost as useless as Haggling, Metallurgy or Disarm traps mean that at least I will lose no sleep not getting this skill. Knowing what constitutes a chaotic act is a no-brainer (hint: killing non-hostiles, robbing graves and wearing amulets of chaos are among the more obvious ones). The same can be said for the few lawful acts the game provides (killing criminals like Hotzenplotz, completing quests, healing injured companions or neutrals, wearing amulets of order). In short, this skill is useless, and unless you want it for the same reason as Disarm traps (though you'd have to want it badly), don't bother getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Pick locks&lt;br /&gt;'A'pply to open locked doors or lock unlocked closed doors. Thieves picks are required. Will bypass traps if successful, but might trigger them if unsuccessful. Can be taught by Yergius if you pay him 3000 to 5000 gold pieces. As has been mentioned under b), you pretty much have to be level 13 to get thieves picks. Like for Disarm Traps, there is a spell that opens locked doors: Divine Key. It's just as common as Disarm traps and even costs a little less PP, on top of that wands of knocking can open doors for you as well. There are also keys to open any door in the game (also disarming all the traps in the process). To top it all off, you can just 'k'ick the door often enough to destroy it, though that will trigger the trap contained. Even if you want to lock a closed door to keep monsters out, there is the Seal of the Spheres spell to do it for you. Pick locks might be more useful if you could get the thieves picks for it more easily, but as it stands, it's just as useless as Disarm traps. Get it to fill up your skill list with useless junk so you get better stuff with potions and scrolls of education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Tactis&lt;br /&gt;Increases the benefits and lowers the penalties for fighting with special tactics other than "Normal". The higher the level, the greater the boni provided, eventually making the Normal stance the least desirable for fighting. This skill is taught by Bart, the grizzled gladiator already mentioned under the skill description for Backstabbing, after you give him the golden gladius. Combine the words "awe" and "some" to get a slight idea of the value of this skill. If there is any skill worth getting in this section, it most certainly is this one. As a spellcaster, you will (in crucial situations at least) cast all your spells in coward mode, and having Tactics at a decent level will increase your DV in that mode by far more than the Dodge skill can get you. On the other hand, if brute force is required, switching to berserk coupled with a good Tactics skill will make you able to rip your opponent to even more shreds. Did I already mention that you should get this skill under any circumstances? Win the arena, trade in your golden gladius with a happy smile and receive two (for orcs one) extra skills to go with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Two weapon combat&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the to-hit and attacking speed penalties received for fighting with two weapons. The higher the level, the better your dual-wielding. This is yet another skill you get if you give the golden gladius to Bart. As for its value... Needless to say, if you don't plan on using two weapons, every skill point spent on this skill is a waste; if you do consider fighting with two weapons, get this as high as ever possible, as without a very high Two weapon combat skill dual-wielding is tremendously inferior to the weapon and shield or the two-handed weapon route. Even with the skill at 100, at least for a Druid such as yourself, dual-wielding is still a bad choice. You might be able to attack more often in the same time, but you will always attack twice and thus take more time in each turn, meaning you are less able to react. On top of that, you forgo using a shield, which will deal a hefty blow to your possible DV. Also, having two reasonably powerful attacks compared to having one insanely powerful attack (such as that of an eternium two-handed sword) means you have to overcome the PV twice and might end up with less damage than with the one two-handed weapon. As long as you don't use Needle &amp;amp; Sting (which get such great bonuses if used together in Two weapon combat that they're almost always worth it) or some other insanely powerful melee weapons (like eternium weapons of penetration, which bypass PV, and may be worth attacking with twice if you can avoid getting hit too much), don't fight with two weapons unless you really want to because you think it's cooler or whatever. If you don't dual-wield - as has been said, don't increase the skill. Sooner or later the time will come where you have skill advances you don't know how to spend, and Two weapon combat will probably still be a better choice than Haggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Talents&lt;br /&gt;Check the guidebook for complete and detailed information. The ADOM manual itself will also tell you about the prerequisites of the talents, so go there if you want to avoid the temptation of perusing spoily sections of the guidebook. I will offer my opinion on the talents available nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Druid, you will usually start with two or three starting talents, sometimes one, sometimes four. The theoretical maximum is five. This means at least 17 talents. There are combinations of talents that provide quite a significant bonus. You won't be able to get all the potentially useful talents, though, so you have to make decisions. These decisions should be based on the playing style of your Druid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here's the talents I would consider taking. If a talent has been mentioned several times, that means it's a part of different "talent chains". You only have to get it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alert, Miser, Treasure Hunter (because I love treasure), Potent Aura, Charged (extra PP regeneration), Long Stride (It helps escaping by improving your movement speed), Quick, Very Quick, Greased Lightning (speed is very important), Careful, Defensive Fighter, Very Careful, Dodger, Shield Specialist, Shield Expert, Shield Master (extra DV is very helpful, take as many of these as you want), Porter, Master Packager, Beast of Burden (so you can carry lots of helpful equipment without getting burdened as much), Good Shot, Keen Shot, Eagle Eye (Extra missile damage, slaying missiles will become even more effective with these, you need Archery for Eagle Eye, though), Good Shot, Keen Shot, Quick, Quick Shot, Lightning Shot (the last two increase your missile attacking speed; these talents are very powerful, though Lightning Shot also requires Archery), Basher, Powerful Strike, Mighty Strike (if and only if you find yourself using a weapon that weighs 100 stones or more primarily - if you do, very much recommended), Potent Aura, Strong Healer (if you find healing spells early, this might save your life), Hardy, Tough Skin, Iron Skin, Steel Skin, Mithril Skin (can be very helpful if you get them early on, later in the game probably a waste. Only dwarves can get Mithril Skin, so it's a bit more worthwhile for them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stand-alone talents include Long-Lived, which can only be chosen in the beginning and increases your lifespan by 30 percent. For orcs and trolls especially, this might safe you from death at the hands of ghost aging attacks. Also potentially life-saving is Healthy, which can be chosen anytime and increases HP regeneration, though only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the talents that can only be gotten when you start out with your character, only Alert and Long-Lived are mentioned in the list above. In my opinion, the others aren't worth considering; Strong might be the best of the lot. The Heir talent, which requires three starting talents (Charming, Boon to the Family, and Heir itself) grants you a yellow leather armor of balance, which is essentially the same as the leather armor you're likely to start out with anyway (dwarves and orcs even get studded leather armor, which is superior). It gives shock resistance and draws your alignment towards neutral over time - two effects that may be useful in certain circumstances, but lumped together on a shitty armor are hardly of any use. The armor isn't worth wearing, and you can't even equip it in case you meet a lightning vortex because changing body armor takes so much time! For three talents, you can get Hardy, Tough Skin and Iron Skin instead, netting you two points of PV added to your starting armor AND three max HP! Much better, and there are talents even more useful than that! If you get Heir as a Druid, don't ever tell me about it. I'm losing too much hair as it is; I don't want to tear out more in despair over how stupid the people on this world can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line of all this? Well, since there is only one dedicated starting talent you need for the talent chains recommended above, there's no reason to worry about the number of starting talents at all. Trolls and orcs might be faced with the dilemma of choosing between Alert and Long-Lived. I'd take Alert anyway, but it's best to secure an extra talent by playing a Druid born in Candle or Falcon. Note that Long Stride and Quick are prime candidates for the very early game, because a speed of over 100 or higher movement speed will enable you to run from most monsters. You might think running is against your principles and something only cowards do. I'm not saying that running isn't cowardly, but I'll say this: Running means you don't die. The key to winning ADOM is to learn not to die. Running is a valuable method of achieving just that, and you'll do yourself a big favour if you remember this. As mentioned, Hardy and the extra PV talents are also something you should choose early on, because PV is quite a bit more valuable in the early to mid game than DV. The other talents tend to be useful well into the late game, and thus can be chosen anytime, maybe with the exception of Strong Healer, which isn't really worth much if you have potions of extra or ultra healing or the Heal spell for emergency healing purposes later in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Spells&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as this is the only spellcaster guide I'll likely ever write, I will try and give you my opinion on all the spells in the game. If that's too much detail for you, just scroll down! The spells will be divided into groups, and discussed in comparison to other spells in the group, if applicable. Spells that are considered "clerical" are noted with a (C). Since your Druid is a divine spellcaster, he will be able to increase in effectivity in these spells twice as fast as in the purely arcane spells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Healing spells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Light Wounds (C): The most basic of all the healing spells, and also the cheapest to cast. There are voices that say, quite reasonably so, that this is the most valuable healing spell you can have. This is due to the fact that it is the most common, the easiest to learn, and thus the one you can cast most often - which leads to higher effectivity ratings. Higher effectivity means a cheaper Cure Light Wounds healing more damage. Very high effectivity Cure Light Wounds oftentimes heals just as much damage as Cure Serious or even Critical Wounds, costing a third less PP! The effectiveness of this spell even at low levels is very respectable with the help of Strong Healer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Serious Wounds (C): More powerful than Cure Light Wounds. A bit rarer and harder to learn and more costly in PP. However, it's entirely possible, thanks to the randomness of ADOM, that you find lots of books of Cure Serious Wounds and no Cure Light Wounds - making Cure Serious Wounds the preferable spell. In the end, any healing spell will do wonders if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Critical Wounds (C): More powerful than Cure Serious Wounds. Only marginally rarer than Cure Serious Wounds and more costly in PP. As has been said already, every one of the Healing spells is wonderful to have, all you need is one of them, the earlier the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heal (C): The most powerful of all the healing spells. The rarest, and most expensive, and hardest to learn. This is a spell reserved for emergencies. For everyday healing, the other spells will do fine - you don't need to heal 150 HP in one go instead of 30 HP in five goes if there is no especially hard-hitting opponent near. For emergency healing, blessed potions of extra or ultra healing are more reliable, though, leaving this spell with hardly a job to do. Still, it's good to cover emergencies doubly or triply - you might contract poison hands in an untimely moment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Disease (C): The effect should be rather obvious. This is one of the many ways to cure diseases, and laughably easy to use. Pay the low spell cost, and your problems are solved. If you find this spell early, it can save your life. Other ways to cure diseases include the curaria mancox herb, preferably blessed potions of healing, extremely lucky First Aid rolls and divine favors (though you should be warned not to rely on that to work - the gods tend to heal HP instead of sickness if they can, and being sick takes away HP at the beginning of every round if you're not at 50% HP or below. They might heal your sickness, or they might heal your HP instead, which are brought down again, leaving you with no choice but to pray again... and again...). Having a high number of castings in this spell (or a respectable stash of curaria mancox) is one of the prerequisites for sickness stat training (which is an exploit I shall not explain here - down that path the dark side lurks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutralize Poison (C): Neutralizes a certain amount of poison dependant on your spell effectivity. This spell has a weakness: If you're poisoned a lot, it won't heal you all the way, but usually (hopefully) enough to make you survive to the next round, where you can cast the spell again. In most situations, this spell will be able to deal with the poison, but personally I feel the next spell in this section is a bit more reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow Poison (C): Heavily weakens *all* the poison in your body. After casting this spell, you usually take one point or two of poison damage, tops, and a few turns later you've gotten rid of the rest through natural healing. My experience tells me that this is the best way to get rid of poison. Blessed alraunia antidote or blessed potions of cure poison come close, but Slow Poison, especially if cast twice, removes any danger even the most potent poison may poise, er, pose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Touch damage spells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baptism of Fire (C): The only elemental touch damage spell. Affects everyone except those resistant or immune to fire. The damage is respectable, especially once this spell has been trained a lot. Which is easy, since it is among the cheapest spells in the Druid's arsenal, and very common and easy to learn. The fact that it only affects one opponent - the one standing right next to you - makes it the spell of choice if there's only one enemy to kill, or when you don't want to risk bolt spells bouncing around. Another advantage of Baptism of Fire is that it can't be shrugged off. Yet another advantage is that it destroys no items, not even those on the square that's hit. Sadly, there are no non-fire equivalents of this spell, meaning against fire resistant or immune enemies, you have to default back to bolt or ball spells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bless (C): This spell only hurts undead. If you hit anyone not undead, including yourself, with it, they will be blessed instead, which adds a bit of to-hit, damage, DV and PV (making Bless an enchantment as well). The guideline is simple. Use this on undead, yourself or companions. Barring an undead slaying weapon or another kind of powerful melee weapon, this is among the best ways to deal with undead. It has the advantage, compared to melee weapons, that you can cast it to full effect in coward mode. It has the disadvantage that it can be shrugged off, just like melee weapons can miss. High effectivity is a must if you want to use Bless on dangerous opponents. Thankfully, there is no shortage of standard issue undead to practice on, and you can - and there's no reason why you shouldn't - keep blessing yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispel Undead (C): Closely related to Bless, of course, only that it doesn't double as a buff. I might be fooled, but I think it's a bit harder to learn than Bless, yet the damage is higher. All in all, both are about equal in the destroying undead department. It might be wise to specialize in either of them so you have maximum effectivity, because Destroy Undead can be shrugged off just like Bless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrification (C): Strictly speaking, this is a touch spell that doesn't do damage, but turns enemies into stone. Which is essentially an instadeath, so it deserves to be listed here. This spell is hard to learn, and costs a shitload of PP to cast. As a rule of thumb, the more powerful the foe, the lower the chance of success. There are some dangerous opponents against which it has a very high chance of success, though. Generally, if it doesn't shrug off bolt spells, it won't be able to resist petrification. Killer bugs are a prime example of an opponent this spell works wonders against, as are all the small fry that you could kill by blowing your nose at them. A minor side bonus of successfully using this spell is the resulting statue, which you can kick down, sometimes yielding a magical wand, or wield as a melee weapon if you feel like adding a bit more badass to the Druid way of life. In the end, this spell is generally too unreliable for the PP it costs, so you won't use it much, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Enchantments (spells that affect people without causing damage to them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm Monster (C): This spell only really comes into play in the early game. Usually, the best course of action if you encounter a hostile monster is to kill it for XP. You only might want to calm a hostile monster if you either can't or don't want to kill it. This mostly applies to cats or monsters that are too powerful for you to kill. For cats Calm Monster works wonders, though it might take some uses to calm the cat down, enabling you to make a run for it. Powerful monsters tend to laugh in your face and kill you anyway. Because cats are rarely hostile anyway to your Druid, this spell easily makes the top ten of being useless. It doesn't cost much PP, though, is rather common and easy to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy Awe (C): May make the targetted monster panic and run away. As has been explained in the description for Calm Monster, you will want to kill monsters except for the two exceptions of cats and powerful monsters. Likewise, against cats this spell works well, against powerful monsters it has slim chances of success. At about the same level of uselessness as Calm Monster, and similarly easy to find, learn and cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow Monster: The first purely arcane spell in my list. It also happens to be one of the most useful of all the spells available to you. You can cast it on monsters to slow them to half their usual speed, meaning they will only act half the time in a battle, essentially halving their power. It has a chance of failure, though. You can also cast Slow Monster on yourself. This sounds like it is something only a retarded chimp would even consider doing. And it is - except if one knows that the experience a character receives in battle is dependent on his speed. The faster a character is, the less XP will he gain from killing his enemies. Why that is so is mysterious - I think it's related to the fact that if you move faster, you have more difficulties perceiving your surroundings or something like that. What matters is that this actually works the other way around - if you slow yourself using Slow Monster, and kill someone, you will get a great deal more XP. If you do this right before dealing the finishing blow on an enemy that would yield loads of XP, you will get awesome motherfucking assloads of XP. Is this an exploit? Possibly. Personally I'd say a trollish Druid would have every right to use this method; the others don't exactly need it. Popular monsters to kill while being slowed include the water dragon, Nuurag-Vaarn, greater molochs, or anything powerful you can deal with slowed. A bit rarer than Calm Monster or Holy Awe and a bit harder to learn, but still not a very demanding spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veil of the Gods: Makes the target invisible. Works on you, works on enemies. Why you would use it on enemies is beyond me, so we're probably talking about you here. If you're invisible, you will not be found and hit by enemies you haven't attacked yourself, except if your enemies can see invisible. Which ones these are is something you might find out too late, but mostly you're safe. Killer bugs and greater claw bugs see invisible - beware. Enemies you haven't attacked that can't see you might try to move on your square, but instead of hitting you they will seem to search for someone or something, utterly incapable of finding you ever. However, if you attack them, they will instantly know how to find you - forever. Bottom line: If relying on invisibility in a dangerous place, choose your enemies carefully! About the same level of rarity as Slow Monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farsight (C): Cannot be targeted: You will instantly receive the benefits of this enchantment. Basically, it drastically enhances your line of sight. This is a very valuable spell in the right situations especially later on, when bolt spells and missile weapons have very far range that'd otherwise go virtually unused. Usually, you won't find enough Farsight books to cast it again and again to make it a "permanent" effect for the rest of the game, but you don't need to do that. Popular places to be farsighted include most greater vaults, elemental temples, and long corridors with powerful monsters at the other end, and especially the Mana Temple; firstly because longer sight range means a greater area of effect for your wands of trap detection, secondly so you can see the Archmage from the entrance. About as common as Veil of the Gods, and rather cheap for the late game, when it is worth the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lordly Might: Like with Farsight, you are automatically the target of this spell. There are two approaches to this spell. The first one is to cast it and constantly recast it so you can carry around obscene amounts of equipment with you. Very effective, powerful, and convenient - as long as you take care to recast it once you're warned of the ending of the spell's duration. Which brings us to the second approach: Only to cast it when you need to, and in all other cases go without it. I'm a follower of the second approach, simply because I want to avoid the very embarassing death the PC dies if you forget to recast the spell while carrying around said obscene amounts of equipment. I use Lordly Might if I want to carry a whole lot of loot to sell to the next shop, or for all other temporary uses that could be imagined, with the emphasis on temporary. Carrying around useless junk is not something a smart adventurer should engage in, and the effect of Lordly Might easily creates the temptation to be sloppy. Which in turn can cost the lives of otherwise nigh-invincible characters. If you are a careful player, use Lordly Might however you want, but it should be clear that you need a respectable stock of castings of Lordly Might for it to last throughout your game. The book is a bit rarer than the ones mentioned above, and you need to be a pretty good learner to get good castings out of one book, but the spell isn't expensive to cast - if push comes to shove, the HP hit of casting it without any PP left is easily absorbed. Note that the durations of Lordly Might stack - you can cast it several times in a row to make it last longer. Of course, this makes it easier for you to accidentally hit away the warnings since it's less likely that you will be expecting them after such a long time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Divinations (Spells that grant you information)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know Alignment (C): Cast this spell on anyone you like to find out his, her or its alignment. You only need to know the alignment of a monster if you want to sacrifice it on a neutral or lawful altar; deities of both alignments hate it if you sacrifice coaligned creatures on their altars. Know Alignment helps you find out which monster you can sacrifice and which you can't. Apart from that, it's completely and utterly useless, especially since the alignment is dependant on creature type - know the alignment of one, and you know the alignment of all the others, for the rest of all your games. If you are fairly new to ADOM and still want to engage in hardcore monster sacrificing (which, let me advise you, really should be mutually exclusive), you probably need Know Alignment, but apart from that, no. At least it's one of the easiest spells to learn and costs almost nothing in PP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlightenment (C): Identifies an item, revealing its basic statistics (like its name and the boni it gives to DV, PV, to-hit, damage, or stats), and enabling you to recognize this item if you stumble across it again later (most of the times, necklaces tend to be hard to recognize for some reason). This spell costs a lot to cast and is fairly hard to learn and hard to find, and it has only the effect of a cursed scroll of identify. If you have gathered a big bunch o' loot that needs to be identified, you're better off just using one of your blessed scrolls of identify instead of casting this spell over and over. If it's only a few items that need identifying, and using a scroll feels like a waste, cast Enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greater Enlightenment (C): Does not identify several items, it greater identifies *one* item. Greater identifying reveals all there is to know about one item, most importantly intrinsics like the various resistances and immunities, or whether the item dooms you or makes Fate smile upon you, and explanations of a magical effect that go beyond its name. You should greater identify all artifacts that you haven't seen before to learn their properties. I'm not sure whether Greater Enlightenment really does work as reliable as a blessed scroll of greater identify and reveal any magical property without fail; you might need to cast it several times on an item to really know all the properties. A very useful spell, especially once you've run out of the rare scroll of greater identify. You can also decide on simply looking up all the artifact statistics on the intarweb (*cough* Guidebook *cough*), in which case you need neither the scroll nor the spell, but that's a bit cheap, isn't it? Greater Identify is even more expensive to cast than Enlightenment, and very rare and quite hard to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revelation (C): Similar to Greater Enlightenment, but it doesn't reveal intrinsics of an item. Rather, it reveals all the magical intrinsics you possess, along with your HP and PP regeneration rates. In the early game, this isn't a very useful effect - you start out with zero intrinsics usually. The longer you play the game, however, and devour corpses and drink from pools and so on, the harder it is to keep track of the intrinsics you have gained at some point. Sure, you could write them all down on some sheet of paper, but it's always more reliable to just cast Revelation periodically, especially since there are corpses that give you an intrinsic only part of the time, like fire beetle corpses. Want to gamble on whether you actually got fire resistance from it or not when you meet a fire vortex? There you are. It isn't hard to learn or find, but expensive to cast, and it takes AGES to learn it. The time you spend reading a book of Revelation once is similar to the time you spend on reading ball spells or Greater Divine Touch or something along those lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowledge of the Ancients (C): Reveals part of the dungeon map. How much of the map is revealed is heavily influenced by the spell effectivity. The usefulness of this effect cannot be overstated, especially late in the game, and most especially in the Minotaur Maze. It's a bit hard to learn, expensive to cast and rare to find, which is a shame, as practice really helps a lot with this spell. If you must know the exact layout of a level instantly, use a blessed scroll of magic mapping instead. Scrolls of magic mapping should always be used blessed, especially if you have this spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Alterations (Spells that somehow manipulate objects)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine Key: Opens doors. Whether they are locked or trapped doesn't matter, they only need to be closed so they can be opened. Locks are unlocked, traps defused (thankfully). Very cheap to cast, very easy to find and learn. One of the most basic spells ever. Its usefulness is hindered by the fact that doors can be kicked down or opened with keys or wands of knocking. Especially later on, you may have more charges of wands of knocking than you will need. Not useless, but very unimportant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seal of the Spheres: Locks doors. This is a tad bit more useful than Divine Key. The only other ways to lock a closed door are either with the appropriate key or with the Pick Locks skill (which you probably won't bother to get). You will want to lock doors to keep whatever is behind them behind them. Many of the more brute monsters can smash doors, but the others will be utterly incapable to get through that door if it is locked. The Seal of the Spheres spell is the most reliable way to lock any door - you can run out of keys or just don't have the right key for the door, and Pick Locks has a chance of failure. One-hundred percent reliability is very important because you might want this spell to save your life one day! It's only slightly rarer and harder to learn than Divine Key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove Curse (C): Uncurses a single item. It has the effect of an uncursed scroll of uncursing, which is okay, but of course inferior to the awesome power of the blessed scroll of uncursing. Still very nice to have if you really only want to uncurse a single item, and don't want to waste your scrolls of uncursing. It's about as hard to learn and find and expensive to cast as Enlightenment. This spell cannot remove a curse from yourself - you need divine support, a karmic creature corpse or a scroll of luck for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethereal Bridge: Teleports the target to somewhere on the dungeon level. It can only teleport living beings, though, whyever that is. One of the most important spells in the game, and a must in any spellcaster's repertoire. If you cast it on yourself, you are randomly teleported like any other target, except if you possess the teleport control intrinsic. This intrinsic can be gotten from a pool, by eating a blink dog corpse, or by wearing an amulet or ring of teleport control (certain artifacts might help, too). If you have teleport control, this spell becomes five times more useful, since you will be able to use it as a dedicated method of travel, not just an emergency measure. There are many uses to "on-demand" teleportation, especially if you know your way around the dungeons. There are secret locations that can only ever be visited by teleporting. Having learnt Ethereal Bridge provides one with the greatest stash of teleport spells, but you can also teleport (only yourself) with the help of scrolls of teleportation, or teleport yourself and others with the wand of teleportation (which is rare, but guaranteed to be found in one place), or generate a teleport trap with a wand of trap creation. You can recharge wands, so the Ethereal Bridge spell isn't a must - but is most certainly a should, especially if you happen to catch the nasty mana battery corruption. This spell is in the medium range of rarity and difficulty to learn and cast - you should keep the book for reading to the end later if you find it early. Read it nonetheless - an early-found Ethereal Bridge can save your ass so hard it's not even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine Digger (C): Digs a tunnel through stone in one of the eight directions, or digs a pit or up a grave if you press 5. Its effect is the same as the wand of digging, only that the range of effect of the wand of digging is governed by its blessed/uncursed/cursed status, not your willpower. There aren't many cases where you need or would like to be able to dig, but in these cases, using Divine Digger is as good a method as any. It's useless for mining, just like the wand - mining has to be done with a pickaxe. This spell takes some time and is pretty hard to learn, and at about the rarity of Remove Curse or Enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthquake (C): A spell of great effect, but restricted use. Earthquaking a level, apart from putting yourself in danger, mainly creates an assload of rocks and makes the dungeon level an open field. It also damages all the monsters that were hit by rocks by the earthquake, but rarely enough to kill them. Earthquake isn't really good for anything, especially if you don't need the rocks, which is the case for 99% of Druids worldwide. The only thing it has going for it is the fact that it usually enables you to get anywhere in the dungeon. If you lack other, less destructive sources of digging, Earthquake is an alternative - if the level isn't immune to earthquakes, of course. It's very hard to learn and expensive to cast, however, and I advise you not to be careless using it, if you use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disarm Trap (C): Disarms a trap, making it vanish out of existence. You don't even need to see it - if you suspect there might be a trap in the square next to you, but have no way of finding out save stepping on it, you can cast Disarm Traps on the square and it will be disarmed (without yielding any message at all - if you use it on a non-trapped square, you get a message along the lines of "Nothing happens, the spell is wasted", so you will know when you were successful in disarming a trap by the lack of any response. Tricky, huh?). A useful spell in heavily-trapped areas, and very helpful in everyday adventuring especially when coupled with the Detect Traps skill. For door traps Divine Key works fine, though. This spell is one-hundred percent reliable and thus hugely superior to the Disarm Traps skill. On top of that, it's cheap, easy to learn, and not that hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Summonings (Spells that summon things into existence out of nowhere)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light (C): Conjures bright light in a certain radius around the caster. This light removes darkness, be it from the source of a spell or natural, and damages gremlins. This is the cheapest spell in existence, and after a bit of effectivity costs maybe three or two points of PP. Apart from being the most efficient way to deal with gremlin infestations, it's simply useful if you want your dungeons non-dark. There are scrolls, wands and even an artifact to duplicate the effect, and constant light sources like torches or an amulet of light will be more useful against opponents that regularly cast Darkness in battle. So, all in all, very basic and not very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkness: Often underestimated and underused, many players call this the most useful non-damaging spell in the game. This is due to the fact that many opponents fight very poorly in the darkness - or not at all. Vortices, most importantly, will not explode in the darkness in most of the cases, even if you attack them they might stay calm until you kill them. Monsters will not be able to follow you out of the darkness easily, so you can cast Darkness, run out and hopefully leave behind the monster that is on your toes. Apart from enemies not being able to attack you, enemies also rarely will use spells or elemental attacks on you. In general, fighting in darkness has a lot of advantages that outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to see in most cases, at least if fighting in a confined, previously explored space. It's a cheap spell to cast, and very common. Dangerous opponents that Darkness effectively cripples include doppleganger kings, doppleganger kings and doppleganger kings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summon Monsters (C): Summons a number of monsters dependant on spell effectivity. This sounds cool until you realize that these monsters all behave like normal monsters - they want to beat the crap out of you, rob you or eat you. That also explains why it's rather cheap to cast and easy to learn. This spell may be useful very late in the game, when you want to have some meat shields so you aren't surrounded by as many of the really dangerous monsters, or at any point if you want to kill some monsters for XP without having to walk around to look for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine Favour (C): Creates an item. What kind of item? That depends on where you are. If you are deep down in a dangerous dungeon, it may create a very powerful item. It also may create a hat or brass bracers or something similarly useless, regardless of where you cast it. The PP cost is hefty, and the spell is rare and hard to learn. In the end, this spell does nothing what killing some more monsters wouldn't do as well - and you don't get XP for casting it! Good if you just want to cast some spells to train your mana, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish: This spell is not documented in the manual. Very suspicious, isn't it? What does it do? Simple - it grants you a wish. You'll be able to wish for almost any item you want, except for artifacts. You can also wish for stats, skills and even monsters. Wishes are the most awesome and helpful thing in the ADOM universe. Where's the catch? you may ask. Well, as you can imagine, the spellbook of Wish is very rare, but not impossible to find. Sadly, finding it is a lot easier than successfully reading it, which in turn is a lot easier than casting it without dying. Once you've found a spellbook, stuff yourself full of food and/or find a dungeon room of which the air is filled with a very rich flavor. Learn the spell. Then look at the PP cost and recollect your dropped jaw. How can anyone even survive casting Wish? Be assured that it takes a lot of effort to gather the HP and PP needed. You should also be aware that even if you do manage to cast wish without dying, doing so will take away 10 points from one of your stats. Bottom line? As long as you don't plan on creating an archmage, only ever consider going through the trouble of successfully casting wish if you need a certain item and absolutely fail to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Straight line bolt spells (Bolt spells that fizzle if they hit a wall or door)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hellish Flames (C): Casts a bolt of fire. This spell will  burn enemies that aren't resistant or immune to fire or shrug off the bolt, cook corpses, destroy already cooked corpses and items vulnerable to fire (which are a lot). It is a solid and easy to learn bolt spell capable of dealing with most opponents, but the item destruction is considerable. It won't damage items that are still in the possession of a living monster, though, even if the monster is killed by it, so if there are no items you care about lying around, it's safe to use. Of course, Hellish Flames really shines if you meet a tension room or vault chock full of white dragons or frost giants. However, foes resistant to fire in turn are rather common. For any of the bolt spells, spell effectivity is very important, as they can all be shrugged off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nether Bolt (C): Casts a cone of ice. Marginally less damaging than Hellish Flames, but quite a bit more vital in my opinion, for several reasons: First, it has a much lower rate of item destruction - in fact, it only drenches scrolls and spellbooks and shatters potions, leaving all other items intact. Second, it can create an ice bridge if you cast it over a square of water next to you. Ice bridges can be destroyed by fire spells, and they break if you carry more than 2000 stones of weight with you, but they are a lot less of a hassle to create than bridges made of wood with the Bridge Building skill. Third, it is enormously helpful in the Tower of Eternal Flames, which is a dangerous place for any character. There are fewer monsters resistant to cold than to fire as well. Train it so it doesn't get shrugged off as often if you intend to use it as a major source of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acid Bolt (C): Does considerably more damage than Hellish Flames or Nether Bolt, but is also more expensive to cast. There are few opponents resistant to acid. For some opponents, acid is the only one of the four elemental spell types that can hurt them. This includes Nuurag-Vaarn and Yulgash, though they tend to shrug off Acid Bolts a lot anyway. This spell is rarer than the other elemental bolts and harder to learn, so it tends to become used less, and once Hellish Flames, Nether Bolt or Divine Wrath have been trained a bit, they deal as much damage while having a lower chance of being shrugged off. That's why Acid Bolt, despite its theoretical superiority over the other elemental bolts, gets fewer use. It destroys items just as much as Hellish Flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web: Flies until the range ends or a wall is hit, like the other spells in this section. Instead of doing damage, it creates webs whereever it flew. If it hits an enemy, he has a high chance of shrugging off the web, but if he doesn't, he will instantly be entangled. The webs created with this spell cannot be shrugged off, however - they will stop anyone stepping in them for a random couple of rounds, giving you time to shoot at it with other spells. Just don't make it Hellish Flames, as that spell burns away webs. It's cheap to cast and rather common, and thanks to its popularity among adventurers dealing with dangerous adversaries that hit like a ton of bricks in melee, but carry no distance attack, it comes in a wand version, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Bouncing bolt spells (Bolt spells that bounce off walls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these spells are tricky to use, and require a good eye and practice. They will fly as far as their Range is, and continue even after hitting a wall (the distance that remains to be crossed is reduced by one for every time the spell bounces off a wall). The best way to kill oneself is to let one of these spells fly straight against a wall. You should be aware of the range of your spells, and keep that much divided by two spaces distance to a wall if you want to cast the spell at it. Bouncing bolts can also hit enemies more than one time, so their volatile nature has its benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine Wrath (C): Your starting spell as a Druid. It casts a bolt of lightning. Enemies resistant or immune to lightning are very rare, especially in the early game, and the spell packs enough punch to mess up all your opposition early on. It remains useful as a standard bolt spell on the level of Hellish Flames or Nether Bolt later in the game. There aren't many enemies especially vulnerable to Divine Wrath - but there is a very notable example: Steel golems. These can seriously lay waste to PCs below level 20 if you don't have means of effectively killing them, and Lightning Bolt is one of the best ways if you have trained it to decent effectivity. It destroys about the same items as Hellish Flames and Acid Bolt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor Punishment: The best bolt spell there is, period. It does the least amount of damage, granted, but it also costs the least amount of PP, is the easiest to learn, causes zero destruction of items (!), and hurts any creature in the game with full power (!!). The latter two effects, as you may have deduced from the exclamation marks attributed to them, are made of win and awesome. It's a real shame this is an arcane spell; it makes it harder for the Druid to get it to high effectivity, where it can lay waste to greater molochs, ancient karmic dragons, simply everything. If there are no items around and the enemy can be hurt by one of the elemental spells, save your Minor Punishments for later. Just keep in mind that one thing: Minor Punishment kills everything - eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesser Divine Touch (C): Shoots a ray that stuns enemies in its wake that don't shrug off the ray. Being stunned makes an enemy stagger around aimlessly, making them unable to use spells, missile attacks, or anything else that's not staggering and hitting people by accident. Very cool effect. Sadly, Lesser Divine Touch is next to useless in a pinch if it hasn't been trained. It isn't hard to train it - the books are rather common, and it's cheap to cast - but you have to invest some time in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greater Divine Touch (C): Shoots a ray that instantly kills all that it hits, unless they shrug it off or are in some way resistant to it. It's very hard to hit powerful enemies with this, which is as it should be. It's also very hard to learn and costs an assload of PP to cast, which also is as it should be. This spell truly works wonders against killer bugs, though. Above all else, be enormously careful when using this spell. It bounces, so it can in theory hit you, and unless you are resistant do death rays, that means, well, death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Ball spells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Punishment: A fire ball spell. The cheapest of the ball spells, and a nice thing to have. All the ball spells, sadly, are arcane, meaning you have a harder time training them to higher efficiency. The good news is that these spells cannot be shrugged off, so effectivity doesn't matter as much. While Baptism of Flame is for single opponents, and fire bolt for those who have lined up, Major Punishment is the spell when you are right in the middle of the action. It affects all the eight squares around you at least, and if you surpass certain Willpower thresholds, the area of effect increases! The first of these thresholds occurs at a willpower score of 32. You can definitely get there if you use the right tactics and equipment. To increase the area of effect further, much higher scores are required, necessitating pretty specialized and extreme tactics. For everyday purposes, the plain ball spell is pretty good, and the 32 willpower one is brutal. As has been mentioned, Major Punishment is fire. There are quite a number of fire resistant enemies especially further down in the dungeons. All undead and of course white dragons and wyrms, of course, make excellent targets. Beware of the item destruction, however - all squares in your area of effect will be affected. This is true for squares behind a wall or a door as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freezing Fury: The ice ball spell. It's a bit more expensive than Major Punishment and a bit less brutal in damage, but still very impressive, and the perfect way to deal with fire creatures of all kinds. Having the Freezing Fury spell upon entrance into the Tower of Eternal Flames will help you tremendously, and every fire creature greater vault will succumb to your awesome power. This spell has less item destruction than other ball spells due to being an ice effect. Mostly, only scrolls, potions and books are affected by ice - valuable items, but at least it leaves the wands, girdles of giant strength and seven league boots alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavenly Fury: The lightning ball spell. More powerful than Major Punishment, costing more in PP, and very decent. Lightning resistant enemies are rarer than fire resistant ones. It does have the same level of item destruction. There are few noteworthy enemies especially vulnerable to lightning, though - the spell totally wastes steel golems, but apart from that it is of medium impact for a ball spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain of Sorrow: The acid ball spell. Damage wise, this is the most powerful spell in the game. And on top of that, acid is the rarest resistance, and most importantly, almost none of the really hard opponents resist it despite resisting the other three elements. There is also no one especially vulnerable to acid, but that is irrelevant due to its inherently extreme damage. It destroys items just like Major Punishment, but you shouldn't use it to clear masses of monsters like the other ball spells - keep your Rain of Sorrow castings for the likes of Yulgash, Nuurag-Vaarn or pretty much everything that proves a bit stroppy. It is said that not even an ElDeR cHaOs GoD can resist the sheer destructiveness of this spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoked Devastation: Another kind of fire ball spell. Instead of a standard Major Punishment, which affects the squares around you, it is hurled at the target of your choice, detonating upon reaching the goal or upon impact. This has the very cool effect that you can use it at a distance - emperor liches in particular are good opponents to have this spell to deal with. It has the slightly less cool effect that you can hit yourself with it. The other ball spells ignore the square you are standing on, but if you are in the radius of an Invoked Devastation hurled by you, you will take damage and item destruction. If you are resistant or even immune to fire and possess proper equipment to prevent your stuff from being damaged, you can ignore that and happily hurl your Invoked Devastations whereever you want. A special note for drakeling druids: This is the only way to hit yourself with a fire spell. You might want to keep this in mind should you be exposed to extreme cold. Apart from the Invoked Devastation spell, only alchemical blunders and fire crystals hurled by a sling to the square directly next to you are viable methods, at least if you don't want to rely on finding fire-based monsters to be attacked by. This spell does not come in versions for the other elements - you have to fall back on standard ball spells and bolt spells against the fire resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This closes the section on spells. Is there still advice to give? Well, the bleeding obvious: Be economical with your castings, especially of the ball spells. As a Druid, you are not the best book learner around - you are very good, but you pale in comparison to the wizard. So keep your Rain of Sorrows around for the really critical cases. If you find especially many books of Rain of Sorrow, or wish for them (a smart move), you can afford to use some of your castings for training, but the highest efficiency ratings won't help much if you run out of your spells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a similar note, do not sell bolt spellbooks unless you positively swim in them. Read them all to death, and use them all to death (more specifically, to the death of your opposition). High effectivity, especially for bolt spells, helps so much it's not even funny. You can go the melee or missile route halfway effectively, but at your very heart, you're a spellcaster, even if your spellcasting related class powers suck donkey dick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IV. Equipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Melee weapons&lt;br /&gt;Does a Druid need a good melee weapon? In the most cases, the answer is yes. The problem with Druids is that they have to pay rather high PP costs for their spells, especially compared to priests and wizards, and that they start with very low Literacy for a spellcaster. In the early game, you simply can't spellcast your way through your opposition like a wizard can pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;Even later on, a good melee weapon is still important. It should always but in very few cases be a one-handed one so you can wear a shield with it. A good choice to specialize in is the spear, because they are one-handed members of the polearm weapon class, which gives the second highest DV bonus for weapon skill levels, second only to staves - and these don't allow shields to be worn. You can find good spears very early if you let orc scorchers throw theirs at you (don't worry - they aim like idiots). The orcish spear deals two more damage than the standard spear trap spear and will be the best spear you will likely have until you find higher metal spears. The trouble with spears is their low damage especially later on - if you don't find something like an eternium spear of devastation, you'll be at the low end of the spectrum compared to stuff like maces of destruction or swords of sharpness. The spear/shield combo is still the prime numero uno choice for pure spellcasters, as they can make excellent use of DV, but do not care one iota about melee damage. This is worth considering if your plans for your Druid in the later game go that way.&lt;br /&gt;Quite obviously, there is another route you can take: damage-dealing. However, lacking one-handed melee weapons worth anything as crowning gift artifacts, you will have to find your damage-dealing capabilities in-game. The only really hefty weapon guaranteed to be found is the lead-filled mace "Big Punch", an artifact you will receive as reward if you defeat the greater daemon in Dwarftown for the last Thrundarr quest. It does weigh an awful lot, but it deals loads of damage - and its high weight makes it compatible with the Basher talents. Apart from Big Punch, you pretty much have to rely on randomly finding (or getting precrowned with) the more powerful one-handed artifact weapons, like Executor, Skullcrusher or Serpent's Bite. A mace of destruction, being the most damaging non-artifact weapon and Basher-compatible, works surprisingly well with a high weapon skill, though.&lt;br /&gt;There are two-handed weapons out there so powerful you might even consider sacrificing the shield. Purifier, one of your crowning gifts, may be such a one. It slays demons and undead, making it very useful against many opponents you will meet, but you should keep Big Punch because it deals higher damage than Purifier against the enemies it doesn't slay while being one-handed. The rune-covered trident, a two-handed polearm you will be rewarded with if you tell Blup where his mommy is, slays demons and undead as well, has high damage dealing capacities as well as polearm DV and good intrinsics, and especially if you're born in Raven is worth a look. Even for non-Ravens it's definitely not a bad idea to just use spear/shield until level 36 is reached, then switch to the newly arrived rune-covered trident and waste demons and undead with it. A randomly found eternium two-handed sword of penetration or devastation is also definitely worth a try - many dream of finding such a gem.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for the most part, this can be summarized as follows: Wear the best damn shield you can find, and either concentrate on damage or having the best spear - unless you find a really, really kickass two-handed weapon.&lt;br /&gt;There's one thing you should be careful of: Cursed melee weapons. These have several severe disadvantages. Firstly, they only deal half damage to undead and demons. Secondly, you can't unequip them, which means you can't unequip gauntlets, which in turn means you can't unequip rings. That's four slots of equipment blocked off from change right there. It gets real bad if your melee weapon gets rusted, broken or corroded, however. In the worst case, you might get stuck essentially unable to do any significant damage in melee, having to resort to kicking! If that happens, it might be best to look for a way of removing the curse as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Missile weapons&lt;br /&gt;Missile weapons are there to fill the very few gaps your spells or melee weapons leave open... at least that's one way of looking at it. The approach I've adopted early in my ADOM career, which I've never strayed from ever since, is to pick up every bundle of arrows and quarrels I can find, and regularly use bows and crossbows to become trained in both. The reason for that is slaying ammo. Bows and crossbows have the greatest amount of slaying ammunition availabe for them period. Supported by a decent weapon skill, the right slaying ammo oftentimes turns out to be one of the, if not the most efficient way to deal with many of the most powerful opponents - even more efficient than almost any spell that is not Rain of Sorrow. The presence of a bundle of 10 arrows of humanoid slaying and a sufficient weapon skill and a bow can make the difference between life and death if you venture into areas you aren't quite ready for. I can only implore you: Do not miss out on the power of the bow and crossbow. The other missile weapon classes you can easily do without - they have their merits and with high weapon skills can also do loads of damage, but ultimately bows and crossbows are the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;About using missile weapons: Their obvious advantage is that you can use them at a distance. Usually, there are no opponents next to you when you shoot a missile, and very few shoot missiles themselves. You can really improve on your success using missile attacks by switching to berserk every time you fire, but can't be hit by anyone, or at least anyone noteworthy. Extra to-hit, extra damage, quicker demise to your foe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Armor&lt;br /&gt;Well, this should be obvious. Wear the goddamn best armor you can get your hands on. If you think it's worth it (it probably is), use Smithing to make your armor awemor, as in "awesome armor" (Yesss, groaaaaan at the hideous pun, har har har).&lt;br /&gt;What is the best armor? Well, that's the more difficult question. There are two armor ratings: DV and PV. DV influences how easy you are to hit; the higher, the less you will be hit. PV, on the other hand, does not help you getting hit less, but it lessens the damage you take if you are hit. In the early game, you have low HP scores and rather low healing capabalities, and you most probably lack means of effective healing. This means getting hurt frequently will endanger your life over time. To avoid that, PV is very important. Early on, monsters deal relatively low damage, and PV reduces that damage significantly. A PV of zero in the early game necessitates very careful play. A PV of three or four, which most Druids start out with, is okay. PV of five is the threshold where I consider myself rather safe in the upper levels of the early game dungeons. A PV of 10 is pretty safe, and should be more than enough to complete the Yrrigs quest successfully. A PV of 12 or 13 is what I want to have at least before I enter the Caverns of Chaos dungeon. A PV of 15 keeps you alive till Dwarftown and probably further along. A PV of 20 is where you can consider yourself reasonably protected for the midgame. From then on, PV slowly starts to become less important - Monsters tend to overcome that value seldomly, but those who do overcome it tend to have the capability to deal critical hits. Critical hits deal double damage, which means the higher the base damage of the monster, the more dangerous their critical hits become, because the extra damage granted by the critical gets greater. A PV of 4 in the early game had no trouble absorbing a rat critical hit of four damage instead of 2, but with PV 25, a monster with 30 base damage will deal hefty 35 damage to you with a critical. Add the fact that many dangerous monsters also have multiple attacks, corrupting or poisonous hits, and you might notice that not getting hit would be preferable to having your armor absorb only half the damage in total. That's where your DV comes in. With high DV, you are hit much less often, and you are much more able to tolerate the few criticals you have to sustain since you will get the chance to heal up again.&lt;br /&gt;Most armor parts primarily grant PV. Body armor tends to sacrifice DV for PV. In the beginning of the game, a few points of DV are worth sacrificing if it means having more PV. Later on, that's not going to be as true anymore. Thankfully, higher metal body armor comes with higher PV *and* lower DV penalties.&lt;br /&gt;Very important for your DV, as probably has been mentioned before, is the shield. Not only do shields have pretty high DV rates, topping at 20 for the artifact shield Protector, with 16 being the value of a very well-made eternium or crystal tower shield, the shield weapon skill grants additional DV for consistent training, two per level! Your ability to train the shield skill is dependant on your shield DV value, by the way; for every point of DV on the shield, you can train one level in the shield skill. A small shield [+2, +0] will let you train your shield skill to level 2, while a shield with 15 DV is needed if you are to reach Grand Mastery eventually. Being a grandmaster doesn't offer special perks, though, aside from the ludicrous DV bonus. Note that even if your shield skill is higher than two, you can still only get four extra DV if you wear only the aforementioned small shield - yes, even if you are a grandmaster!&lt;br /&gt;An interesting path to take is the wearing of two shields. This can be worth it if you have collected enough spell knowledge to last you through the game, and if you keep some missile weapons in your backhand should you run out of PP. You should, however, remember that you will only get the shield skill bonus once if you wear two shields, which means that the second, the one with the lower DV, will only add that DV and its PV to your armor ratings. The best second shield you can wear, even if your primary shield is Protector, is the aforementioned exceptionally well made 16 DV eternium or crystal tower shield. This is equal to the DV bonus level 12 of the polearm weapon skill would get you, meaning that level 13 in polearms is better than any kind of second shield (except maybe a very persistingly smithed eternium tower shield). Level 11 of the polearm weapon skill gives 14 DV, which is more than even a normal eternium or crystal tower shield would get you. True, polearms do not offer PV, but it's worth remembering that the highest DV values are achieved by being exceptionally skilled in polearms while wearing a spear and an excellent shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The best of the best&lt;br /&gt;There is an awful lot of equipment, magical or not, in the game. Some of it is crap, some of it is harmful, some of it is useful, and some of it is absolutely awesome. I will tell you about some things to look for in the game, and give you information for each slot how you should proceed in the game to improve it.&lt;br /&gt;One thing you should always keep in mind is the fact that everything you find can be either blessed, uncursed or cursed. Cursed equipment, as you probably have already found out, cannot be directly or willfully unequipped. That means that you should handle things you don't know the status of with great care. The general rule is: Only equip items if you consider the potential benefit (Never wear anything of unknown status if the probability that it is better than what you had is very low) worth the risk of it being cursed, and remove the risk of it being cursed by determining whether it is beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;You can find out the status of an item in several ways. The most simple one is dropping the item, or several items, on an altar of your alignment. The second most simple one is reading a blessed scroll of identify - it will not only identify all your items, be they equipped or not, but also reveal the status of all these items. Apart from these two methods, you can only do two things: Learn Detect Item Status, be it from a potion or scroll of education or through a wish (not recommended), or ensure that an item has a certain status by dipping it in holy or unholy water, or reading a scroll of uncursing over it. Remember that after reading a blessed scroll of uncursing, all the items you wore at the time of reading are guaranteed to be non-cursed.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, that leaves the auto-cursing (autos, aute, auton = greek for "self") items inside the equation... There's a limited amount of these, and I will be careful to warn you of them.&lt;br /&gt;I will not mention any of the artifacts that contain the essence of chaos and corruption, simply because while they can be very powerful, the fact that merely carrying them corrupts you makes them highly undesirable in my eyes. If you're willing to take the corruption, they are usually among the best choices available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Rings&lt;br /&gt;There is a wide assortment of rings to choose from, and you would do well to keep a collection of rings in your pack so you can change the ones you wear according to the situation at hand. Arguably the best two rings in the game are artifact rings: The Ring of the Master Cat and the Ring of Immunity. The former grants exceptional dexterity, armor and speed boni along with very useful intrinsics, the latter makes you immune to all elements. There are cases where you might ditch the Ring of Immunity for something else because you already have all or most of the immunities or sufficient resistance, though. In any case, your choice of rings depends on your playing style. Rings of slaying are a prime choice if you plan on using melee or missile weapons and don't mind giving them some extra punch. Rings of regeneration are excellent tools for your average dungeon crawl, since they heal you up wonderfully while you go looking for more trouble. Rings of mental stability serve a double purpose: Granting confusion resistance against some opponents, and increasing your Learning score for reading books. You can consider yourself very lucky if you find a ring of mental stability with a Learning score of +4. Rings of speed are nice, obviously, for the five extra speed and the armor bonus. The Ring of the High Kings, despite being critical (or at least very, very helpful) to passing the eternal guardian, grant resistance to every one of the four elements, and can be considered a "light" version of the ring of immunity that is much more readily available. Lacking it, you can fall back to rings of (element) resistance in case you meet a vortex of the corresponding type. Rings of teleport control are useful if you have neither teleport control nor "teleporting" as an intrinsic, and they are useless if you have teleport control - but they are extremely useful, almost critical, in case you have the "teleporting" intrinsic, but not teleport control; a state known as "teleportitis". There are artifacts that grant teleport control, and there is also an amulet of teleport control - but if you have teleportitis, you need to get control, and the ring is one way to achieve that. A ring of invisibility makes you invisible, a rather useful effect especially when fighting masses of monsters, but there are other ways to get it that do not require a ring slot, or an equipment slot at all for that matter. A blessed ring of ice protects your worn equipment from burning most of the time. This can be helpful, even critical in the Tower of Eternal Flames, but as a spellcaster, you do not depend on them as much as, for instance, an archer would, and you might need a ring slot free for the Ring of the High Kings, and another to obtain confusion resistance. As a spellcaster, I certainly wouldn't wish for rings of ice - I'd make do with higher metal equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Other rings you should take a look at are the ring of damage (blessed, and always on the right hand, gives as much bonus to melee damage as the ring of slaying, but none to missile damage), the ring of the clear mind (confusion resistance without Learning bonus), the ring of searching (okay as a dungeon crawling tool in combination with a very high Detect Traps skill) and the ring of see invisible (the only item besides certain artifacts, including one that is rather easy to get, that grants this particular ability) and rings of the fish (one blessed or two of any status grant immunity to drowning damage).&lt;br /&gt;When handling unidentified rings, watch out for rings of the fish (to a lesser extent), for rings of weakness and rings of doom. Rings of the fish autocurse, rings of doom curse you, doom you, actually have high negative DV and PV and autocurse, and rings of weakness autocurse and reduce your strength to 1. The ring of weakness is the most dangerous if accidentally equipped because it will kill you unless you carry pretty few equipment. All of these rings require the use of Remove Curse, holy water, a scroll of uncursing or divine help to get rid of. This is not to say they are useless - rings of the fish have already been mentioned, being doomed attracts more monsters to kill or sacrifice, and rings of weakness actually help you get stronger, because while you are wearing one, your current strength stays very low, even if your unmodified strength increases. This means that you can use giant corpses, which can be farmed in the wilderness and work very well for weak characters even if their weakness is only magically induced, to continually increase your strength - until it reaches 99, if you like. Then you can unequip the ring of weakness and suddenly you're Heracles. If you like it especially cheap, you can then drink a potion of exchange so you can train on strength even more, rinse and repeat, until all stats are at 99. Congratulations, you've broken the game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Amulets&lt;br /&gt;This has to come right after the rings section because it bears similarities to it.&lt;br /&gt;The most useful, and potentially crucially important, amulets are the amulet of free action, the amulet of death ray resistance, the amulet of petrification resistance and, to some extent, the amulet of life saving. The former three because they are the only items safe for some artifacts (and for death rays, apparently the bracers of resistance) that grant the rare to obtain resistances to paralyzation, death rays and petrification, all very deadly effects. You can be lucky and survive being paralyzed, but both death rays and petrification gas are lethal if they hit you. Petrification might be perceived less important than the other two because the only monster that can petrify you - the gorgon - appears very rarely and its breath hits you very rarely if you have decent DV, yet I ask of you: Would you really want to risk the chance - even if it is 1 to 1000 - of an instadeath every time you meet one? You need an amulet of petrification resistance at least for your pack, right next to your amulet of free action, to be equipped when fighting against the more numerous paralyzing monsters, and the amulet of death ray resistance, to be equipped against powerful spellcasters wielding the mighty Death Ray spell.&lt;br /&gt;So much for the resistance trio. The amulet of life saving really has the effect it advertises with its name (except if it is cursed - it does revive you, but with only 1 HP left, which will seldom be enough to really save your life), not only on you, but also on certain dying sages. Of course, a normal RPG player would never waste his powerful amulet of life saving on some creepy old dude lying about blocking an entire stairway with his frail stature. That's why the Creator just gave him six of the most powerful and desirable scroll ever, the scroll of chaos resistance, only to be given to you if you save his life (apparently, if you don't save him, he doesn't give you the scrolls just to be a jerk). "Okay", you might think, "but getting one's life saved has got to be better than getting any number or kind of scroll, right?" Well, no. To gain the benefit of an amulet of life saving, it has to be worn. Not only does it occupy that slot all the time, it can be destroyed far more easily than you'd feel comfortable with. And it doesn't save you from all kinds of death - for instance, not from being turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos. And even if your blessed amulet of life-saving revives you with full health, it places you right where you've been a second before, getting killed.&lt;br /&gt;It must be pointed out that there is an amulet towering above the first four. I leave it out of all these considerations because it pwns the other artifacts so hard it's not even funny, and because it is a rare to find artifact: Preserver. It grants paralyzation and poison resistance, grants luck, adds 4 PV and DV, seven points of willpower and REGENERATION. You might have to ditch it in rare occasions for the amulet of death ray resistance, but for all purposes, this is the subject of your wet amulet dreams.&lt;br /&gt;Another item worthy of consideration is the amulet of rapid healing, if it is blessed, because it grants a near equivalent of the regeneration ability of Preserver, and the amulet of teleport control for the same reasons as the ring mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the amulets do not have rather impressive effects. The black torc has some neat properties, but they are not worth being cursed (as in bad luck, not cursing of item) by it. The ankh increases your luck, makes you lucky and Fate smile upon you, but is otherwise weak. The Aylas Holy Scarf has excellent armor boni, but is exceptionally rare. The amulet of light deserves a special mention because it is very useful against enemies that use Darkness as part of their strategy. The amulet of order is a useful tool to manipulate your alignment to the lawful direction, giving you full control over it if you have enough patience (to modify your alignment in the other direction, simply lure innocent townsfolk out of Terinyo and brutally murder them in some lonely forest, or just go kill some beggars in the outlaw village). All the other amulets offer some benefit as well you might find superior to the ones above.&lt;br /&gt;When handling unidentified rings, you should be aware of the existence of the amulet of hunger, an autocursing amulet that increases your food consumption; if you can't get rid of it and are short on food, this might spell your doom. Also keep in mind that the useful amulet of light is always a glass amulet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Helmets&lt;br /&gt;There are helmets made of any of the standard four metals and a couple of "special" helmets with special effects. Generally, you should simply wear the helmet with the highest armor rating. The magical effects are few and far between, but can help a lot in the right situations. The helm of mental stability adds Learning stat points (four at the most) and confusion resistance - it's basically a ring of mental stability you can wear on the head. Since it grants confusion resistance just like the ring, it's very useful against enemies using confusion, because confusion resistance can stack, and the more slots you have it available for the better. The helm of water breathing will make every body of water completely harmless if worn. The helmet of teleportation will make you randomly teleport -  it is the only magical item that can do that (apart from an artifact cloak you are extremely unlikely, as in literally one in a billion, to get as a Druid), and you can unequip it if you want to read books, making it infinitely preferable to having the intrinsic naturally or through a corruption. The helm of leadership is mainly useless, as is the diadem of beauty, but you can at least wear them when shopping to increase the respective shopping attribute. The artifact crown of leadership has nice armor, but the extra Charisma is not an issue. In the end, the best choice for headgear is probably one of the various crowns. There are three that grant immunities to the elements of fire, ice and lightning, respectively, and there is one that grants the awesome regeneration attribute. If you find they lack armor value, invest some time in smithing sessions - the helm of mental stability can't be smithed, though. An eternium cap is still a good choice, even unsmithed.&lt;br /&gt;Artifact helms you may find include the crown of leadership, yielding an enormous, but in the end useless, boost to charisma, and granting an okay DV and PV for the endgame, and the crown of science, which gives a very nice Learning bonus. Because it dooms and autocurses, use it sparingly - I find it useful when I want to read books, or shortly before leveling up in case I need more skill advances, but I don't use it for the Tower of Eternal Flames because of the dooming.&lt;br /&gt;When handling unidentified helmets, simply keep in mind that any helmet may be cursed. In the early game, still wear any kind of helmet that will give you extra PV (anything but hoods, hats, silver helmets, iron crowns or leather caps), because that's what's important early on. Even if the thing is cursed, you have the extra PV, helping you survive at least until you can uncurse the helmet and exchange it for a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Body armor&lt;br /&gt;Let's begin with the available artifacts. There are two that can be randomly found, one of which you can also be crowned with, making it worth a closer look. Nature's Companion offers okay, but not overwhelming armor stats, but has several powerful effects: Two elemental immunities, the valuable fire immunity and shock immunity, which is nice until level 40, obsolete after that, as well as fifteen points of extra speed. This is an excellent armor, to be sure, and in my opinion, there is only one artifact armor that can compete with it: The robes of resistance. Instead of two immunities, it grants three resistances, to fire, shock and acid, but it has better armor ratings and grants a toughness bonus. Personally, I'd say the three resistances aren't much worse than the immunities, but 15 speed is better than the extra PV and toughness offered by the robes, so I'd go with Nature's Companion in any case.&lt;br /&gt;Should neither of these two become available to you, there is still the ancient mummy wrapping, the artifact armor you can obtain by killing Rehetep. Its main appeal is the assortment of useful intrinsics, including see invisible and death ray resistance as well as immunity to ice attacks. Its armor rating is pretty mediocre, however, so while you should always keep it in your pack in case you need one of its magical effects, it shouldn't be your main armor for the rest of the game.&lt;br /&gt;The wet dream of every seeker of good armor is to get the magical suffix "of life" on a halfway decent armor. An additional 20% of HP is enormous. Failing that, the armor of choice usually is either an eternium plate mail or one of the four kinds of dragon scale mail. An early found red one will help a lot in the Tower of Eternal Flames.&lt;br /&gt;Until you get there, you will of course go through various suits of armor, with the tendency going towards steady improvement. Starting from your leather armor with usually 2 PV, you will probably soon upgrade to studded leather, and then maybe find chain mail, after that mails of higher metals, and then the ancient mummy wrapping. If you have high effectivity Lightning Bolt(optional), not too shabby HP, some means of item detection or map revealing, and the teleport spell, you can risk a visit to Darkforge, taking a look at the suits of armor stashed there in one of the treasure rooms. More often than not, you will find your first dragon scale mail there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Girdles&lt;br /&gt;The best girdle in the game is the platinum girdle True Strength. Now that you've heard of it, you might as well forget it, as it is near impossible to obtain. You must enter D:50, crowned lawful, without ever having committed a chaotic act, regardless of how minor. Only then will you be granted this most badass girdle evar (and it kills you if you have committed a chaotic act if you wear it).&lt;br /&gt;Now let's get serious, because there is no way in hell you will get this girdle, unless you are such a badass player that you don't need to read this guide anyway. The best girdle you can actually get is the girdle of giant strength, because it adds twelve or more points of strength. A buttload of extra damage, a buttload of extra carrying capacity - both are tremendously useful. If you can't get the girdle of giant strength, or you prefer to wear fireproof items that still assist you in battle, go for an eternium girdle, or any kind of the metal girdles, which are excellent pieces of armor to use Smithing with.&lt;br /&gt;The girdle of carrying, in its blessed state, is also very useful especially found early to alleviate the problems with carrying capacity you will usually encounter. The girdle of greed, in its blessed state, will be of tremendous usefulness in the casino, to carry your obscene amounts of golds so you can buy items with them in the gift shoppe. It can be abused in connection with the Porter talents and billions of gold to increase your carrying capacity far beyond anything you could muster even with 99 strength. All the carrying capacity-increasing girdles, including the girdle of giant strength, have one prime weakness: They can be easily destroyed, or in the case of the girdles of carrying and greed, cursed by hags, making you die a death of being crushed by tons of luggage. I usually refuse to rely on the latter two for this reason, and I even am careful with girdles of giant strength so having one destroyed won't kill me. Most of the times, I stick with one of the metal girdles, which can be smithed up to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;Handle unidentified girdles, especially the magical ones, with great care. A cursed girdle of weight is annoying as hell, a cursed girdle of carrying can be deadly! On top of that, all cursed girdles will make it impossible to change your body armor, so don't even try to equip unidentified leather girdles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Gauntlets&lt;br /&gt;Ironfist, if found, are probably the best choice: Indestructible gauntlets granting quasi-permanent seven extra points of strength! Apart from that, the elemental gauntlets are very useful for their resistances, and because they are an artifact as well. Being an artifact is a good property for gauntlets because not only the gauntlets themselves are protected from destruction this way, the rings under it cannot be destroyed by anything but the wrath of a deity. The only things I'd prefer to the elemental gauntlets unmsmithed are gauntlets of strength with an especially high strength bonus, or extremely obscene gloves of smiting. Smithed gauntlets (gauntlets of strength, normal gauntlets and dragon-hide gauntlets can be smithed) can of be course be so much more powerful than the elemental gauntlets that the resistances the latter offer pale in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Be on the lookout for gauntlets of peace, autocursing gauntlets that heavily penalize your melee and missile to-hit, in exchange for 3 DV and PV. They autocurse, are indistinguishable from normal gauntlets unidentified, and their bonus is generally not worth it. Cursed gauntlets also make you unable to equip or unequip rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Bracers&lt;br /&gt;The best bracers are the bracers of war, bar none. Lacking those, you have to make do with what you can get, of course. The best bracers, at least in my opinion, are the bracers of regeneration, which do exactly what they say they do. The next best bracers are probably either the bracers of toughness or the bracers of resistance. The latter are a potential source of death ray resistance, leaving your amulet slot free to include some of the better amulets against enemies using death rays. Bracers of speed offer a minor bonus, but are probably still superiour to bracers of protection or defense (in the early game, the bracers of protection might be a bit better). All bracers except brass bracers, bracers of toughness and the bracers of war can be smithed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Boots&lt;br /&gt;Blessed seven league boots halve your movement speed, enabling you to outrun almost anything except quicklings, and are extremely valuable assets in the game of strategy that is ADOM. Use scrolls of defense and protection on them. You can do that by equipping only the boots to make sure they are affected instead of other pieces of armor (Just ignore how ridiculous you must look to the passers-by). If you are so much faster than your opponents, you can, provided the space, fire missiles and spells indefinitely without getting hit once. If you don't have the seven leagues, or don't want to wear them for some unfathomable reason, the next best thing are probably boots of speed - unless you are an awesome smith and want to wear [+9, +9] eternium, adamantium, mithril or iron boots. Be wary of cursed seven league boots - only equip boots weighing 30 stones if you have holy water or at least means of removing the curse. Also, do not equip boots weighing 40 stones without a way of curse removal, because they are bound to be the boots of the slow shuffle, autocursing boots with a 20 speed penalty. They CAN be useful if you want to reduce your speed so you can get more XP, but you don't want to get stuck with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Cloaks&lt;br /&gt;Cloaks of invisibility are useful, but you might prefer the spell because it doesn't increase your food consumption as much. Cloaks of defense or protection are good for all the other cases. Cloaks in general are so easily destroyed that I don't usually pay much attention to them. If you feel like it, you can use scrolls of defense and protection to improve your favorite cloak, but then you're really asking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Tools&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that many of the items that can be worn in the tool slot will give you the benefits of the item. For instance, the chaos orbs can be worn in the tool slot to give you ten extra stat points depending on their type. The most interesting are the water orb and the fire orb. The water orb gives 10 willpower, which is great to help push you over the 32 willpower threshold that increases the AoE of your ball spells. It's also great to help you achieve even higher thresholds, and thus even more enormous ball spells. By the time you have to use it to open up the way to the chaos gate, you should be able to achieve 32 willpower without it. The fire orb gives 10 extra points of strength, which will help you carry a lot more without Lordly Might - you should prepare yourself for having to give it up on D:48, though. In contrast to the other three orbs, these two can be found early enough to really help. The mana orb, which gives ten extra mana (yeah, I love pointing out the obvious - how else would I be able to write this much inane drivel?) is cool as well, but that late in the game you usually have enough PP or means of PP replenishment, and you don't get much opportunity to enjoy the bonus before you have to get rid of the orb anyway on D:48.&lt;br /&gt;Other items that can be worn in the tool slot include Hammerhead, which gives some extra toughness this way (less than the earth orb, though) and is in general an excellent tool. Off the top of my head, I'd say there are no other items that can be worn in the tool slot which give extra boni. But you can wear Whirlwind, the artifact sling you can be crowned with, in the missile weapon slot to get fire resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Crowning gifts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Black Thumb&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves and dwarves, 1 in 6 for everyone else&lt;br /&gt;"heavy cudgel" weighing 50 stones, Clubs and hammers, one-handed&lt;br /&gt;+1 to hit, 5d3+4 damage, -2 DV, +3 Toughness&lt;br /&gt;Slays plants and grants sleep resistance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heavy cudgel Black Thumb is not at all heavy for the purposes of Basher, and is arguably one of the shittiest artifacts in the game. Damage-wise, it is better than the hammers made of adamantium, but loses hard to eternium hammers. And the few magical properties it has do nothing to alleviate that. Three extra toughness is merely okay, but sleep resistance is as good as completely useless, and the ability to slay plants comes to effect so ridiculously rarely you can just as well ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Nature's Companion&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves and dwarves, 1 in 6 for everyone else&lt;br /&gt;"fine leather armor" weighing 120 stones&lt;br /&gt;+2 DV, +8 PV, +15 speed, +2 to hit&lt;br /&gt;Grants immunity to fire and shock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might recognize this armor from my section on body armor above, where I concluded that this is arguably the best artifact body armor you can get. The reasons for that are the exceptional speed bonus and the useful immunities contained within. Unless you find something along the lines of empowered red dragon scale mail of life, you'll love this crowning gift. It can be frustrating to get crowned with one of the immunities it would give anyway, however, and starting from level 40, you will get immunity to shock anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Nature's Friend&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves and dwarves, 1 in 6 for everyone else&lt;br /&gt;"intricate wooden shield" weighing 80 stones&lt;br /&gt;+6 DV, +3 PV&lt;br /&gt;Grants resistance to fire, poison, cold, acid, shock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This artifact sounds okay, except that it fails in the most crucial aspect for a shield: DV rating. 6 is shamefully low compared to the awesome shields you can get even rather early. Shields serve the prime purpose of providing DV support for your Druid, and you need good DV on your shield so the shield skill can get you even more. The rest is decoration. Sure, the resistances are nice to have, but can be gotten through other means easily enough. Depending on how early you do get crowned, you might use this for a while, but I'd ditch it for a shield with 9 or even 8 DV anytime. Keep it in case you want to wear two shields and can use the resistances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Purifier&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves and dwarves, 1 in 6 for everyone else&lt;br /&gt;"rune-covered heavy mace" weighing 200 stones, Maces and flails, two-handed&lt;br /&gt;+5 to hit, 4d5+5 damage, -4 DV, +1 PV, +3 Willpower&lt;br /&gt;Slays undead, constructs and demons, grants luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting artifact because of its slaying powers. Its two-handedness is a weakness, though. Also, against anyone not undead, a construct or a demon it deals less damage than the one-handed mace of destruction, not to mention Big Punch, which can be easily gotten in the last Thrundarr quest! It's also highly inferior to the rune-covered trident, so Raven-born Druids will probably flip it the bird if they get crowned with it. You should really only use this against the opponents it slays, and stick to one-handed maces and flails plus shield against anyone else to train the skill. The willpower bonus and the granted luck are only a minor bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Staff of the Wanderer&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves and dwarves, 1 in 6 for everyone else&lt;br /&gt;weighs 40 stones, Staves, two-handed&lt;br /&gt;+2 to hit, 3d8+2 damage, +6 DV, +3 PV, +6 Toughness&lt;br /&gt;Grants immunity to shock and resistance to fire and sleep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? Staves in general are an unsatisfying weapon class because they are neither powerful nor allow you to wear a shield. It tries, oh it tries to make up for it with its weapon skill bonus to DV, but it utterly fails in that regard because the combination of polearm and shield totally kicks the crap out of it. And so we have the staff of the Wanderer, the typical staff. It's mediocre in damage, it's mediocre in defense, and even the immunity to shock and the extra toughness hardly make up for that. I can't imagine a case where you would ditch a spear and shield for this unless if for roleplaying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Whirlwind&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves and dwarves, 1 in 6 for everyone else&lt;br /&gt;"rune-covered sling" weighing 3 stones, Slings&lt;br /&gt;+12 to hit, +12 to damage&lt;br /&gt;Grants resistance to fire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the less impressive artifacts. If you are well versed in using slings, it will come in handy, because high weapon skill plus Whirlwind will let you do great damage even with simple rocks. However, you're a spellcaster, your weapon skill will not get as great so fast if you're not a hurthling, and you should train for the slaying ammunition you will get for the bow and crossbow instead. For hurthlings, it's still an interesting option because of their bonus in training slings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Sun's Messenger&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for high and gray elves&lt;br /&gt;"elven long bow" weighing 30 stones, Bows&lt;br /&gt;+15 to hit, +15 to damage&lt;br /&gt;Slays undead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent crowning gift. With this and halfway decent weapon skill, you can lay waste on powerful undead, and with the right slaying ammo you can devastate all enemies in the game. The damage bonus is unrivalled by any bow that is not an artifact. High and gray elves should train in bows under any circumstance just in case they luck out and get crowned with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Hammerhead&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 for dwarves&lt;br /&gt;"pick axe" weighing 90 stones, Axes, one-handed&lt;br /&gt;+2 to hit, 2d10+4 damage, +2 DV, +2 PV, +3 Toughness&lt;br /&gt;Grants resistance to fire and stunning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a melee weapon, this is okay, better than an eternium battle axe even, but it doesn't provide the ludicrous armor boni of the polearm weapon class, for instance, and all in all is simply not something to get excited about. It really shines in its use as a tool, because it is indestructible, enabling you to mine as much as you want without worrying about replacing or repairing your pickaxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Things to wish for&lt;br /&gt;Well, I already mentioned a lot of very desirable items to have, but here are the items I generally consider if I find myself in the lucky situation of actually having a wish to spare. In general, you should keep in mind that you are rarely restricted to wish for single items. Instead, always wish for them in plural. You might end up with four incarnations of the item you desired! If I use the singular in the following phrases, that means that you will only get one item no matter what because it's considered too powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "amulet of life saving", the item with which you can save Khelavaster and receive six scrolls of chaos resistance as a reward&lt;br /&gt;- "scrolls of chaos resistance", which gets you usually three&lt;br /&gt;- "pairs of seven league boots", which give you excellent mobility, the extra boots should be kept as spares - you'll probably need them&lt;br /&gt;- "girdle of giant strength", for its unrivalled strength bonus, but can be destroyed rather easily&lt;br /&gt;- "spellbooks of Rain of Sorrow", because it is the most powerful spell you can get and several books will last you through all the dangerous enemies plus excessive practice&lt;br /&gt;- "[color of choice] dragon scale mails", to get excellent armor plus an immunity of your choice&lt;br /&gt;- "Find Weakness", to get a useful melee fighting skill&lt;br /&gt;- "Alchemy", if you can train it to 100 and check out the recipe for potions of gain attributes&lt;br /&gt;- "wands of destruction", to make D:50 easier&lt;br /&gt;- "potions of quickling blood", yummy yummy speed&lt;br /&gt;- "potions of youth", if you play a race with a short lifespan and don't want to rely on Alchemy to give you a workable recipe&lt;br /&gt;- "scrolls of education", to get some random extra skills&lt;br /&gt;- "magical writing sets", if you have already seen scrolls of education and really want to get as many skills as possible, plus you might succeed in scribing a scroll of chaos resistance with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, if you are aiming for an ultra ending, you might have to wish for some of the rare items you need to collect. But if that were the case, you wouldn't need to read some shitty guide aimed at semi-beginners, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V. Monster Bash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The early times: Monsters to watch out for&lt;br /&gt;Well, the usual suspects? There are some early game monsters that always pose a danger, regardless of the class you play. Mimics are certainly among them. They can paralyze you for a long time, usually enough for them or other monsters nearby to kill you unless you are well armored. Ghuls have the same ability, but it kicks in rather rarely since they have to successfully hurt you and with halfway decent PV that doesn't happen often. Still, don't let yourself get surrounded by ghuls. When trapped by a necromancer early on, it's important for your chance of survival that you kill the ghuls first if possible, and let yourself be surrounded by zombies and skeletons instead. Also, be careful when fighting floating eyes and gelatinous cubes. They can paralyze you if you hit or kill them with a melee weapon or in unarmed combat. You should use a missile weapon or (if missile weapon not present) a spell to kill them, especially if there are other monsters nearby. Be extremely careful of "Hurumph!"s and Dorn Beasts, as attacking them even once paralyzes you for such a long time you can usually only watch your character get mauled. Fuck paralyzation. (Love it when it's in a wand and you can shoot people with it, though!)&lt;br /&gt;Other monsters that are a pain in the ass... Gray oozes and ochre jellys are pretty hard for a very early game PC, and they corrode your melee weapon, making them prime targets for your Divine Wrath spell. Spiders and other poisonous monsters (though spiders will only be hostile if summoned - which will happen a lot) are dangerous until you manage to get a spider (any'll do) corpse or giant centipede corpse. Eat it to get poison resistance, probably the most important early game resistance if you want to survive. Of course, the Slow Poison or Neutralize Poison spells also help a lot in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;Some monsters, for instance corpse fiends or rats, may make you sick upon touch. If that happens, don't panic. First think. Do you have some means of Curing Disease? Like, for example, a spell of that name? No? Um, ever found herbs? Perchance, some curaria mancox, because these just happen to be helpful in such an unfortunate case? No? Well... You did choose the Yrrigs quest, right? So you could try to stumble and crawl your way through the dungeons so you can let yourself be healed by Jharod? No? And you're sure you can't find some herbs in time? The Unremarkable Dungeon below the Small Cave or the Big Room in the Caverns of Chaos could be a possibility... No? Um, maybe you have some sort of healing potion in your pack? Tried to drink it? Did it work? No? Hm. Tried praying to your gods? You did, and the ground keeps rumbling without it ever working even once? Okay... Well, at least you have the healing skill and somewhat okay HP, so you will be able to outlive the sickness, right? Unless some of the more dangerous monsters catch you, that is... Best of luck, this or next time!&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous monsters that may catch you by surprise early on include vortices and ogre magi. Vortices are the capital Vs floating about in dungeon levels whose only means of attack is to explode. Needless to say, that explosion does damage. Lots of it. Vortices exist in the four main elements of the game. Fire vortices are the first ones to appear usually. They deal about 40 to 50 points of fire damage (I'm calculating from memory, so don't rely on the numbers, though recent estimations seem to indicate I'm erring on the side of caution. Beware of experienced vortices, however, because they can deal quite a pile of more damage - the issue of how vortices can even BECOME experienced is one for another time), usually killing most PCs with low to medium hitpoints. Trolls that have reached level four or five are on the safe side. Any PC that has managed to obtain a source of fire resistance will be able to take the attack, too. But what to do if you have neither the HP or the resistance to survive a fire vortex? Destroy it! The best solution for that: Use a frost bolt on it. Frost Bolts are provided by the Nether Bolt spell or by a wand of cold. Fire vortices don't have a lot of hit points and are vulnerable to ice, meaning one hit with a frost bolt will destroy them without them going off. The same method can be employed against ice vortices, only you require some sort of fire spell. Hellish Flames (Fire Bolt) is pretty common. If you're feeling especially adventurous, Baptism of Fire works too, but you better be sure it does the trick (It will - in about 99% of the cases)! If you don't have spells that counter the vortices' element, any other spell works too, but you'll probably have to hit them successfully two or three times. If you notice the vortex early enough, that's fine. Note that lightning and acid vortices, which appear a lot later and are also a lot more dangerous damage-wise, cannot be as easily dispatched because they have no elemental weakness; prepare to use several bolt spells on them, and try to be resistant to those elements! If you meet a vortex, lack the resistance or HP to survive it and any spell to defeat it in time, cast Darkness. If you don't have Darkness, or any kind of darkness source, switch to berserk, shoot missiles at it until it is next to you, then hit him with your melee attack (or your missile attack, whichever is more damaging) and hope for the best...&lt;br /&gt;Ogre magi sport a combination which can be outright deadly for an early game PC: Invisibility and frost bolt spells. Ogre magi will usually cast invisibility instantly, meaning you may not notice them until they start hitting you with frost bolts. The frost bolts will hit you for about 15 damage if you aren't resistant to cold, meaning one won't kill you, but three or four of them, depending on your HP count, could. The trouble is making them stop, because you have to find them first. If you don't have the ability to see invisible, you will have to guess where they are. Be grateful to whatever god you worship if you encounter an ogre magus in a hallway, because that makes hitting the bastard easy. If you're in a room, it gets infinitely more difficult. The only clue you have are the frost bolts. Check carefully from where they come, and approach that place. Once you're certain you can land a hit on the ogre magus, go all-out berserk and hit him with anything you've got. Since ogre magi are ogres, they aren't pushovers in melee, so you need to show them no mercy! Alternatively, if you noticed the frost bolt flew a straight line before hitting you, you can reverse the roles by shooting off a bolt spell yourself! Just be careful of bouncing spells like Divine Wrath. You don't want them to bounce straight back and hit you. You do want them to bounce back and hit the ogre magus twice without hitting you, if that's possible.&lt;br /&gt;Dark sages are in the same category as ogre magi because of their pretty dangerous shock spell attack, and they arrive a lot earlier. Don't waste time running up to them if you can help it - blast the motherfucker with your spells before he does the same to you!&lt;br /&gt;Let's see, what more advice is there to give... Bah, you'll figure out most of the stuff yourself. In the end, you must figure out a lot yourself. Be careful of monsters that corrupt you or drain your stats. Be careful of monsters with special attacks, like Dorn Beasts (near permanent paralysis unless wearing a source of paralyzation resistance if you attack them in melee) or gorgons (whose breath can turn you to stone unless you have a source of petrification resistance! Always switch to coward mode around these, as DV seems to increase your chance to evade the petrification breath!). Remember that orb guardians and other special enemies tend to be more on the "dangerous" side of the spectrum. Remember that if all else fails, you can always try to run away, or ask people on the ADOM forum for help (if your pride allows you to do that, of course!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Denying monsters a fair fight: Special Strategies, Or: Cheap Little Tricks (tm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Lurking within the dark, the brave hero strikes the unsuspecting foe from behind...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkness spell is one that I tend to under-use, though I hope that I have ceased to underestimate it. (You should take solace in the thought that even I regularly fail to follow quite some of the hints I've given, and despite that managed to win this game ten times as of today.) As has been mentioned in the skill description for it, there are many opponents that are unable to fight in the dark. The best teacher for the correct use of the Darkness spell, at least if you want to stay on ADOM Guides, is gut. In his Wizard's Guide you will be able to read closer instructions on using the spell to your advantage. Darkness works extra awesomely once you have the Backstabbing skill, so much is obvious. Remember the minstrel's song? "Brave Sir Robin backstabbed him, bravely bravely backstabbed him... When it looked like he would lose the fight, he valiantly turned off the light, when danger showed its ugly neck, he bravely stabbed it in the back... Bravely bravely, bravely bravely, bravely bravely, bravely brave, bravely bravely braaaaave Sir Robin..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Woe is me, for I have been stripped of my eyesight! Oh woe oh woe oh woe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potion of blindness can turn the tide of the most crucial battles in the game. Regardless of how vicious your foe is, how much he is positively brimming of arcane power, or rocks the earth with every step of his towering clawed hooves, absolutely no one in ADOM is immune to the awesome power of this little flask. All you have to do is throw it in the face of your enemy. He will then start crying like a little girl, screaming "Not the face, not the face", and will be unable to do anything but stagger and flail aimlessly at anything nearby. This is an excellent method to incapacitate any enemies that cast spells or use any kind of annoying special attacks. I can't spell out in words how tremendously valuable this effect is against the likes of Nuurag-Vaarn or the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. It does make them a little bit tricky to aim at with bolt spells, but you can't have everything, eh?&lt;br /&gt;Note that a cursed potion of invisibility has the same effect as a potion of blindness, even if you throw it! You can find them randomly or use unholy water to produce one, if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Who am I again, and what's up with those two strange guys wearing the spear and the shield?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potion of confusion is yet another excellent tool, on the same level of importance as the potion of blindness... because it has the same effect. Confusing AND blinding an opponent has no effect other than if he stops being blind, he's still confused and the other way around. Might be helpful, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) By all that is unholy and chaotic, where are all these fucking spider webs coming from?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any enemy, regardless of power, is unable to get through spider webs easily. Whether that enemy is a rat or a greater moloch makes no difference in how many turns are wasted going through the web (in fact, the greater moloch is slower, so he will take longer). Making them go through some webs before they can reach you will buy lots of valuable time spent on missile attacks and spells that do not burn webs, like Nether Bolt or Minor Punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Huh... That green ray he keeps shooting at me looks sort of stran-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand of paralyzation is one of the best wands in the game, as it is the only way to paralyze an enemy. Paralyzed enemies are absolutely helpless for as long as they are paralyzed. Especially for enemies that are otherwise dangerous or undesirable to melee, this can be very useful in case you have to actually melee them (as a spellcaster, you might think you shouldn't have to resort to that usually, but for the purposes of special monster strategy, ball spells ARE melee). The awesomeness of this strategy is somewhat diminished by the fact that the paralyzation ray can be shrugged off rather easily. Still, no enemy shrugs off bolts all the time, and all you have to do to use the wand effectively is to put yourself in a position where you can waste a couple of turns trying to hit your enemy successfully with it. Since the bolt is not stopped by other monsters inbetween you and the enemy to be paralyzed, this is easy to do - you can use your druid class power to create an animal meat shield, or a scroll of familiar summoning, or the Summon Monsters spell, or a wand of monster creation, or any kind of figurine, or simply one of the already existing enemies, cunningly lured in front of you, flailing at you with a laughable attack while blocking up the way for the dangerous monstrosity patiently waiting for its turn (monsters can be so DUMB in ADOM). Once you succeed at paralyzing your monster of choice, simply get rid of the meat shield and start smacking the helpless foe with your awesome melee weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Ugh... I don't feel so good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your enemies, just like you, don't react well to poison and sickness. The good news is, there are means to afflict them with both. To sicken an enemy, throw a potion of sickness at him (what, you didn't think you were supposed to drink it, did you?). Reportedly, that lowers his max HP, so it's best to do that in the beginning of a fight. To poison him, you can either throw a potion of poison, zap a wand of poison (the poison ray can be shrugged off, though), or hurt him with a weapon or missile that is poisoned, either thanks to being the emerald dagger Serpent's Bite, having the magical prefix "poisonous", being wielded by someone with the poisoned hands corruption, or having been dipped in a potion of poison. Poison will slowly whittle away at the HP of your enemy. If you poison him enough, it will help tremendously in killing him, leading to the satisfying phenomenon of "off-screen XP" that tells you you succeeded even as your opponent employed the old run away tactic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A section on bosses?&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I was considering leaving this out because what the hell I did this two times already, but I managed to enlist the help of Killmaster, the high elven fighteress, who apparently even slaughtered her own parents for giving her that name. Quite spooky, but she knows her thing. Before you read on - do you really, really, really want to? I mean, isn't it much more satisfying to have figured out the way to kill the most dangerous foes in the game yourself? What? Yeah, I guess you're right, Killmaster... It IS quite a bit more satisfying to not have your character's... ass raped... at the hands of these... motherfucking... bastards. Ahem. Well then, read on, but don't say I didn't warn you! Killmaster, they're all yours...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Yrrigs&lt;br /&gt;What? You're asking me about ways to kill Yrrigs? Have you gone bonkers? First of all, he is easy to kill with any sort of your fancy Druid spellcasting. Second, are you unable to muster the brainpower required to grasp there is some sort of healer and some sort of rather sick person in the same dungeon? Don't you think that maybe it would be a sort of good idea to somehow get these people together instead of just killing one of them off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Keethrax&lt;br /&gt;So, you chose the Keethrax quest. Quite bold of you! The black druid has quite a variety of attacks for an enemy appearing this early. Many dive down to the bottom of the Druid Dungeon to create him, then leave him be until much later in the game. Ha! I say. Pussies, the lot of them. He isn't even that dangerous. Okay, I guess it might not be that bad an idea to be resistant to fire if you want to fight him. He uses those fancy-pants special fire attacks that're so all the rage among liches and skeletal kings. He also casts darkness. Makes him a bit harder to find, but if he's in a hallway, don't give a shit. And he can shoot sling bullets. Ooh, do you see me shaking in my boots? Thought so. And stop checking out my legs, you perverted bastard. Anyway, your wussy Druid magic won't faze him, unless you use Minor Punishment or Acid Bolt. How I know this? Hey, you think you can gather experience enough to reach level 50 of the fighter class and not know all kinds of useless garbage? In any case, be about level 9 when you fight him, and you should have passed the 10 PV threshold just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Hotzenplotz&lt;br /&gt;Well, if you're not poison resistant, you better not mess with this guy mano a mano. Even if you are, count yourself lucky you're one of those spellcasting pussies who can sling spells from afar without letting their opponent reach them, because he is so much more of a pussy he uses extremely potent poisons even resistance won't help much against. His two henchmen are a lot less of a trouble. Just blast them too, for good measure. Important here, aside from the efficient means of dealing distance damage, is at least okay speed. Try to be unburdenened and non-satiated, or have the Quick talents, so you can keep a distance from Hotzenplotz in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Rehetep&lt;br /&gt;Oh gods, that creepy old geezer... Man, did I ever beat the shit out of him. He does not have any special attacks. In fact, he's so much of a wuss I really wonder how so many people apparently got robbed of their skin by him. But like every giant pussy, he has a bunch of henchmen at his side. Just don't let your guard down, and be prepared for everything. Being invisible is something you spellcasting types are good at, so why not? Say what you will about the guy, but he does have a talent for nasty surprises. Not a bad idea to be level 16 or even 17 when you meet him, and have decent equipment. (Editor's note: The wand of fireballs you can get in one of the Thrundarr quests should ideally be gotten before you get to the Pyramid. Mummies are vulnerable to fire.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Griff&lt;br /&gt;Hey, respect for the guy, all I can say. Those rockhuggers built that hugeass tomb just for him, after all! And now that he has been raised from the dead, he continues to beat the living shit out of the living, or the living out of the living shit so only the shit remains - depends on how you want to look at it. Well, you better get pumped and be just as extreme in melee as him. He doesn't have special attacks or something - just good and honest brute force. But since you're not an awesome fighter like me, you can whip out your teleport wand or cast an Ethereal Bridge spell, teleport your cowardly ass behind him and pour holy water on his grave. You still get the XP, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Nonnak&lt;br /&gt;So, you know how the word necromancer begins the same as the word necrophiliac? Think about it. Heh heh. Made you throw up a little there, right? This creepy old dude loves to cast frost bolts. If you are immune thanks to wearing the other creepy old dude's ancient mummy wrapping (let me just say: EWWWW), you can let him do this, grin at him and attack him with missiles or spells or whatever you want. Watch out if he decides to beat you with his walking stick instead - he knows where it hurts. If you've got any kind of muscle and some grasp of melee, however, you should be able to kick his ass into next week (Editor's note: If a level 50 fighter talks about "some grasp of melee", you should know that you need to be pretty good. 40 DV/ 18 PV or something along those lines is a good idea.). Or, you know, use spells like a giant pussy. Might be smart to deduce that if he is immune to any element, it's probably ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Snake from Beyond&lt;br /&gt;Now we're getting where the money is. That fiend is a real pain. Okay, it poisons and corrupts you in melee - bad. It shrugs off spells a lot - worse. It's not immune to fire, so Invoked Devastation is effective, and neither is it to other ball spells except for Freezing Fury, at least I believe so. But without the water orb your willpower is maybe not yet 32, so ball spells would have to be cast in melee range. Not good. There are no slaying arrows compatible with the thing. Remember the cheap little tricks Silfir, that absolute &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;drooling idiot&lt;/span&gt; dream of a man (Editor's note: There, much better!), taught you in the last section, especially the one about webs. You have to be fast to use it to your advantage though - you can only web so many squares as are still between you and the Snake. A wand of paralyzation is excellent here. Something above 20 PV, but most importantly good DV, like above 50 on normal, really helps not to get your ass kicked too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Skeletal King&lt;br /&gt;How that guy managed to lock himself in a lonely room in the middle of a pond full of bloodthirsty chaos piranhas is really beyond me. Anyway, after you've made your bridge to his small chamber, be it made of ice or wood, just let him out and get away from that lake as quickly as possible. Be resistant to fire. If you go into melee, I will respect the fact that you apparently grew some balls (or the equivalent of that in case you're one of the members of the superior gender), but don't think it's going to be easy. He can hit pretty hard and is hard to kill himself. Undead slaying ammo is how the smart guys do it. Spells don't work too well, but I guess Rain of Sorrow will still waste him good enough. Oh, and should he confuse you with his mind tricks (be resistant to confusion to avoid that), just clean your ears. Trust me, it's a lot better than staggering around and taking a little swim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Ancient Chaos Wyrm&lt;br /&gt;Hoo boy. That's going to be exciting. First, reread the section on the awesome little tricks. I called them cheap before, but isn't it a lot more cheap to hide your bastard orb guardian ass at the top of an entire Tower on goddamned FIRE? And to shoot energy bolts that take away 120 HP with one hit and cannot be resisted ALL THE FUCKING TIME? And to try and confuse your enemy ALL THE SAME FUCKING TIME? Potions of blindness, wands of paralyzation and all that - they're self-defense, I say! Nether Bolts and Acid Bolts are pretty effective on him if you have some degree of effectivity, and so are Rain of Sorrow and Freezing Fury. The spells are perfect to use AFTER you got rid of those pesky special attacks with the aforementioned little tricks. It's a good idea to be high on HP, 200 or more, preferably at least 250, when fighting him, so you don't get utterly slaughtered the second it gets a clear shot at you. Why it breathes fire sometimes is completely beyond me - if you're still alive after walking through an entire Tower full of fire, it should be obvious that you're immune or highly resistant. I should mention the bastard is vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo, but unless you're using a blessed ring of ice, that's not going to help you much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Cat Lord&lt;br /&gt;Well, just talk to him and get the awesome ring. What do you mean, he is beating the crap out of you and you can't even see him? You're a Druid, right? What? You managed to kill a cat? AS A DRUID?! Well, then just die. Seriously. If you're this incompetent, I don't want you near any kind of chaos gate. Let the adventurers with some brain cells left handle this.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, okay, so you could do nothing about it and it was an accident. Get up already, and for Corellius' sake, stop slobbering all over my boots. Now, listen up. The bastard is a bit over-sensitive about his beloved cat brethren, but he is one hell of a fighter. I'd not want to fight him with at least some blessed extra healing potions, and that's saying something. He's also invisible usually if he fights, which is easily countered by the appropriate ring or the all-purpose mummy wrapping of the creepy old geezer. Again, little tricks help. Confusion, blindness, especially webbing hallways and paralyzing. Get him on a level that allows teleportation so you have more freedom in setting up your webbed deathtraps. He shrugs off spells and paralyzation like he doesn't even give a shit, but keep trying, it will work eventually. He gets more dangerous the more cats you have killed, but since you only accidentally killed one, that shouldn't be - what? You accidentally killed EIGHTY-THREE? Okay, then damn WELL make sure he doesn't get into melee range unless you have lots of blessed extra healing and emergency teleportation. Or better yet, DIE IN A FIRE. I mean, if you're this stupid, you can't even be sentient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Yulgash&lt;br /&gt;He's a pussy. I mean, a real pussy. His spells only tickle you, and his melee attack doesn't deserve even being called an attack; it's more like spastic movement that appears to hit you. Just go in there, keep the important items out of the electrical item destruction inside the temple, clear out the right outside, open the thing up, and get to him someway. I wouldn't let him survive long, because as much of a pussy he is, he's good at summoning monsters, and sometimes he summons monsters that are not pussies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Ancient Stone Beast&lt;br /&gt;How can an enemy that is essentially nothing but a bunch of rock hit so light? I mean, compared to your powers at this stage in the game, this is the equivalent of what? A goblin slavemaster very early on? Anyway, for all the monsters in that temple one thing's for sure: High PV is a bitch to get through. Unless you have a penetrating weapon or a phase dagger, your best bet is probably spells. Acid works, not sure about the rest. Same's true for the Ancient Stone Beast in any case, only more so, because it has the highest PV and assloads of HP. Rain of Sorrow it, if you can. Fighting it with a non-penetrating weapon takes fucking forever, so try other ways. If you have good missile weapon skills, construct slaying ammunition is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;m) Nuurag-Vaarn&lt;br /&gt;The last of the orb guardians, and the biggest pain in the ass of them all. He casts all sorts of annoying and dangerous spells (including death rays, time to whip out that amulet you've hopefully been saving, or those bracers of resistance, or the Mummy Wrapping of the Creepy Old Geezer). He confuses you just like the wyrm, so confusion resistance is likewise in order. He also casts Darkness, so a torch might be nice. He is surrounded by magebane and magedoom eyes, which I don't care one iota about, but for you it's either no spellcasting or casting spells out of HP until you've taken out the eyes. That can take a whole lot of time because the chaos wizards keep spamming you with chaos creatures once you even set one foot inside the temple. Use every single cheap trick you have at your disposal on the archmage once you reach him (it's more likely he reaches you, though). Blinding or confusing is important so you can go into melee range without getting your stats sucked out of you, and stay out of melee range without getting your ass shock attacked like there is no tomorrow. Kill him with humanoid slaying ammo, an awesome humanoid slaying or otherwise damaging melee weapon, or with Rain of Sorrow, once he is incapacitated. I should mention that despite being the most powerful chaos being this side of the chaos gate, he has a strange mental illness: If faced with a simple door made out of fucking WOOD, all he can do is go "Hurrh durrh durrh" and stand in front of it scratching his head even as you Rain of Sorrow him to death from behind the door, which, in the end, makes him a giant pussy after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n) D:50&lt;br /&gt;The final challenge. This room is chock full of chaos creatures, but the most dangerous ones are probably the balors (trolls and orcs should keep clear of the ghost lords as well, though). The bad thing is, to close the chaos gate permanently, you have get rid of either the balors or the levers once you activated them. With wands of destruction, the latter can be achieved, making the whole endeavour much easier. In any case, the best thing to do is to dig corridors along the upper and lower boundary of the level until you reach the rooms containing the levers. If your way is blocked, you have managed to be the unlucky guy who gets stuck with an undiggable left half of D:50, which can randomly happen in any game. That essentially means nothing except you have to batter and splash your way through the room full of writhing masses of primal chaos before you can reach the lever rooms. That's the point where even I would rather be a spellcaster, what with bolt and ball spells taking them out by the dozens. Being able to on-demand teleport and possessing wands of destruction is the least messy method: Clear both lever rooms, turn a lever, destroy it, teleport the FUCK away to the next lever room, turn the lever, destroy it, teleport to the stairs, go up. Now, that was the pussy method. Real heroes, like me, want to beat the shit out of those balor bastards, and the best way to fight them one after another is to handle both levers, teleport away, hit away the annoying message, teleport back. Kick ass, rinse and repeat. Balor asses are easily kicked with Rain of Sorrow, and I think Freezing Fury might work too. Minor Punishment will work in any case, especially if there are some balors lining up in a hallway. Who says bloodthirsty demons can't be courteous? Okay, they're probably just really, really dumb. Demon-slaying melee weapons are an excellent asset on D:50, because the balors really are pretty much the only really dangerous things on there. Everything I've said about balors is true for Fistanarius, the greater balor, as well. Just be a bit more careful around him, because he hits harder. It might be prudent to minimize the balor-fighting if your corruption status is bad and you've run out of scrolls of chaos resistance. Well, hope that helped. Now, Silfir, you lazy bum, where's the drink you promised me? Hey, where'd he go? Aaaargh... I'm going to fucking rip out his SPINE and stick it up where the sun doesn't shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VI. Closing words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pant, pant, wheeze... Did I lose her? Ahem. Thanks to you for reading what is probably my last guide for quite some time! Thanks and apologies to Killmaster for her invaluable assistance, though in hindsight I should have paid more attention to the prices in that tavern beforehand. I mean, don't these people realize that even one gold coin is actually a fortune for real worlders like me? Sigh. Special thanks go to gut, because after hearing I was working on a Guide to Being a Druid, he sent me the stuff he already had collected for such a guide. Even though I didn't end up quoting any of it, it certainly was food for thought, and some ideas probably found their way into this document after I unscrupulously made them my own. Apart from that, well, thanks go to all the guys, male or female, in the ADOM Hall of Fame forum or the official adom.de forum who somehow influenced what I accomplished, even if I can't tell for the life of me how now. Oh, and thanks to Monty Python, for without their movies I would not have been able to make up that crappy song you may have noticed...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/9119215138464115358/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=9119215138464115358' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/9119215138464115358'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/9119215138464115358'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2008/05/guide-to-being-druid.html' title='Guide to Being a Druid'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3710148354194913408.post-4920866956260269917</id><published>2007-12-09T15:07:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-12-09T20:34:12.896+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='wizard'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='guide'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='contributed'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gut'/><title type='text'>Wizard's guide (by gut)</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gut is a regular poster in the ADOM Hall of Fame Forum, a great place should you have any questions about the game. With his Wizard's guide, playing a wizard is a walk in the park. Well, not exactly a walk. More like a run from a ferocious tiger called RNG... Anyway, reading this will go a long way to help you win the game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(EDIT: Now it shouldn't look as hideous anymore...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(EDIT2: SWEET MERCIFUL JESUS, FORMATING, WORK!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;                                  CONTENTS&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;01.

Limited Walk-through&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  01.  INTRODUCTION&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;A wizard's guide for adom 1.1.1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some questions about writing a guide for wizards. I think the only players that would benefit from a guide, are the very new or unspoiled players. In my opinion, these are the exact players that should *not* play as wizards, but instead try maybe a trollish or drakish healer. At the very least play a character that has a high toughness stat, you will live much longer that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I typing this guide?  Because lot of new players *want* to play as wizard's! If you download a game with dragons, elves, dwarves, quests, and magic, of course you are going to want to go blasting your way through Ancardia with reckless abandon! It's just that, this particular game has a way of killing you, if you do that. Then players get frustrated because they keep croaking so fast, and having to do the same stuff over and over again, without getting any farther in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will focus on using magic effectively, and what kind of tactics to use, to keep your wizard alive longer. I will also mention good places to get books, as they are the main things that will make you powerful as a wizard. I will cover only that which is necessary to win a game. That means I will leave a lot out, I know, but some must be left to the player. If you want to get really spoiled, then read the official guidebook.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  02.  SPELLS&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Before anything else, you must be aware of what spells are available to you, and what is their usefulness to you. Yes, even before race/class considerations, you must know what your arsenal will be. I will write a brief list of the most useful ones. Only the ones that will have a big impact on your survival chances, because a full list (of all the uses of all available spells) would be waaay to long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Offensive]&lt;br /&gt;You will start every game with at least one of these, so know them well. I wanted to include approximate PP cost for each spell, and even for each race, but PP cost fluctuates so much, (based on cycle of the moon along with many other factors) that I have given approximations for all races in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acid Bolt&lt;br /&gt;This is very powerful, and therefore, quite expensive in terms of PP used per casting. It does not cause 'special damage' to any monster, but few monsters are resistant to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;br /&gt;This is powerful, and therefore, a bit expensive in terms of PP used per casting. It does cause 'special damage' to a few monsters, and few monsters are resistant to it. This spell has the ability to bounce off of walls, this means you can attack your enemies in creative ways, even around corners. It also means, you can accidentally kill yourself with it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frost Bolt&lt;br /&gt;This is somewhat powerful and is therefore reasonable in terms of power points. This spell does cause 'special damage' to fire monsters, this is balanced by the fact that more monsters have resistance to it. Frost bolt, when used over a water square, will create an ice bridge, capable of holding 2000 stones of weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fire Bolt&lt;br /&gt;This is also powerful, but not usually expensive in terms of power points. This spell does cause 'special damage' to ice and water monsters, this is balanced by the fact that more monsters have resistance to it. Fire bolt, when used over a corpse has a chance to cook the corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic Missile&lt;br /&gt;All by it's self. It is least powerful of all the bolt spells, also not expensive, usually about 8-10 PP to start out. This spell does not cause 'special damage' to any monsters. This is balanced by two things. First, no items laying on the ground will ever be destroyed by a passing magic missile. All other bolt spells will destroy items on the ground, though I think frost bolt only destroys books and scrolls and potions. Second, *NO* monster in the game is resistant to magic missile. This means that magic missile will be your only damaging bolt spell against a few monsters, so train it. This spell also has the ability to bounce off of walls, this means you can attack your enemies in creative ways (even around corners). It also means, you can accidentally kill yourself with it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ball spells&lt;br /&gt;These are also acid/lightning/fire/ice, and so follow the same damage and cost patterns of their bolt spell equivalents. They have three main advantages over bolt spells. First, if you're surrounded, they can attack all of the monsters surrounding you, bolt spells only attack in a straight line. Second, NO monsters can shrug them off, ever. Third, bolt spells can't go through doors or walls, ball spells can. You have to have a high Willpower stat to increase the radius of your ball spells to take advantage of that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burning Hands&lt;br /&gt;Much like ball spells, though a FEW monsters can shrug it off. It's fire though, so many creatures are resistant to it. You can consider it as a wizard's substitute for melee against most monsters . It will help you save your bolt spells, so it is nice to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Advantage Spells]&lt;br /&gt;We're skinny little wizards, we need all the advantages we can get! These spells tend to even the playing field for wizards, when it comes to combat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkness&lt;br /&gt;One of the best, and most under-used spells in the wizard's arsenal. It gives %100 protection from some of the nastiest monsters in the early (and middle, and late) game. These monsters can not fight in the dark and will stupidly stand in one spot, and happily take punishment from you, until they die, or panic and run away. If a monster panics though, and they have no way to escape you they may then attack you, so be careful when dealing with panicking monsters. Also darkness doesn't work on monsters when they stand in doorways, even if the doorway registers as being in the dark, this may be a bug. Here is a partial list, (I know I will leave some out) of some monsters it can save your life from. Early game: Vortexes, mimics, ogres(lords, magus) and spiders. Middle game: animated trees, Snake from Beyond, berserkers (kings, emperors), Late game: doppleganger kings, titans (greater). For the most part humanoids, giants, and animals won't fight back in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invisibility&lt;br /&gt;Most of the monsters that can or can't see in the dark, behave the same with regard to invisibility, A notable exception is undead monsters (vampires, ghuls, etc...). Unlike darkness, you can not engage your enemy in melee with impunity, by using invisibility. They will hit you back if you melee, cast ball spells or burning hands. However you can use bolt spells or attack them with missiles without causing them to see you. Plus, you can shoot missiles while invisible, but not in the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farsight&lt;br /&gt;Normally monsters will see you before you see them. This is unfortunate because some monsters are very fast, strike from a distance or summon other monsters. With a limited field of vision these monsters can hit you or even have you surrounded, and darkness might not always be able to save you. Farsight allows you to see enemies before they see you. It can save your life, by lowering the chance that some monster (especially black wizards) will sneak up on you and start summoning monsters that can surround you. It's not necessary but nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web&lt;br /&gt;Your enemies get stuck in webs for a few turns, unless they are very powerful. Enemies can't attack you or use special powers, like summoning, when they are stuck in webs. It is a very useful spell against even some of the toughest monsters in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stun Ray&lt;br /&gt;It inflicts no damage on enemies and so is not an offensive spell. It will most likely be shrugged off by most of the monsters you would LIKE to use it on. Other spells (and other means) usually work better to achieve the same end. So why am I listing it? You might find it early! If this is the first advantage spell you get, use it. It will affect most low level monsters, and so help protect your hit points. Stun ray is effective against some higher level monsters later in the game (most notably minotaur mages), but you can use a wand of stunning to the same end and save your PP's for offense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bless&lt;br /&gt;Another under-used spell. Casting the bless spell, upon yourself, gives you the 'Blessed' status. This is the same status you get after being 'crowned' as the champion of your deity. Therefore this status is usually available to spellcasters much sooner than non-spellcasters. Specifically, it means that you have some extra luck, and lower food consumption, both very nice effects. After finding this book, your PC should not walk around unblessed in any dungeon afterward, the rewards are just too nice to miss. The more you cast it, the longer each casting will last. The castings also 'stack', like if one casting yields 100 gameturns of blessing, then two castings will yield 200, and three = 300 and so on. This is a good way of training your Mana stat, at least in the early and middle game. The 'blessed' status can be taken away (pretty rare though), if you enter a room that is "particularly unholy". These rooms are generated randomly, and it is a one-time effect, so all you have to do is re-cast the spell. If you are running out of castings though, save them for an important time in the game.  Bless can also be used as an offensive spell to inflict damage on undead monsters. Once trained to high effectivity, it can inflict a lot of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Utility spells]&lt;br /&gt;They are incredibly useful, and there are no real substitutes for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength of atlas&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing more than increase your carrying capacity. But it does increase it! Your Mana stat times 1000 worth of capacity you'll get! This means you can carry a very large inventory of useful items, and make use of a few very heavy items. Non-spellcasters simply can't do the same. If you don't have the SoA spell, carrying a large inventory means having the 'burdened', or 'strained' status. These reduce your DV, 'to hit', and increase your food consumption rate, all bad. Strength of Atlas spells also 'stack', even more so than the Bless spell, because there are no room effects that will take it away from you. Once it is cast, it is cast. If you only cast a few spells, or walk in the wilderness for extended periods, your carrying capacity may fail you. This effect may crush you if you are carrying a very heavy inventory. The game gives you several warning messages before it fails though, so pay attention to those messages, and don't take chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teleport&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the most useful spell in the game. Even if you don't have TP control, gained by eating a blink dog corpse (it allows you to TP to whatever square you want to), it will allow you to escape dangerous situations that could kill you. Some levels, like boss levels, do not allow TP because it is so powerful. If a level allows TP, the only way a monster can kill you is if it can do so with one hit. You can use TP to create distance between yourself and your enemy, and continually use bolt spells to kill them. Creative use of TP will allow you to gain access to otherwise inaccessible places, and also some early access to some very good equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Healing Spells]&lt;br /&gt;Self-explaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Light Wounds&lt;br /&gt;The most useful healing spell you will get. It's not the most powerful, but it will most probably be available much sooner than the others. It is cheap on PP's and therefore easily trained. Once trained it can yield 20-30 HP's per 2-3 PP's for casting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Serious/Critical wounds and Heal&lt;br /&gt;If you train them, they can be useful, but potions will probably serve better. They are more costly in terms of PP's and you would be lucky to´find them early.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  03.  CHOOSING A PLAYING STYLE&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Now that we understand a bit about our spells we need to think about gameplay. The most important thing about choosing a wizard is this, how many spell castings do you get from reading a book. This is primarily determined by your Learning stat. A troll wizard that starts with a book of fire bolt, may wind up with a castings score as low as 100 (note: this does not mean 100 castings. With each casting, your casting score decrements by more than 1.) A grey elven wizard may start with that same book and obtain over 1000. This means you have to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of style do you want to play in? There are two choices, a pure wizard, and a fighting wizard. A pure wizard would start with high Learning, Willpower and Mana stats and so rely on magic to kill nearly every monster in the game, only using melee and missiles as a fallback. Fighting wizards would prefer better physical stats to start and thus rely on non-magical means of combat, only using magic in tight spots, or when it's advantageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons to play a pure wizard style:&lt;br /&gt;High Mana means lots of PP, so you can depend on your spells heavily, and train spells quickly. High Learning stat means lots of castings available, this is VERY important, as you do NOT want to run out. Also you will be capable of learning very powerful spells right away. If you can find a way to increase your stats in the game, especially Strength, Toughness, and Dexterity, you will become a respectable fighter. Also finding (or smithing) good equipment will make you a very respectable fighter, regardless of class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons not to play a pure wizard style:&lt;br /&gt;A low starting Toughness stat means you can die at any time in the early game, if you are unlucky enough to step on a stone block trap. There is not much to be done about it unfortunately. After you get a few levels up, it won't be such a problem. But at the beginning, every step could be your last! There are also a few monsters that are difficult to kill with magic, they are either resistant to elemental magic, or just really good at 'shrugging off' your bolts. For this reason you should train missile skills and also some melee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons to play a fighting wizard style:&lt;br /&gt;You will likely have enough toughness to survive most trap accidents, though this is not guaranteed. You will still have ACCESS to spells, which other classes would not. Limited castings aren't a big problem if you're careful with them. Getting few castings per book isn't such a big deal if you have lots of books, and you will find many in the game. If you can find a way to increase your stats in the game, especially Learning, Willpower, and Mana, you can become a powerful wizard later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons not to play a fighting wizard style:&lt;br /&gt;The Learning stat is one of the more difficult stats to train, if you start with a low one, you will be stuck with it for a while. The Mana stat is easier to train, just cast lots of spells, this will cause your PP's to constantly regenerate and thus train Mana. The problem with this is that if your Learning stat is low you won't have many spellcastings to work with. Also as far as fighting characters go, wizards are pretty lousy. The wizard class yields low HP, low healing rate, and a miserable fighting skillset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  04.  SKILLS&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Starting skillsets for all wizards consists of these skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alchemy = Allows you get recipes to mix magical potions. Most are useful for all races, but longevity potion is very useful for short-lived races.&lt;br /&gt;Concentration = Helps regenerate PP more quickly. Get this to 100 as soon as possible. This is the most important skill you have.&lt;br /&gt;Healing = Helps regenerate HP more quickly. A high priority definitely.&lt;br /&gt;Herbalism = Without it you only pick cursed herbs. A high score helps you pick more (and more blessed) herbs from each bush. Another high priority.&lt;br /&gt;Literacy = Usually starts at 100 for wizards.&lt;br /&gt;Stealth = Enemies won't always notice you as soon as your in their line of sight. Also at 100 helps you get the weird tome from the ghost librarian. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Ventriloquism = Maybe confuse your enemy for a turn or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also all PC's get:&lt;br /&gt;Climbing - At 100 you can enter the Rift.&lt;br /&gt;Haggling - Worthless.&lt;br /&gt;First Aid - Sometimes useful to fight poison in the very beginning of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skills that can be acquired in-game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Bart:&lt;br /&gt;Backstabbing = Not as useful for wizards as other classes. Combine it with invisibility if you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Tactics = Better modifiers from the tactics setting is good for dodging. This is a high priority once you get it.&lt;br /&gt;Two Weapon Combat = Useless, as a wizard you need a shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Yergius (he teaches and trains):&lt;br /&gt;Climbing = His training in this is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Detect Traps = Press the 's' command to search for traps. Most players love it, but if you are familiar with the heavily trapped areas of the game you can do without it. You can use wands to the same end.&lt;br /&gt;Disarm Traps = You have a spellbook to do this for you, if you can find one, and the spell works a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Pick Locks = Useless. Keys and the Knock spell work better.&lt;br /&gt;Pick Pockets = Generates more items, so it's nice. Successfully using it about 20 times allows entry into the thieves guild.&lt;br /&gt;Stealth = At 100 helps you get the weird tome from the ghost librarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Guth'Alak&lt;br /&gt;Herbalism = You already have this.&lt;br /&gt;Gardening = You don't need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Tywat Pare&lt;br /&gt;Law = Worthless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Yrrigs&lt;br /&gt;Bridge Building = Frost bolt works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Old Barbarian&lt;br /&gt;Courage = Helps out if your surrounded. Verdict...don't get surrounded and you won't need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Glod&lt;br /&gt;Smithing, it can be useful if you get the equipment: Hammer, anvil, and ore. To get the anvil you probably have to kill Glod or Kherab, and you have to dig the ore from walls using a pickaxe. If Glod is alive he will fix your broken pickaxes for a price. To use Glod's forge you should lead him off the level first by means of (':s') swapping places with him and leading him down the stairs. If Dwarftown is on D:11 use a couple scrolls of blessed scrolls of peace if you have them, it will eliminate background corruption. Some players love smithing but I never use it. Digging, plus repairing pickaxes, plus creating ingots from ore, plus the actual smithing process, is boooring. It takes a lot of real life time, a lot of game time, and a lot of game turns. Of these, the game turn length is the most important game effect. More game turns = lower score (which you probably shouldn't care about yet), and also corruption, if you don't have scrolls of peace. If you want the extra DV and PV and are willing to tough out the boredom, smithing can really give your PC an edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Blup&lt;br /&gt;Swimming, not too useful. Wizards usually have other ways of dealing with water.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  05.  RACE DIFFERENCES&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment for all wizards consists of these items unless otherwise noted. Armor = robe [+0, +1], sandals [+0, +0]. Weapon = dagger (1d4) or quarterstaff (1d10). Some torches, two rings, about 3 potions, about 2 scrolls, about 2 books, an offensive wand, about 150 gp, and an iron ration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes that's one, count it ONE point of PV for an average non-troll wizard. Trolls get more because of inherent Strength and Toughness, usually 3 or 4. If you get more than two points of starting PV, the RNG (random number generator) was good to you. Watch out, it can make up for that later :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does each race bring to the table.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Humans have standard equipment, except leather boots [+0, +0] instead of sandals&lt;br /&gt;Their stats are:&lt;br /&gt;I actually won't bother listing average stats.&lt;br /&gt;For humans all stats are average, so I won't list any for humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Food Preservation = More monster corpses generated. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Swimming = Not much. (Spellcasters usually have other ways of dealing with water.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = Humans are capable of playing either style, magic or fighting dependent. If you start with high Learning, the RNG was good to you, you can really take advantage of magic. Food Preservation is one of the nicer skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = If you start out as dumb as a brick, you will run out of spells quickly and have to use melee or missiles. Trying to find some missiles and a decent melee weapons will be imperative. There is not really much about humans to make them stand out.  Their lifespan is a bit short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = Just an average wizard with Food Preservation. If you like having a luck of the draw factor, choose humans.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Trolls have standard equipment, except leather boots [+0, +0] instead of sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trollish stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Strength      very high&lt;br /&gt;Learning      very low&lt;br /&gt;Willpower          low&lt;br /&gt;Dexterity          low&lt;br /&gt;Toughness     very high&lt;br /&gt;Mana          very low&lt;br /&gt;Perception         low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Athletics  = Help your physical stats increase a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Food Preservation = More monster corpses generated. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Gemology = More gems/crystals generated. Gemology could help you find Crystals of Learning that, when blessed and 'u'sed, raise your Learning stat. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Mining = Mines faster, and pick axes break less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = Trolls make good fighting wizards. They are the easiest race to keep alive in the beginning. If you are willing to wait a long time to enjoy full use of your magic, you will have a strong character. Trolls level slowly, this can be a good thing. There are places in the game that have experience level restrictions, like perhaps a level 16 PC can enter a place, but a level 17 couldn't. This is good for trolls because they will be stronger at a given level than other classes would be, by comparison. Their skillset is really nice. Trolls heal very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = Their Learning stat is abysmal. You won't get many castings from reading your books at the beginning of the game. You might consider book casting from them or storing them to read later. They have a very short life span, and should protect themselves from ghost bats/kings by all means. Switching tactics to coward and casting spells on them will help you destroy them without being aged. Trolls level up slowly, this can be a bad thing too. You will need ridiculous amounts of experience points to get your level up after a while. Trolls regenerate PP's slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = Trolls give you a good fighter that has ACCESS to lots of spells. Wizards and necromancers as classes, find waaay more spellbooks than any other classes. This means that even if you are a miserable wizard, you will still have many spells at your disposal, that can definitely save your life.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;High Elves have standard equipment.&lt;br /&gt;High Elven stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Learning           high&lt;br /&gt;Dexterity     very high&lt;br /&gt;Toughness          low&lt;br /&gt;Mana          very high&lt;br /&gt;Perception    very high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Dodge =  Enemies miss you more often. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = High Elves are great pure wizards. They have the ability to learn some of the most powerful spells in the game from the very beginning. They have a very long life span, you won't worry about ever being aged to death by anything. They get an extra bit of Dexterity that helps them be effective with missiles. Their dodging skill is very nice. High Elves regenerate PP's quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = Low Toughness on the other hand means that you have to be very careful with their HP. You must find ammunition for missile attacks, because wizards don't start out with any. High Elves heal very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = A slight advantage in Dexterity and Toughness means they might be a bit easier to keep alive than grey elves. You might consider trying a high elf if your grey elves keep dying.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Grey Elves have standard equipment, except a loaf of elven bread, which is very nourishing, and so nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;Grey Elves stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Learning      very high&lt;br /&gt;Dexterity          high&lt;br /&gt;Toughness     very low&lt;br /&gt;Mana          very high&lt;br /&gt;Perception    very high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following skills:&lt;br /&gt;Dodge =  Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = In my opinion, they are the most powerful wizards in the game. They will rarely encounter a book they cannot read successfully, even right from the start. They have the longest lifespan of any race in the game. Some talent with missiles, and good dodging abilities helps protect your HP. Grey Elves regenerate PP's very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = Very low Toughness. Low HP means possible death around every corner, and therefore new players might have a hard time keeping them alive. Grey Elves heal very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = If you think you can rely on magic to carry the day for you. This is the choice.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Dark Elves have standard equipment except, leather boots [+0, +0] instead of sandals, spider bread instead of an iron ration and no torches at all.&lt;br /&gt;Dark Elves stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Willpower          high&lt;br /&gt;Dexterity     very high&lt;br /&gt;Mana          very high&lt;br /&gt;Perception         high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Alertness = Helps you to evade traps and offensive magic. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Find Weakness =  Helps you to get critical hits on your enemies. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = The dark elven skillset makes them good at scoring damage on enemies in melee. A very high Dexterity stat gives them decent missile abilities, and nice Willpower and Mana stats make them effective in the (somewhat limited) magic castings they do get from reading books. Once they get some PV from decent armor they are quite powerful. They have very long life spans. Dark Elves regenerate PP's quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = Not really a lot of drawbacks here. I hate to count an average Learning stat against a race, but when it comes to wizards it really is that important. They will suffer from limited spellcastings scores. They suffer racial prejudice from dwarves, and thus get bad prices in the most important shop in the game, Waldenbrooks. Dark elves heal slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = If you don't want to put up with the drawbacks of The other races, and don't mind bad shop prices, dark elves are a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Dwarves have standard equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Dwarven noteworthy stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Strength           high&lt;br /&gt;Toughness          high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Detect Traps = It allows you to discover traps by using the 's' command. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Smithing = Nice if you have the equipment, but you can get this skill in game.&lt;br /&gt;Mining = Pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = You have a good chance of staying alive do to good Toughness, and Strength. The Detect Traps skill is very nice in the beginning, before you find other means of detecting traps, and disarming them. This skill can save your life at the start. They have long life spans. Dwarves heal fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = Their Learning stat is average , which can be time consuming to increase to high levels. That means limited castings and the most powerful spells will be off limits to you at the beginning. The skillset is nice, because of Detect Traps, but I'd rather have Food Preservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = You get high Strength, Toughness, and heal fast. In exchange you don't have to give up much. If your a player that doesn't mind spending some time to beef your character up, and really dislike restarting, dwarves are a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Gnomes have standard equipment, except gnomish boots(+1, +0) [+2, +0] instead of sandals.&lt;br /&gt;Gnomish noteworthy stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Dexterity          high&lt;br /&gt;Mana          very high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Gemology = More gems/crystals generated. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Mining = Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Ventriloquism = A skill I have seldom used. Nice if it is successful though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = Gnomes lean more toward pure wizards. They have quite long life spans.  Gemology is nice, if you know how to exploit it. They level up a bit faster than other races. They also get an extra starting talent, using it for, say, 'long stride' could give your PC an early edge. Gnomes regenerate PP's quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = They don't really stand out, elves are more magical. If you don't use the Gemology to help your Learning stat, the skillset isn't that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = The main reason for a beginner to play as a gnome is if their elven PCs keep dying, or if they really want to exploit Gemology.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings have standard equipment, except no shoes and a cursed ring.&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings noteworthy stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Strength      very low&lt;br /&gt;Dexterity     very high&lt;br /&gt;Toughness          high&lt;br /&gt;Mana               low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings bring the following noteworthy  skills:&lt;br /&gt;Archery = Gives a bonus to all your missile shooting endeavors. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Cooking = Almost useless to a wizard, the fire bolt spell will cook any corpse. Food Preservation = More corpses. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = High Dexterity plus the archery skill will help you stay alive. Your archery skill actually trains faster than weapon skills. So you will have something quite powerful in addition to your magic. They have longer life spans than humans, but not by much. They also get an extra starting talent, using it for, say, 'long stride' could give your PC an early edge. The Food Preservation is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = They make lousy fighters until they find a good weapon, and increase their very low Strength stat. Training the Strength stat isn't too hard, just time consuming. You have to walk around at 'burdened' or ''strained' status, which reduces DV a bit. You have to find your missiles, wizards don't start with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = Training Strength isn't fun, but if you have a healthy respect for archery they do have enough Toughness to make them a worthwhile choice. The cursed ring usually isn't too much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Orcs have standard equipment except leather boots [+0, +0] instead of sandals.&lt;br /&gt;Orcish noteworthy stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Strength      very high&lt;br /&gt;Learning           low&lt;br /&gt;Toughness          high&lt;br /&gt;Mana          very low&lt;br /&gt;Perception         low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orcs bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Backstabbing = I don't backstab often, but it might be nice if you like it.&lt;br /&gt;Find Weakness = Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Mining = Faster digging. Kind of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = Good physical stats and Find Weakness means better melee results. They're ok if you play them as fighting wizards, relying on magic only in tight spots. They have a lot of the advantages of trolls, but without the leveling difficulties. Orcs heal fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = They have short life spans, beware ghosts. Low Learning and Mana stats hinder wizards, and orcs don't have the Gemology skill to help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = You would consider them as an alternative to trolls. If troll leveling issues bother you choose 'troll lite'. And they do seem to regenerate PP much faster than trolls.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings have standard equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings noteworthy stats are:&lt;br /&gt;Strength           high&lt;br /&gt;Willpower          high&lt;br /&gt;Toughness          high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings bring the following noteworthy skills:&lt;br /&gt;Swimming = Not too useful to wizards.&lt;br /&gt;Alertness = Dodging spells and traps. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Food Preservation = Yummy, more dead bodies.&lt;br /&gt;Music = Use an instrument and tame those cats. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros = Both Alertness and Food Preservation. They make this a great skillset for wizards. They don't suffer from any major drawback in stats. All drakelings have acid breath, which can damage enemies. Acid breath also reduces your satiation level, and so allows you to eat as many corpses as you want, without becoming bloated for a long period of time. (This is nice because many corpses have stat increasing effects). They also enjoy increased speed if they become heated by way of environment or attack. Drakelings heal fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons = They suffer decreased speed if they become cold. They have lifespans about as short as humans. They suffer fire damage in the Tower of Eternal Flames, (after a certain amount of turns) no matter how fire resistant you are. Again, average Learning means average wizard, at least in the beginning. You'll need lots of books, missiles and luck in finding a good weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary = Pretty good skills and stats. The drawbacks aren't bad if you're careful. I'd say chose drakelings if you think the stats you gain from corpse munching will offset your rather average magic abilities.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  06. BIRTH-MONTH CONSIDERATIONS&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Raven - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;+10 to speed makes it powerful. The rune covered trident being available earlier is nice, but it is a two handed weapon. That means if you use it you have no shield, which is bad for wizards. +2 Perception is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book - notable effects:&lt;br /&gt;Not as powerful as you might think considering it gives "Increased chance to learn spells". That's basically all it gives. Still nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wand - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;This month is all about neutrality, 10% more PP and +2 Mana if you start out neutral. That means Humans, Grey Elves, Gnomes, and Drakelings can give it a look, but not the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unicorn - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;I love it for the +2 Appearance. Seriously, less corruption is worth thinking about. I would prefer other months though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salamander - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;Very powerful for wizards. If you are born in this month you are almost guaranteed of starting with a spellbook of firebolt. That makes the "20% cheaper PP cost for all fire magic" effect very nice! Once you find a fireball spellbook this effect is even nicer. The +3 Mana helps a little, but the '20% more PP always' effect is very desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragon - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;I might be differing with popular opinion here, but I think this one is yet another excellent sign for wizards. This sign drains the Willpower stat and puts it into Strength and Toughness. This may seem like a very bad thing for wizards at first, but the Willpower stat doesn't have to be high to have powerful magic. Training your spells will net a much better increase in the power of your magic than 3 points of Willpower. The Willpower stat can be trained later, to make up what was lost, and you'll never know the difference. But the extra Strength and Toughness means your more likely to live. More dramatic tactics modifiers is good, if you don't want more extreme tactics then just don't bother switching them. It really just means better dodging as far as cowardly wizards are concerned. And combat magic is 10% cheaper in PP's. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sword - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;+1 Learning, tempting but other signs are nicer. The tactics and melee skill marks bonuses are nice, they could help your character get a few more DV points from their shield/spear combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falcon - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;Survival skill shmurvival skill. +2 Willpower, blah. The free talent...put it into 'strong legs'. Worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cup - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;Faster leveling = good. More spellcastings per book = good.&lt;br /&gt;More skill advances = good. +2 Learning = really good.&lt;br /&gt;Cup = One of the best star signs for wizards.&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to play a PC that has exremely high Learning to start, and don't care much for increased spellcastings, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candle - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;Faster healing is not that good for wizards for these reasons: Wizards start with the healing skill, this give adequate healing. Once a wizard finds a healing spellbook, it renders Candle obsolete. Faster intrinsic healing can lead a wizard to carelessness with their HP's. More prayers might be nice for some. 1 free talent, could be used for +1 Learning, or whatever. Nice. This sign could be a help until you find your first healing spellbook, after that it's worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;+3 Willpower, nice but not a difference maker.&lt;br /&gt;+3 Perception, see +3 Willpower.&lt;br /&gt;Food is more nutritious. Nice...I guess.&lt;br /&gt;There are better months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tree - notable effects for wizards:&lt;br /&gt;+5 Willpower, reminds me of Wolf but with less variety. If Willpower is important to you, then consider it. Otherwise no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Cup and Salamander appear to be the best for wizards. Book is worth a look too. Normally I don't care what star sign I get, I'll even take Falcon if I roll it. A funny thing about that is, that I have more game winning wizards born in the month of the raven, than any other birthmonth. So I'm ranking Raven near the top too.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  07. THE TALENT SYSTEM&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here. The strategy for what to invest in is entirely dependent on what playstyle you want. In general a pure wizard would invest in quickness early, then magic, then defense. A fighting wizard though, would value the missile talents, and maybe even melee, over magic. The talents are self-explanatory. I think that if the talent complements the way you want to play then it's worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heir gift for a wizard is a wand of fire with 30 charges. Not worth it because you will have spells instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treasure hunter. It's probably the best talent. You need Alert and Miser to get it, so pick Alert as your first talent. It's good to get it early but consider choosing a quickness talent before Miser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickness talents = These mean being able to outrun most difficult monsters early on. Consider getting the Quick talent early. If you want more than one that's fine, but one should be enough. I consider Quick to edge out Long stride only because Quick opens up the quick shot missile talents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DV talents = Good for every wizard early or late game. They won't make a big difference though, as the tactics setting, along with a lot of other means, will give you decent DV. Choose these if you just want every defense edge you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PV talents = Nice for the beginning. Not so great for the later game, compared with the talents you could chose. Wizards should invest most of their talents elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic talents = Potent, Strong, and Mighty Aura aren't so impressive, but they open up the rest. I highly recommend all the magic talents, especially Charged and Strong Magic. I don't recommend the Bookcasting talents though,they are just not that useful to wizards. That leaves ten worthwhile magic talents all together, that eats up 30 levels of increases if you get them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missiles talents = If you plan to depend on missiles give them a look. The quickshot talents are really nice, but it takes a lot to get to Missile Weapons Master. Alert + Good Shot + Keen Shot + and 3 missile weapon affinities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melee talents = Most are useless to wizards, but the Basher talents yield impressive results, needing no pre-requisites. There are two weapons in the game that wizards can take great advantage of, if they have the Strength of Atlas spell. Big Punch = 800 stones and is a one-handed weapon, meaning you get great melee damage without losing much DV. Also the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor = 1200 stones, it's a two-hander but fantastic in damage and critical hits. Basher+Powerful Strike+Mighty Strike=(+6, +6) on any +100 stone weapon. They are worth considering after you get Big Punch.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  08.  WIZARD CROWNING GIFTS&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Listed in no particular order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brannalbin's Cloak of Defense [+3, +3] Weight: 30 stones&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to fire.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to cold.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to acid.&lt;br /&gt;It grants invisibility.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to shock attacks.&lt;br /&gt;A nice gift to get because using it doesn't take up a valuable item slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ring of Immunity [+5, +5] Weight: 1 stone&lt;br /&gt;It grants immunity to fire.&lt;br /&gt;It grants immunity to acid.&lt;br /&gt;It grants immunity to cold attacks.&lt;br /&gt;It grants immunity to shock attacks.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice gift because it is one of the nicest rings in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robes of Resistance (-4, -4) [+3, +12] {To+5} Weight: 60 stones&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to fire.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to acid.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to shock attacks.&lt;br /&gt;For those of us that don't care for smithing, this is great armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staff of the Archmagi (+5, 5d2+2) [+9, +0] {Ma+10} Weight: 40 stones&lt;br /&gt;It modifies your mana attribute by +10.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to acid.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to sleep attacks.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to confusion attacks.&lt;br /&gt;Resistance to sleep attacks! Woo-hoo! When you reach exp. level 50, and enter the Small Cave and start hunting Jackelwares, make sure you have this equipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staff of the Wanderer (+2, 3d8+2) [+6,+3] {To+6} Weight: 40 stones&lt;br /&gt;It modifies your toughness attribute by +6.&lt;br /&gt;It grants immunity to shock attacks.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to fire.&lt;br /&gt;It grants resistance to sleep attacks.&lt;br /&gt;Some features are nice, but it's a two-handed weapon. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  09.  EQUIPMENT&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I think, for a wizard's early game, you should set your sights for good uncursed equipment, rather than trying on every thing that comes your way, in hopes of getting an extra PV point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head- In the early game do 'equip-identify' a helmet, a +1 metal helmet works fine. Later you will exchange this for a higher metal cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neck- Marble amulet probably, if not try 'equip-identifying' amulets. Willpower +3 work nice. Later you will exchange this for an amulet of rapid healing, free action, or the ankh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body- Find some leather armor and probably stick with that for a while, unless it gets damaged. The studded variety is nice, but weighs 100 stones more. The heavier armors are only worth it if they offer really nice PV. Later you will exchange this for higher metal armor or the Ancient Mummy Wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girdle- You should be careful about 'equip-identifying' these. A cursed girdle prevents changing armor.  Later you will exchange this for a girdle of carrying or a higher metal girdle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloak- A [+1, +0] cloak is realistic, but 'equip-identifying' cloaks isn't so bad. Cloaks get destroyed pretty easily. Later you will exchange this for cloaks of protection/defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right Hand- An orcish spear is easy to find, just tease one out of an orc scorcher/chieftain or hill orc. Keep running away from them while they're next to you, or maybe one step away from you, they'll throw eventually. If you get a cursed weapon it will prevent you from changing your gauntlets and rings. Later you will exchange this for a higher metal weapon or an artifact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left Hand- I find wooden shields preferable to medium shields due to rust. Later you will exchange this for a higher metal shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right ring- Don't 'equip-identify' in this slot, as the effects for the ring you wear will be magnified on the right hand. Rings of damage if available. Later you will exchange this for a ring of slaying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left ring- Do it here instead. Rings of cold and fire resistance are nice, unless you find an uncursed ring of damage. Any good ring should be a righty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracers- Do 'equip-identify' any bracers you find until your happy. Later you'll be doing the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gauntlets- Do not 'equip-identify' these because you can't change rings if they are cursed. Later you will exchange this for the Elemental Gauntlets, or thick gauntlets if you have poison hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boots- It's unlikely to find good leather or light boots. If you find iron, heavy, or spiked boots, give them a try.  Later you will exchange this for blessed seven league boots, protect these at all cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missile weapon- I say 'equip-identify' one. If it's not cursed, stick with it until it's destroyed. Later you will exchange this for a bow of accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missile- Cursed missiles aren't a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tool- Torches are useful for extending your field of vision. Use torches before moments like entering the Big Room in the caverns of chaos. Later you will exchange this for the Elemental Orb of Water/Fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  10.  PESKY MONSTERS&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I know I won't get them all. I list mostly the ones that are pesky considering the experience level you will be at when you are likely to meet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Golems: Resistant to acid and frost bolt and they see in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;Greater Daemon: Sees in the dark, fire resistant, shoots fire bolts, drains your stats and to top it all off, he teleports. Geez!&lt;br /&gt;Karmic baby (or not baby) dragons-Resists fire/ice/lightning/acid and you can't melee them without getting cursed or worse.&lt;br /&gt;Ogre Magus: Shoots ice bolts, they can be deadly if you don't have darkness.&lt;br /&gt;Mage Bane/Doom eyes: They drain your PP's. Only really bad in a group.&lt;br /&gt;Mimics: If they get that first paralyzing hit on you it could be over.&lt;br /&gt;Revenant: They regenerate, and are good at shrugging off bolts. Very pesky if you meet one early.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  11.  WISHING&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Amulet of life saving, if Khelevaster is not saved yet. Maybe red dragon scale mail if desperate for fire resistance in the Tower of Eternal Flames. Possibly rings of ice for the tower. Seven league boots are a great choice. If there is a skill you like, Find Weakness, Food Preservation, or any other except Alertness. One more possibility is wishing for a chaos wizard. Chaos wizards summon writhing masses of primal chaos, and chaos warriors, that, when killed, give large amounts of experience points, allowing you to gain possibly several levels. The writhing masses and especially the chaos warriors drop really great items (eternium plate mails, boots, helmets, long swords, shields, and so on) thus ensuring some nice prefixes or suffixes on some of them. Unfortunately, they also summon chaos servants and greater chaos servants. If you kill too many of these they become super powerful. This is bad because you have to kill many of these later in the temple levels. If you try this, do so in a dungeon level that you won't need to visit again, later in the game. That way if the wizard summons servants, you can just lead him to a higher dungeon level, and leave the others behind. Some of the Tomb of the High KIngs levels work nice.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  12.  WIZARD ORIENTATION&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Wizards are powerful enough to defeat some very powerful monsters early in the game because of their strong magic attacks. Gaining experience levels is a very good thing for wizards because Spellcasting gets cheaper by 10% at level 6, 20% at level 12 and 40% at level 18. At exp. level 32 they can recharge wands (once per wand). At level 40 they get a useless uncursing talent. And at level 50, they get knowledge in all known spells (except wish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime in the game you will run out of PP's, it happens. Then you decide if you want to cast out of your HP's. If you do this your Mana stat will probably be drained by a point. Only do this if there is no reasonable alternative. At some point you'll have to cast spells from your HP's. When your HP's get low you can heal yourself by casting healing spells from your HP's. I know this sounds too good to be true, but it's true. Cure Light Wounds costs little and gives lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economy with your spells is important. Don't fire a bolt at every monster that comes your way, this is a waste, and will cause you to run out of castings. Before bolting monsters you should first run from them. If you are lucky, they will stop chasing you, allowing you to progress in the game, and use your spells on more powerful (and therefore experience point rich) monsters. If those pesky monsters don't give up, you will have to bolt them. But at least try to get the monsters chasing you to line up in a row, (just run away from them in a straight line) that way you can blast several monsters with one shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your HP's ever drop below 1/3, movement energy points decrease, but only if you're tactics are set to coward. This is very useful for outrunning monsters. Sometimes you will want to run away from some hard hitting monsters. If your speed isn't good enough by it's self, try using a 'monster shield' tactic. Run from a powerful monster until you find a weak one, now run from both, towards a narrow tunnel. Only one monster can follow right next to you, there is a chance that it will be the weak one. If it is you can safely heal or find the stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teleportation is very good for wizards, spells are best. If you have no spell you can make do with a wand. There is a gauranteed wand in the Very Dusty Dungeon level. To get it, you need a scroll of magic mapping, or a wand of item detection to let you know where to teleport to. You also need teleport control. Just activate a teleport trap, teleport to the wand, pick it up, teleport back by means of the stairs, and you're done. Use booze to recharge it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corruption is a factor for every class, but not such a big factor for a wizard. With a high spellcasting score on the teleport spell, you don't have to worry about running out. When you are in deep (therefore highly corrupting) dungeons, use teleportation heavily, to reduce the number of game turns spent in them. If you run out of PP's in a highly corrupting area, don't recover them there, find a less corrupting place to recover, then return. A wizard can use magic to fight monsters that have a corrupting touch, this means they can keep their tactics on coward the whole time, thus reducing the number of corrupting hits they take. Clearing tension rooms and vaults in deep dungeon levels can corrupt non-spellcasters severely. Think about it, if you have hundreds of monsters, even if you kill most of them with two or three hits, you'll still be spending a lot of game turns on a highly corrupting level. Wizards on the other hand can clear any room very quickly with spells, further reducing corruption. It is possible for a wizard to win the game without ever generating a scroll or potion of chaos resistance, and still leave the game with NO corruption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When corruptions do kick in, use morgia and moss to help your stats. Thick gauntlets are the work around for the 'poison hands' corruption. If you find some means of chaos resistance, save it to undo the 'stiff muscles' or 'mana battery' corruptions.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  13.  LIMITED WALK-THROUGH&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I will go through a good option of how to start out, quite in depth. (Maybe a little too in depth, after re-reading it). It's just one option (tried to optimize for benefits vs. risk) but as a wizard all starting scenarios are available to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon entering the Drakalor Chain you should enter Terinyo. Now read all your spellbooks until they disappear.(I know some opinions differ, but this is one workable option, and it's what I do). If your PC is an idiot, maybe read them a couple times, and then stash or carry them for a while, you can finish them off later. Drink all beneficial potions (except a potion of gain attribute, which should be blessed before drinking for dramatically better results), equip your rings (except ring of the fish, because it is auto-cursing) and equip your weapon (surely you didn't think your wizard would know how to hold a dagger, without being told, did you?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Terinyo, buy some large rations from the shop. You can also talk to the villagers to open some quests. The village elder's quest and the druid's quest are mutually exclusive. As a wizard, you will most likely benefit more from the druid's quest, which can yield a spellbook of frost bolt. This quest is kind of hard, so you might want to leave it until later. Talking to the tiny girl opens the puppy quest, again it's kind of hard, maybe leave it until later too. Talking to the sheriff opens a quest to kill a Raider Lord in the wilderness, with your bolt spells he's no problem, but it's sometimes a pain to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what should you do now? Kill the crime boss in the neighboring town. This is a safe way to get 1000's of gp, about five experience levels, and after talking to the sheriff, an amulet of law. But before killing him, you should make a few other kills in Lawenilothehl first, and note your first kill specifically. If you run out of PP's at any time, exit the town and recover PP's in the wilderness, then re-enter. A smart player would lead a cloaked ratling named Skriek out of this unlawful town before attacking the crime lord. If Skriek is in this town when you attack Hotzenplotz, he becomes hostile. This is bad, because he sells keys, that can save a wizards life from trapped doors. Lead Skriek to Terinyo, there he will sell keys to you for the rest of the game, if you have the gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killing the crime lord, and bodyguards is simple. Just repeat the process of: bolt, exit town, re-enter, and bolt again until he dies. An important thing to remember though, acid/fire/lightning bolts can destroy the gp's that he and his body guards leave, so don't destroy your gold. While in the crime town, talk with the master thief and consider becoming a member of the thieves guild. Check out the black market, there might be a good book to buy. Return to Terinyo, get your law amulet from the sheriff, get some food and leave, your done here for now.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;So what's next. Three words: The Infinite Dungeon&lt;br /&gt;Hereafter referred to as 'the ID' cause it sounds cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ID is such a powerful feature in the game that some think that using it is like setting yourself up for an easy win. I think that as long as you don't use it until your fingers start to bleed, it's a fine way to start out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be controversial to recommend item scumming in the Id, but it is an effective way of getting books. The process involves going up and down the ID staircases, to generate an unlimited supply of new rooms, and therefore an unlimited supply of items laying in those rooms. If you do this for a while on say levels 1-2 to start out, then 3-4, and up to 8-9, you will have a good supply of books and items. Note that you can still die in the ID, it's just a bit safer than most other dungeons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On levels 3 and deeper of the ID it is possible for Blink Dogs to appear. Blink dog corpses, when eaten, give you teleport control, which is extremely valuable. If a Blink Dog appears, make it hostile by attacking it as lightly as you can, you don't want to kill it. In fact name it using the 'n' command, this will help you keep up with it. Just run from him until he summons, kill the spares and repeat, until you get your corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should consider staying in the ID long enough to get one or two bolt spells, Darkness spell, and a few points of DV and PV. You don't HAVE to stay until you get the Darkness spell, (The ID can get boooring) but I highly recommend it. When you find equipment that looks like it might give some PV, consider 'equip identifying' it. It might be cursed of coarse, making it un-removable, so you don't want to try this with girdles or gauntlets, you might get stuck with them for a while. In most cases cursed items aren't too bothersome, even gauntlets of peace (auto cursing and (-15, -15) [+3, +3]) aren't too bad if you are relying on mainly magic. Potions of water appear on ID level 6 and below, these can be dropped on a co-alligned alter later for blessing (if your deity is 'very pleased' with you), this and scrolls of uncursing solves cursed inventory problems.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Cavern of Chaos&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend visiting the BUGWIL first, because it requires careful tactics. You can die from one hit there. However, a wizard is capable of killing VERY powerful monsters there, thus gaining up to level 13. If you want to try the Bug Temple before the Caverns of Chaos, you can read the section on the Bug Temple and give it a try. But like I said, I recommend not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noteworthy dungeon levels:&lt;br /&gt;Arena - I say fight many fights in the arena, to get lots of gold. Just don't become champion just yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Room - HERBS! Yay!  Have full HP's and PP's before entering. Walk along the top first, running away from any enemies you see. Don't fight enemies right away, it slows you down, and more will just take their place (believe me). Remember where the stairs are, you can flee back down them if things get rough, this will get you away from the high monster generation rate of the Big Room. Your goal is to make 2x2 squares of herbs. Even if the 2x2 square is missing one herb, that's ok, it will regenerate. The most important herbs for wizards are morgia root (eating 2 trains Toughness and 4 trains Willpower = 25) and moss of morrelian ('u'sing 2 uncursed or blessed trains Dexterity = 25). You have to double all herb amounts to train stats beyond their potential maximums. Most other herbs are useful too, so try to stabilize as many 2x2 bush patterns as you can, but morgia and moss are the highest priority. You will probably wind up picking well over 100 morgia, to use all through the game. But you don't have to pick them all at once though. To find out what bush has what herbs, either apply the herbalism skill or pick from the bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dwarftowm&lt;br /&gt;There will be an alter generated on this level, either neutral or lawful, depending on your alignment upon entering the level. This is a very important alter in the game, so if you want it lawful, don't enter until your law amulet has done it's work. Upon entering the town first talk to Thrundarr about 'gate' and 'quest'. Your quests are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kill a specific monster - Can be easy or very frustrating. Try to find it in the Big Room, as this will help you gather herbs, while generating lots of monsters. Make trips to Dwarftown to sell junk you may collect in big room. Spend the money however you like, training, shop items, piety, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cross the animated forest - Easy because trees can't see in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kill some ogres - They also can't see in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become champion in the arena - Did I mention that ogres can't see in darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kill a greater demon - To kill him is hard, to sacrifice him is easy.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Free the spirit of Griff Bloodaxe - You have to travel back east, find the little grey plus sign in the lower right hand corner. Kill all the enemies, on the outside with bolt spells being careful not to toast your items. Before descending the staircase, you might want to drop your inventory on the stairs. This will prevent item destruction due to the fact that the tomb is a heavily trapped area. If you have the Detect Traps skill, then you don't have to drop your items. First do an exploring trip through the dungeon, but don't try to beat it. This exploring trip lets you discover all the traps without risking your inventory. Now ascend the staircase, pick up your inventory, and re-equip whatever you took off. Now return to beat the level, your chances of setting off traps are greatly reduced because you've already discovered them. Utilize invisibility (probably potions), not darkness once you get to Griff and the necromancer. This will keep the ghuls and friends off of you, long enough for you to 'u'se holy water on the grave. That destroys Griff. The necromancer can't see in the dark, so use that to neutralize him, and invisibility to neutralize the others. Dig the grave to get a good sword, kill a bone golem to get good gauntlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next job is to get the Ancient Mummy Wrapping from the pyramid. Enter before you reach exp. level 17. The pyramid is heavily trapped also, so consider using the 'stash your inventory' trick if you don't have the Detect Traps skill. Rehetep isn't difficult for a wizard to beat. If there is a karmic baby dragon, or some other annoying monster on Rehetep's level, try to avoid it if possible. Remember, you don't have to beat every monster. Before leaving the pyramid, search the first level and find a pickaxe and a climbing set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is the Tomb of the High Kings to get the Ring of the High Kings. You need the frost bolt spell first (obtainable by way of the druid's quest). You might find some herbs in this dungeon, that's good because you might not have gotten all the bush types you needed in the Big Room. Eventually you will come to a red lake. Drop your inventory (because ice bridges only hold 2000 stones), make an ice bridge to the door, open the door and return to pick up your inventory. The Skeletal King will try to confuse you, if he does, DON'T keep trying to walk. You might fall into the lake and instantly die. Just attempt spells instead, even when confused you have about a 30%-50% chance of success. You can easily dispatch the Skeletal King with magic, but make sure you have some way of healing. Don't forget this next step or you will die, DROP your inventory again before crossing the ice bridge again to collect the ring.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Caverns of Chaos Part 2&lt;br /&gt;Get more herbs Finish whatever dwarf quests you wish, give bart the Golden Gladius, and dive deep into the caverns. First we talk to Khelevaster, thus killing him. Unless you have an amulet of life saving, or can wish for one. If you do, give it to him. If not, collect the wand of digging and stuff, and go on. If you wish very much to save Khelevaster, it might be worth it. The rewards are VERY nice, including a book of teleport and scrolls of chaos resistance. So if your PC is tough, or has the lightning ball spell, consider clearing darkforge before letting Khelavaster die. There are pools in Darkforge that MIGHT yield a wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is the graveyard, kill the undead and eat the wight and wraith corpses. This will draw your alignment toward chaotic though, so if you have high piety try not to convert. Dig through the far wall into the center room and descend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Water Temple&lt;br /&gt;Ok now it's water temple time, this is ridiculously easy. No monsters in the water temple can see in the darkness. Not the water snakes/grues/demons/elementals, chaos servants or even the Snake from Beyond. You can even step on the alter in the darkness to collect the water orb, and not worry about being sacrificed. A note though, in the darkness you will not receive the message "do you want to enter the water?", you just enter it. So be careful and don't drown yourself ok. Also beware of monsters panicing in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go a bit deeper, all the while using morgia and moss to continually train Your stats. You will come to a staircase you can't pass, that means you need The fire orb. So back to the surface again.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Darkforge&lt;br /&gt;Before tackling the tower clear darkforge. The steel golems are highly vulnerable to lightning, but they shrug off a lot of bolts. If you have the lightning ball spell, it's a breeze though, and you should consider clearing darkforge earlier, as the rewards are nice. You can use Big Punch to kill them in melee, just keep a VERY close eye on your HP's and don't take chances. Don't wear any thing that isn't fireproof while fighting them, it will get destroyed. Loot the weapons and armor room, and get the Steel Crown, and consider selling all the junk in Dwarftown. You can drink from the pools in darkforge if you wish, but you might get doomed. So if you drink, make sure you have a way of getting excellent piety fast, for doom removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tower of Eternal Flames&lt;br /&gt;Before entering the tower you need: A blessed fireproof blanket, some means of fire resistance, a means of digging, food, some blessed potions of extra healing, some other means of healing (spells or spensweed), the frost bolt spell, some cursed potions of invisibility (curse them yourself with some unholy water), potions of blindness and confusion work to if you have them, some uncursed potions of invisibility (if you don't have the spell), some wands of door creation, about 200 HP's and the teleport spell (you can do it without teleport, but it's much safer with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is imperative to limit your inventory! The more items you carry with you the faster your blanket will fail. You may take some items that you like, but do limit them. Wear only fireproof items, the rest will burn up. If you have a ring of ice, that's nice, but you really need to wear two blessed rings of ice to guarantee item safety. Kill the fire enemies with frost bolt, yes they will shrug a lot off, but keep blasting and you'll get them. When you run out of PP's exit the tower and recover in the wilderness, this is what the food is for.&lt;br /&gt;The Ancient Chaos Wyrm is one of the toughest enemies you will face, considering your level, and equipment restrictions. Have Willpower, Dexterity, and Toughness all at least 25 before fighting him. You can equip the water orb and Sword of Nonnak for an additional 15 points of Willpower. First tunnel in and frost bolt the demons, grues and elementals. The only monsters that see invisible are the Ancient Chaos Wyrm and the chaos servants. The only monsters that can see in the dark are the Ancient Chaos Wyrm and fire demons.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you 'wake up' the Ancient Chaos Wyrm before you run out of PP's, you will know he is awake when you get the message 'you feel some force attacking your mind', so you will exit the tower and recover PP's. When you resume the fight, your goal is to lead the Ancient Chaos Wyrm to the stairs. The temple level doesn't allow teleportation, but the level just below it does. Utilize 'monster shields' (fire grues and such) to prevent getting hit by the Wyrm's energy bolts on the way back to the stairs. Use your wands of door creation (it's a good idea to have created these doors in strategic locations before luring The Wyrm, and just close them as you pass) to keep The Ancient Chaos Wyrm from getting you in his line of sight. This prevents his confusion attack attempts. When your on the stairs, he won't immediately come to stand next to you. So you will trade bolts with him for a while, when you get hit, descend the stairs and heal. Ascend the stairs and repeat. If he confuses you, don't stumble around, just use the stairs. He will eventually stand next to you. Lead him down and teleport to get some distance. Equip your potions of blindness in your missile slot and teleport back. Blind him and unequip your potions (this keeps them from destruction). Use your bolt spells, and if you have them, ball spells now. If he recovers his vision and hits you, teleport away and heal, don't take chances. If he confuses you attempt to teleport a few times, but drink a potion of extra healing if you get hit. He'll panic soon and then you've got him.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Caverns of Chaos part 3&lt;br /&gt;Remember that wall of unpassable flames...now pass it. Also pass the Eternal Guardian by wearing the Ring of the High Kings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Casino&lt;br /&gt;Upon entering the casino make a habit of equipping an amulet of free action. This gives protection from the guaranteed master mimic in the gift shop. If you have none then use darkness, but that means the mimic might get one free hit on you (it could be the death of you). Try invisibility plus the highest DV you can get. Gather all the items and identify them. Pick out what you like and notice how much it costs all together. Gamble at the slot machine that has a 24 gp price on it, get the gold you need,  Also get an extra amount to ensure enough piety for crowning. When you get stunned at your winnings, don't stumble around, clean your 'E'ars instead. Get your shopping done, and travel to a desired alter, probably Dwarftown. You'll find the shortcut just a few levels down from the casino. Read all the spellbooks that you got from the casino on a non corrupting level. Then return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bunny Level&lt;br /&gt;Message ="intense tension" = Dig Kill Leave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cat Lord&lt;br /&gt;You will get a message "this level somehow seems to be removed from the rest of the world" upon entering his dungeon level. If you have killed no cats you talk to the Cat Lord and get a ring, otherwise you get a fight. You need to: see invisible (Ancient Mummy Wrapping), have potions of confusion or blindness (cursed potions of invisibility) equipped in your missile slot, and wands of paralyzation and poison are nice too. Lead off with the potions, they are 100% effective. Next utilize the wands if you have them. Then use magic spells to finish. There is no teleporting allowed on this level but you shouldn't need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Air Temple&lt;br /&gt;Another item restriction level. This time it's lightning that destroys items. Whatever. No regular monsters can see in the dark here. Not vapor rats, air grues/demons/elementals, or the chaos servants. In fact, only the chaos servants can even see invisible. Yulgash the Master Summoner can see invisible and in the dark. He is easily killed by standing outside of the door to his room and shooting magic missile bouncing around inside the room. Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth Temple&lt;br /&gt;This one is a bit harder. Most enemies here can see invisible and in the dark. Ball spells are useful but expensive in PP's because you really don't want to get surrounded by these guys (they hit hard!). Acid and lightning bolts are effective against the grues, but the elementals are really good at shrugging them off. You'll have to use acid or lightning ball spells like crazy, to kill the elementals and the Ancient Stone Beast. It might be worth considering, at this point, to sacrifice one or two points of Mana and cast ball spells out of your HP's. If you don't like that idea that's ok too, but it's a long way back to the surface, and your Mana points should regenerate soon anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mana Temple&lt;br /&gt;You should have a few wands of trap detection by now, so the traps won't be a problem. You should also have the Disarm Traps spell which is also useful. Once you navigate to the mana temple big room, just cast darkness and stand in the doorway shooting bolt spells into the room while in the dark. None of the monsters in here see in the dark, not the chaos wizards/warriors/servants/greater servants or the eyes. The wizards can summon writhing masses of primal chaos however, and they do see in the dark. The Archmage himself sees in the dark and in fact casts darkness himself. Every now and then cast light to see where every one is. Try to target your bolt spells to take out the wizards first to limit the summoning. The eyes will drain your PP's to 0. You will have to cast out of your HP's, goodbye two or three Mana points. Soon the Archmage will begin confusion attempts upon you. Now it's Archmage time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Archmage&lt;br /&gt;If you have the acid ball spell: You need to have death ray resistance (Ancient Mummy Wrapping or amulet), confusion resistance, and a wand of door creation to battle the Archmage. Retreat into the corridor. When you kill all the monsters between yourself and Nuurag-Vaarn you can utilize a created door to keep his bolt spells from hitting you. Lock the door and use 'Willpower boosted' acid ball spells to kill the Archmage, while he stands on the other side of the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have acid ball: You need death ray resistance, human slaying ammunition, confusion resistance and potions of confusion or blindness/cursed potions of invisibility. Wands of poison and paralyzation are nice too. Retreat into the corridor. When you kill all the monsters between yourself and the Archmage you can utilize a potion to confuse or blind him, these are 100% effective. You can now exploit missiles or other weapons to dispatch him. Acid bolt is effective and magic missile, but he shrugs off a lot. If you use bolt spells just don't melt your humanoid slaying ammo if you can help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ice Level&lt;br /&gt;Use a potion of uselessness in the missile slot to make yourself slide a space on the ice. This gets you a free artifact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D:50&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye to more Mana points, you won't have many PP's at this stage, and hanging around such a corrupting area to regenerate them, is a bad idea. Cast darkness and bolt most of the writhing masses of primal chaos to death first, because they see in the dark. Now angle some bouncing bolts up and downward to kill the chaos warriors. Cast light pick up any items you like and finish off the remaining writhing masses. Search for the hidden openings in the walls of the writhing masses room. Enter the tunnels and bolt the monsters to death in the dark. Try to kill the wizards first to limit their summoning. Do not handle the levers yet, and be careful to stay away from the wall that is near the center room. There is another secret door near the lever, that opens if you are near it, thus awakening the center room. Clear both secret tunnels this way. Now it's time to 'h'andle the levers, and stop the incursions of chaos into Ancardia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you have some wands of destruction you can handle a lever, destroy the lever with your wand, teleport, handle the other level, destroy it, teleport to the staircase and leave. You win. Some find this a bit cheap though. So if you don't have the wand, or if you just want some extra satisfaction, finish the game the thorough way. It is not dangerous, to kill all the monsters on the level, it just takes a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 'h'andle the levers to stop the chaos. Some balors here won't like that so they will teleport to the levers and open them. Kill the balors by bolting them to death. Do the same for the greater balor. If they get close to you, just teleport away and resume bolting them. Yes this takes a while, but so what. If you have ball spells, and don't mind healing yourself more often, you can use those for possibly quicker results. Finally all the balors will be dead and you can tackle the center room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only monsters left that can see in the dark are the ghosts and some writhing masses that may be summoned by the chaos wizards. So you should once again employ some darkness usage. Awaken the center room by finding the hidden opening near one of the levers. This gives you a good bolt spell shot at most of the chaos wizards all at once, thus limiting summoned monsters. If the ghosts surround you use ball spells. Eventually you will prevail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The White Unicorn Quest&lt;br /&gt;Before leaving the Drakalor Chain, talk to the druid in Terinyo once more. This opens the unicorn quest. Near the Old Barbarian's glade, you will find him. Talk to him then go kill the greater black unicorn. Return and get all corruptions healed. Now leave the Drakalor Chain.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Bug Temple&lt;br /&gt;This is in no way necessary to win the game. So I will cover it only briefly, and partially. I use it for quick experience levels in the early game. So that is what I will describe, the rest I will leave up to you. You might try this with some newly generated characters before trying it with a character that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No claw bugs can shrug off bolt spells, not greater or killer. Two bolt spells (acid/lightning/fire/frost) always kills greater bugs, and 3 bolt spells will kill killer bugs. Both types of bugs can sometimes travel 2 spaces in 1 turn, if your speed is about 100. Or they can travel 1 space and then hit you. For this reason, you don't want to bolt a bug that is just one space away from you. He might survive one bolt, move one space, and then hit you, thus killing a low level PC. If a greater claw bug is two spaces from you, and in line with a bolt spell, you can always kill it. It takes three to kill Killer claw bugs though. The Killer claw bug must be at LEAST 3 spaces away to safely bolt it once, and then leave the BUGWIL. Or five spaces away to bolt it to death. If more than one claw bug awakens on you at one time, simply leave and re-enter. Carefully make your way back to where you left, and you will see them again, only this time you will approach them one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before entering the BUGWIL, light a torch. This extends your field of vision by a couple of squares. Now enter the BUGWIL, move down one space, now shoot a bolt spell north-westward, this should hit a greater claw bug. One more kills it. Move all the way to the top of the screen along the right hand side of the level, no bugs should awaken on you. Now move left until you get to the tree, and bolt a bug. Probably you will have to exit. When you re-enter just carefully move upward till you see it, if it doesn't line up with a bolt spell just exit and re-enter 1 more time, then it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest is pretty much the same, just carefully move left along the top of the map, exiting when you need to. When you start awakening the killer claw bugs, you might consider leaving. But if you decide to try the killer bugs you might get a couple more experience levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/4920866956260269917/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=4920866956260269917' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/4920866956260269917'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/4920866956260269917'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2007/12/wizards-guide-by-gut.html' title='Wizard&apos;s guide (by gut)'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3710148354194913408.post-8806081913447230424</id><published>2007-12-09T12:19:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-12-09T12:24:04.076+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='soirana'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='assassin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='guide'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='contributed'/><title type='text'>Killing in Style (Guide to being an Assassin by Soirana)</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The guide of today has been made by Soirana, seasoned ADOM veteran. After reading it myself, I came to the conclusion that he knows an awful lot more about playing Assassins than me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without further ado, here it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Killing in style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;My favourite class is Assassins. The Archer is top dog in missile weapons, Barbarian probably in melee, Wizard in magic and Assassins… Well, I do believe they are best in style department. I wouldn’t recommend it to a beginner. At least when I tried them at my beginning, I died and died a lot. Even now lot of my assassins die early… usually because of trying being too stylish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep the structure and good pile of common stuff from Silfir’s guides in a modified version. Hopefully that doesn’t offend anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual information:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;ASSASSIN -- Assassins are a dark and mysterious class.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They are trained to end the life of their opponents quickly and silently. Many of them favour poisons to achieve this goal.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Assassins are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Alertness, Archery, Backstabbing, Climbing, Detect Traps, Dodge, Find Weakness, Pick Locks, Stealth, and Two Weapon Combat.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At higher levels assassins get a lot more deadly in their trade.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 6 they can create poison from any potion (except for water and fruit juice).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 12 their backstabbing powers get a lot more deadly.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 18 the range of their missile attacks is increased by 30%.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 25 their chance to score critical hits is increased by 20%.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 32 the dodge bonus they gain is doubled.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 40 they become immune to poison.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At level 50 they receive a small chance to score instant killing hits.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This chance is based upon the level of the target.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;From ADOM FAQ: about race class combo-- Thieves and Assassins are a little frail to be hack-and-slash fighters, but they start out with some nice skills, including the all-important Detect Traps. Playing them like Archers is a good strategy, but don't worry if you cannot keep them alive -- it isn't easy.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;II. Starting up the Assassin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Starsigns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I haven’t got much new to say. Spellcasting signs are not overinteresting.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If you get Concentration skill somehow, Assassin can and will be quite capable in magic. But I wouldn’t rely on that too much. Book at least will save your ass from most of bad effects if you fail to read some spellbooks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Both Candle (extrahealing, extra talent) and Raven (+10 to speed, earlier trident, 25% resistance to dopleganger’s confusion) are hard to argue as being top ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Dragon and Sword are also fine. I’d prefer Dragon as it reduces missile weapon marks and stat arrangement is very good to start with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;If I need to pick…Candle &gt;Dragon=Raven. Just because I like my assassins to survive. Powerwise Raven is a top one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. General starting equipment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Daggers: Assassins usually get heap of (stackable or not) daggers. They also get extra 4 levels in daggers and thrown daggers. If they start with a dagger in off hand that is one extra level in daggers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;All assassins also get some body armour (from clothes to elven chain armour), hood, gloves and hooded cloak. Non-hurthlings also receive leather boots. It is quite possible for some pieces to have some positive modifiers. It is also rare case for drakelings to start not being half naked. Gloves are also good for protecting rings early on. Hooded cloak does not protect worn stuff from water traps (at very least not 100%). In my opinion it works only against drenching rain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;They also start with some potions of poison that could be very very useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;3. Race-specific starting equipment, evaluation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Human:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Food Preservation, Swimming&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Assassin’s clothing/daggers + leather armour (+2PV with no drawback), long sword in right hand, dagger in left, fire-making equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Food Preservation (you can’t add very much with race to Assassin skillset... except Food Preservation of course.)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mediocre strength and toughness&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Mediocre choice. No big problems, no big gains. No real reasons to keep this race except roleplay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Troll:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Athletics, Bridge Building, Food Preservation, Gemology, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Thick furs (worse version of leather armour), heavy club + assassin clothing and dagger sets.&lt;br /&gt;Pros and Cons: Trolls race is more influential then any class you picked for them. Big club for smashing, good healing rate, exceptional strength and toughness and troll’s metabolism and huge need in experience, short lifespan (somehow that is longer than orcs, keep in mind).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And yes skills are very good to add.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Trolls survive early on and later… Later they also survive, but become a bit boring. It is okay choice, but being troll is… being troll. I’d rather pick troll barbarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) High Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: None (you would had scored for learning with elf anyway)&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Assassin sets, elven chain armour[0,+5], dual wielded short swords.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: elven chain armour, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low toughness&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: A lousy choice. Except for good body armour doesn’t got any sellpoints. Starting assassin is hardest part. Low toughness isn’t making your life easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Gray Elf:&lt;br /&gt;See high elf. Except for alignment I do not see any differences.&lt;br /&gt;e) Dark Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: None (honestly you get doubletrain on alertness and find weakness but still not impressive)&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: look High elves.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: look High elves&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low strength and toughness, problems with shop prices.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: from style position it might be nice choice. Powerwise you get all Dark Elf drawbacks for nearly no gain. I’d rather pick human. At least if I look in mirror I see human not dark elf, but that is just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Dwarf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Smithing , Metallurgy, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Assassin sets+ studded leather ([-1,+3 ] with some drawback in to-hit area) armour, hand axe, small shield (with lv1 in shields).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: good strength and toughness, nice lifespan, studded leather armour&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not really much to mention.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This is a very good choice. Dwarf gives some bones under some PV and you ready to go chopping your enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;g) Gnome:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Pick pockets, Gemology, Mining, Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Assassin sets + leather armour, short sword right hand, dagger left. Leather boots are replaced with gnomish (+2DV at least), firemaking equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Ventriloquism, extra talent, reduced need in xp.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: mediocre to low toughness.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Good choice. Gemology + Mining is awesome. Ventriloquism is very good if trained. Still, gnomes lack a bit in the physical department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Hurthling:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Cooking, Food Preservation, Gardening&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: assassin sets + leather armour, short sword in right hand, dagger in left, cursed ring, firemaking equipment, cooking set… and a boomerang.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: boomerang, higher than average Dexterity and Toughness, extra talent, Food Preservation, reduced need in xp.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: problems in strength department.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Hurthlings make nice assassins. If you are not afraid to put some work on strength it becomes best choice. I wouldn’t value boomerang much, but it is stylish and can be sold for good heap of money. As long as the cursed ring is not one of damage little ones go nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Orc:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Metallurgy, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: assassin sets, studded leather armour, battle axe (1d6+2), medium shield (+3, +1) (1lv of skill in shields).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: High strength and toughness, nice starting equipment&lt;br /&gt;Cons: very short lifespan, iirc smithing costs about 21.000gp in dwarftown.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;good choice, but you get easier start in exchange of life span problems and being screwed in dwarven shop. No more, no less.&lt;br /&gt;Of course money is a problem only early on and once you get stuff granting invisibility… none of these aging monsters sees invisible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;j) Drakeling:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Food Preservation, Music&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: assassin sets + clothes, right hand – scimitar, left - dagger, bracers of protection (+2PV which are in slot you won’t touch for a while), couple of scurgari’s in missile slot.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: High strength and toughness, Acid Breath , Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Drakelings metabolism (heat-cold problems)&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: One of top choices. Not bad equipment (very comaparable to some races like human), good stats, Acid Breath. Just keep your fingers crossed if you meet bunch of white dragons and take extra potions into Tower of Eternal Flames.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Conclusion: Assassin skillset really needs only Food Preservation (okay Concentration, Healing, Herbalism are good just you won’t get that with race and Atheletics are accessible only via being troll). Depending on preferences the best choice is between hurthlings and drakelings. Dwarves, orcs and gnomes are nice also. Other than that you can always pick something you find stylish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;4. Gender:&lt;br /&gt;Primary effect: +1to strength for males, +1 to dexterity to females. Well, troll probably benefits more from +1 strength pushing that even higher, hurthling, who needs a lot work on strength anyway, probably should pick dexterity as it is hard to train without herbs.&lt;br /&gt;Secondary: prices are based on charisma for males and appearance for females (key prices from cloaked ratling are severely affected by gender). Since assassins have some problems with charisma and appearance is easier to boost with items… Obviously being girl is profitable in Adom world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;III. Playing in style&lt;br /&gt;1. Assassins in general:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;They are not either melee powerhouses, nor best archers. And magic… wands are good. One of best things in they skillset with Alertness, Alchemy, Find Weakness, Dodge, but it needs some time and work to give results. Also most of things on assassins are plain without any DV/PV bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;Start obviously might be problematic and later on… Later on they should be deadly with missiles and melee, having some magical backup (at very least teleportation and darkness). The bonuses of to hit and to damage on level ups are more than reasonable for both missiles and melee.&lt;br /&gt;Of course you need to think whom to fight and how. But that is normal, right?&lt;br /&gt;DV, PV, to-hit, to-damage and speed are never to high. Do not forget Willpower affects wands as well. Physical stats should be a priority anyway as Assassins are fighters not flower loving book readers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;2. Getting started:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;As FAQ states early on Assassins might give some trouble. Not high hit points, no healing and… they are not supposed single-handedly obliterate crowds of monsters. Well, they will be very capable of that… later on with some level ups and trained stats.&lt;br /&gt;First thing you should do is putting heap of daggers in missile slot. 4levels in thrown daggers means +8 to hit, +6 to damage, +1 range. Add on potential bonus of Archery (about +1 to hit in most cases) with berserk archery and you will see some chance of early survival.&lt;br /&gt;Annoying thing is daggers are not offered to put in missile slot on pick up, but that means you do not waste extra turn by accidentally pressing spacebar.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind orcs throw nice knives, so you better milk them early on.&lt;br /&gt;Second, you should consider your melee weapons. Trolls can keep bashing stuff with heavy club, orcs might want to keep battleaxe, but others should examine they non-stackable daggers. Good dagger (with extra to-hit or to-damage) combined with skill in daggers (4-5levels to start, on lv5 that is +4 to-hit, +2 to-damage, +1 DV) is better than short sword and even scimitar. Leave double wielding to roleplaying guys, who know that they are doing (if you are one of these you should write guides not to read them).&lt;br /&gt;Extra stuff – you should have at least couple of [0,0] items. Well, you can sell them on black market for a few gold pieces or keep them for acid traps, explosive runes and so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Poison potions: you can dip your weapon into this, or your dagger stack (for ammo dipping limit per potion seems to be 40s (luckily that is also for dagger heaps so one potion is good for 4 daggers), or at very worst case you can throw a potion into face of your enemy. You probably should keep these for times you are in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;And don’t forget poisoned stack usually splits apart after some use. Some of daggers being poisoned, some none, and poisoned ones usually split into groups of how much poison on them is used. Poison is nice thing, but needs time to get job done so you need to run around your enemy for a while. Preferably being at coward tactics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;3. Talent choices:&lt;br /&gt;Early on:&lt;br /&gt;3.1 Heir – gift is poisonous adamantium dagger. Good but not at a cost of three talents in my opinion. Compare that to dagger thieves get and you can start complaining.&lt;br /&gt;3.2 Starting with alert and going into early treasure hunter. Items are good, more items - even better. Hard to deny… Might not be very helpful to keep character alive at low levels. At least you can pick Alert on lv1 to open up path.&lt;br /&gt;3.3 PV line with or without healthy. That has one aim - to help early in game. Surprisingly despite mithril skin this not a perfect option for dwarfs as they have starting PV and some toughness in their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;3.4 Long stride, quick, moving to quick/lightning shot ASAP (possibly picking alert at 1lv). These help early on and are still nice mid to late game. You can skip these if you a Raven born.&lt;br /&gt;3.5 Orcs and trolls should consider taking Long-lived at start.&lt;br /&gt;I always said pick Long-lived over TH for orcs and trolls, but… recently I changed my mind. Average orc has max age of 42. 30% is 12 to 13 years (depends on round up). One blessed potion of longevity gives for an orc 10-27 years in max age (my personal research). Average gain is 18. So if TH gives you one extra potion of longevity that covers Long-lived.&lt;br /&gt;Notice: potions of longevity do not stop working or became less effective if used multiples. I moved human’s max age over 1000 years in checking this.&lt;br /&gt;Still Long-lived gives immediate benefit, but before you should find yourself in trouble (pool aging, tension rooms of ghost) TH should give you some potions of longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: valuable for trolls and orcs but possibly not at a cost of TH.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Conclusion: depends on playstyle. All variants are possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Later:&lt;br /&gt;Depends on playstyle again and so on. Personally I value Missile weapon master above Melee master. Two reasons – if fighting something tough my assassins rely more on missiles, second – combined with Assasins chances for criticals I usually feel confident enough in damage output.&lt;br /&gt;Shield talents and Dodger line might also not be very good options late in game. Spear and shield combo gives ridiculous amount of DV anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential variant (1 starting talent non orc/troll non raven):&lt;br /&gt;lv1 - Alert, lv3 - Long stride (as in terms of running that gives more than Quick), lv6 – Quick, lv9&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- Miser, lv12 – Treasure hunter, lv15 – Good shot, Lv18 – Keen shot, lv21 - Quick shot, lv24 – Lightning shot, lv27- Eagle-eyed, lv30 – main melee weapon affinity, lv33- bow affinity (as they do less damage than crossbows anyway), lv36 – crossbow affinity, lv39 – wasted missile affinity (probably slings or thrown spears), lv42 – Missile weapon master, lv45 – Very Quick, lv48 – Greased Lightning.&lt;br /&gt;It is just a scheme. You might take your own way as bookcasting talents are somewhat good and there are other fine choices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;4. Assassin class powers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 6 they can create poison from any potion (except for water and fruit juice). Nice one. Keeps assassin stocked with poison. Usually I have mental problems in using this on unidentified potions, but in case of emergency I suggest you forget chances of that bubbly potion being PoGA or PoCC. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 12 their backstabbing powers get a lot more deadly.&lt;br /&gt;The real question is how much more deadly? Useful with invisibility and sort of stylish.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 18 the range of their missile attacks is increased by 30%.&lt;br /&gt;At that time you should have longbow and heavy crossbow. These (and archery and skill in proper weapons) give all range you need. Still useful with thrown weapons, including certain tridents.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 25 their chance to score critical hits is increased by 20%.&lt;br /&gt;Criticals are good. More criticals – more dead guys in no time.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 32 the dodge bonus they gain is doubled.&lt;br /&gt;If your dodge is at 100 this one is supposed to give extra 10points of DV. Sounds good.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 40 they become immune to poison.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I wanted to say, “who cares”, but if you meet tension room of quickling queens you’ll be happy. Saying that I have seen such a rooms three times in my life (two of them resulting in dead characters).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At level 50 they receive a small chance to score instant killing hits.&lt;br /&gt;This chance is based upon the level of the target. It is SMALL chance mainly for LOW level enemies. Stylish way to exterminate some goblins.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Monsters to watch out for:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Nothing too special:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;The ones, which corrode, rust weaponry (ochre jellies, rust monsters…). Shoot them or bash with appropriate weapon. Stone spear (eternium, artefacts or something you can throw away after a couple turns will also do) is good choice, and in case of rust monsters you can simply hide all vulnerable stuff in backpack. And don’t throw your daggers at rust monster (I always loved part of throwing rune covered trident at rust monster).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any monsters, which can paralyse, should be considered dangerous. Floating eyes should be shot, ghuls usually have problems bypassing reasonable DV (at least approaching thirties). Amulet of free action should never leave ones backpack and gaining intrinsic paralysis resistance is very valuable. Luckily the only thing able to paralyse in distance is your character with wand of paralysation in hands (remember paralysing ray bounces).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Death ray is instant kill if character has not resistance. Even if resisted it might deal a ton of damage. From non-uniques only kirins and emperor liches have this dark power. Kirins luckily are rare and emperor liches. Well, my advice is to avoid them if possible. And don’t forget that stupid ancient wrapping has death protection installed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As dopleganger kings go… wand of fireballs, offensive alchemy or crystals of fire loaded into sling makes they lifespan short. Don’t fight these in melee, keep distance and defensive tactics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Battle tactics&lt;br /&gt;Late in game I usually find myself spending most time either in very aggressive or berserk. Early on… depends on situation. Two things two remember – true berserking very early on (I would remove these clothes from drakeling assassin immediately as that allows to reach true berserking in one turn) and running away at coward on low hit points. As manual states that gives you discount on run away movement if your hit points are one third or lower.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7. Assasin skills:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt; Alchemy:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As manual says: Alchemy allows you to brew magical potions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;To use this skill, you need to collect the ingredients required to mix magical potions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It would also be useful to have the recipe for a potion at hand.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;You can’t brew anything without recipe except big “boom”. Luckily you get one recipe per 10 points of skill. As assassin you always start at exact ten points and first one… is of course trustful poison. At 100 you will gain recipe for gain attributes potion. It might be something like “youth and longevity” or&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“strength and cure corruption”. Still skill is very good and should be developed early on.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Some other recipes should be good. My favourite is potion of blindness denying fair fight than you feel yourself in trouble. But cheap recipe for extrahealing or making booze out of burb roots and carrot juice can ease your life quite a lot.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Notice: recipe for potion of blindness will include two non-repetitive ingredients from these (two herbs per recipe is not possible) – potions of booze, water, carrot juice, burb root, pepper petal, daemon daisy. This one can’t be bad.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Offensive alchemy: if you are wearing ToEF gear (fire immunity/quadruple fire resistance and ring of ice/all vulnerable stuff behind fireproof blanket) explosions from failed mixtures will not harm you and blast surrounding creatures away. Don’t forget you can mix two herbs, giving your assassin virtually unlimited fireballing power.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Also in my opinion power of fireballs decreases as your Alchemy skill raises and increases as your Willpower goes up.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.2 Alertness:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Good one. Non wishable. Lets you dodge combat magic (bolts including death ray), makes detect traps more effective.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Provides some DV bonuses (manual states +4 at skill level 100).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is rumoured that Alchemy combined with high Alertness gives even higher DV bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Notice: that is one of skills, which is significantly better at 80 and 100, making double or even triple check in your favour.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.3: Archery&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At 100 that gives Assassin +5 to hit and + 2 to damage.&lt;br /&gt;At 60 opens up Lightning shot (very good talent extra –10% for missile weapon energy).&lt;br /&gt;At 80 – Eagle Eyed (good one +3to-hit, +3 to-damage).&lt;br /&gt;Allows shooting in red zone on passed check (basically out of reach without archery).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.4: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Backstabbing:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Manual: This skill increases your chance to hit and your chance to score a critical hit when you attack friendly or neutral monsters (or on hostile monsters if they don't notice you)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="" lang="EN-GB"&gt;.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt; stress on not noticing part. With invisibility and assassin powers that is very nice. Also 80/100 type skill.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.5 Climbing&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Good for climbing… actually falling into rift. Grants access to library and potentially some SoCR along with some spellbooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.6 Detect Traps&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Helps a lot in… detecting traps. There couple of heavily trapped areas in game. Also sometimes kicks in automatically, gets bonus from alertness, helps to avoid known traps (just when you try step over that stone block trap…)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.7 Dodge:&lt;br /&gt;Boost to DV. Double boost after lv32. I’ve heard 20points of DV is awesome. Dodge is somewhat hard to train in late game so start pumping it early on.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.8 Find Weakness:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Awesome. Boosts up chance of criticals. Self trains at some point as skills give you criticals and criticals train skill. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.9 First Aid&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I have mixed feelings upon this one. Early on it is good, but at that time skill is usually low. Later on you should get Healing. With good Healing First Aid becomes less interesting. Once you get enough antidotes and poison resistance you can forget about it. In general very good in case character gets poisoned. Should be used early on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.10 Haggling&lt;br /&gt;You can apply this skill on a shopkeeper. But don’t blame anyone if prices go up. The only time I would ever use it is early on and being desperate to buy something, which can save my ass. I would give up after first increase. Don’t put your skillpoints here. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.11 Listening&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Affects some game messages – from traps triggered by monsters, tension rooms, hearing roars while killing cats and so on… Not useless, but usually doesn’t need rises. Trains itself for good at arena.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.12 Literacy &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Granted if Learning 10 or more, for grey/high elves. Grants ability to read scrolls, if planning to read some spellbooks put skillpoints here. Trainable with rereading certain scrolls (ratling pamphlets).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.13 Pick Locks&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Sort of usable, especially for locking doors. Keep in mind picking usually triggers in traps. Cursed locked picks are rumoured to have nasty effects (trap creation?). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.14 Stealth&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Good with backstabbing, good at library for keeping librarian happy. Rumoured to be neutralised by source of light. According manual:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="" lang="EN-GB"&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;is extremely helpful in ambushing monsters in the wilderness”. If so should increase chance of avoiding fight on wilderness encounters (uber jackals).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;5.15 Two weapon combat&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;This guide heavily advices to use one weapon combat at all cases.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6. Racial skills:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.1 Athletics:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Very good as gives both stat increases and speed. Very bad this is a troll skill.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.2 Bridge Building:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Another troll skill. Good for making bridges, requires hatchet, manual and logs. Most players prefer making ice bridges, teleport traps instead.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;One of methods to cross lake with chaos piranhas.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.3 Cooking&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Hurthling’s skill - considered being good. In my opinion skill is pretty useless, unless used to preserve something like displacer beast corpses. First, skill can ruin precious corpses (orb guardians and a like). Secondary if you want cooking it, you can always do it with offensive alchemy. Or simply keep corpses blessed with holy water.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Requires cooking set.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.4 Food preservation&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Skill of humans, hurthlings, trolls and drakelings. Very good. Helps in corpse preservation (also works on raw meat, melons, apples), also at higher levels is rumoured to increase chances of monsters dropping corpse. Since this means more stat increasing, intrinsic giving corpses…&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As training goes I suggest keeping low weighted corpses in inventory and buying some apples at Terinyo (these comes for around 5gp a piece).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.5 Gardening&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Hurtlings racial skill. Can be used on herb seeds to create herbs. Of course you can use holy water for same effect, but…&lt;br /&gt;If you create herb bush with seed on level which doesn’t support herbs it is… it becomes herb supporting. Any level - Infinite Dungeon (report on google groups), Dwarftown (personal testing). Under certain circumstances this can be very very useful.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Notice: herbs do appear on sale in Terinyo shop&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.6 Gemmology&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Skill given to trolls and gnomes. Lets to identify gems on pick up, grants some gems if walls are dug up with pickaxe or by monsters.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;At high end (100) output of gems is huge. Well, at least enough to cover pickaxe fixing costs for dwarf friendly races, especially if pickaxe is corroded.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Can be exploited to gain a lot - crystals of power, learning, health, fire, light, darkness.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Keep in mind fire crystals act as spell of improved fireball, darkness gives… darkness and a chance making some fights one sided (as certain monsters do not fight in darkness). Crystals of learning can permanently increase characters learning if used in blessed status.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.7 Metallurgy&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Skill for orcs and dwarves. Considered to be one of most useless. Can identify ingots on pickup.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.8 Mining&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Skill of dwarves, orcs and gnomes. Decreases time of mining, helps to preserve pickaxes. Not a thing I would ever miss.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.9 Music&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Skill granted for drakelings. You need to put some work in that skill before it is starts working. If you do so you could tame some animals. Potentially this could be useful early on to deal with cats. Unluckily early on skill is way too low.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;And you can always keep a tamed dog (give him some bones) somewhere in dungeon.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.10 Pick Pockets&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Nice skill of gnomes. Gets extra stuff from their pockets into your pockets. Stuff under 10stones.

Very good one. Very… boring one. Let’s start. You need hammer (easy), anvil (complicated), forge (depends on random luck) and some ingots/ore.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;With all in place you can increase your weapons and armour quality. If you pass skill check…&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Let’s start again. Probably easiest to obtain forge is in drwarftown (potentially corruption free area). You need to get stupid dwarven smith out of forgery (which becomes decent storage place). Technically easiest ways are either to teleport him out, or wait until he stands in door way and switch positions (:s) with him. Next take him out of level, cause he will sense you using his forge and claim for money.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Once he is out of level you might kill dwarven smith for anvil. But than you will not get pickaxe fixes. And smithing needs ore. And ore needs mining (you can use a couple of your pets giant racoons tamed by music, but I prefer pickaxe). And no you can’t fix pickaxe via smithing. Glod can. You not - even if being dwarven weaponsmith. You can kill dwarven artificer in Darkforge, but that is very deadly fight. It is wiser first to mine ore, then to kill dwarven smith.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;No you can start melting ore and getting smithing up. (Removing rust also trains skill and is slightly faster in game.). Once you done, you can start smithing up your gear.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Notice: with some patience gear can be smithed seriously up to a point of giving positive DV to … a phase daggers.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.12 Swimming&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Humans and drakelings are good in this. Somewhat useful early on. Don’t forget you may use blessed ring of fish to cross water safely. Unluckily that ring is autocursing, so that means one potion of holy water each time you put it on. There is also guaranteed means of waterbreathing on lowest level of rift.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As far as my understanding goes this skill doesn’t help against water breathing attacks.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6.13 Ventriloquism&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Another gnomish skill. Very useful if trained. Allows to confuse monsters for couple of turns. Confusion duration is stackabale. So 15 passed applies in a row should leave monster confused for 20+ turns. Drawback is obvious you need to be next to monster while applying it.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.

Manual and hatchet is gotten after dispatching carpenter (killing or healing). You won’t get manual if carpenter is sacrificed on altar. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Carpenter (if saved) can be used to train this skill. Fastest way is too feed extra hatchets to carpenter in Terinyo.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Check 6.2.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.2 Courage&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Taught by old barbarian after completing his quest. Very good. Surprisingly assassins receive penalties even when fighting two opponents at a time. Gives minor help in rift climbing.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.3 Disarm traps&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Taught to thieves’ guild members.

Personally I do not find myself using it very often.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.4 Gardening&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unlikely reward for black druid’s quest. This guide heavily advices to take carpenter quest and get healing installed on your character.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.5 Healing&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unless you are Candle born or Troll go for this (take carpenter’s quest) early on. In many cases I’d recommend getting healing chaotic way. Stat drain won’t hinder assassin much and you get decent skill value. Healer is your first target for quest based assassination. He is not tough, just regenerates extremely fast. One toss of dagger on berserk should do the job. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;You might want to heal carpenter0 first and use some of Jharod’s healing first.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.6&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Herbalism&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Likely reward for black druid’s quest. This guide heavily advices to take carpenter quest and get healing installed on your character.&lt;br /&gt;Herbalism would allow you to pick herbs faster, identify them on pick up and to know bush status. As far as identify goes… you vcan spare one scroll if having enough herb samples, keep calculating herbal lines or if you have enough herbs identify on taste (in such case curaria won’t be Id before devil’s rose and cursed curaria fails to cure sickness from time to time so having some food and blessed potion of healiong is recommended).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Faster pick up… saves real-life time, of course. Avoiding restarting characters due to their deaths does the same. I need hit point recovering earlier than herbs.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Bush status. I usually have a pilot square, in which one bush is picked off each time.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Overall – Candle borns might have an idea of getting herbalism, but… Black druid is somewhat dangerous and shouldn’t be rushed into. Which means I get to herbs faster than I would get Herbalism. And healing can be installed chaotic way very early on. Choose life, choose healing… /end of agitation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;7.7 Law&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Taught by sheriff after completing both his quests.

Later on switch for orcish spear to gain some DV.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Later on as you get DV from Dodge/Alertness, smithing any decent weapon you find.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Decent weapons:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Kickass artifact (emerald dager, executor, skullcrusher, probably kinslayer, minotaur axe) = higher metal weapon of penetration (weapon class doesn’t matter)&gt;higher metal weapon with huge damage output (eternium of devastation, stops dreaming here)= non higher metal of pentration (phase dagers including).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;First thing - before I invest skill marks I want to make sure my weapon doesn’t dissolve in acid trap or by fire lizard’s breath. After that I want to go around PV with my assassin’s criticals. If I can’t get around I want to smash that thing with something big. Simple logic.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As slaying artefacts versus weapons of penetration go… Slayers guarantee critical hits and assassins are quite capable doing more damage than monsters PV. On other hand they have good chance for criticals anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;After getting Dodge bonus doubled (lv32) I might consider giving away shield. Good guaranteed alternative is rune-covered trident. It gives DV through Dexterity boost and is polearm…&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;And I do not like basher for Assassins… mainly from roleplay reasons. C’mmon they are not someone running with big weapon and a battle roar… &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Weapon class evaluation:&lt;br /&gt;a) Unarmed fighting&lt;br /&gt;Rating: assassin without weapon? Go ant steal a dagger from some goblins.&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: Brass knuckles preferably combined with corrupted thorns on your hands. (doable, I know)&lt;br /&gt;b) Daggers and Knives&lt;br /&gt;Rating: depends on weapon, probably you will start with this, gets some style points&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: dagger of death, phase dagger, Emerald Bite, Needle and Sting (almost never used them), smithed ego dagers and orcish knives (penetration, devastation). If obsessed with daggers you can try knives of endurance or bloody orcish daggers. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;You’ll probably have lv 6 (including later bonus from gladiator) in daggers before you upgrade your starting weapon. Leave marks there they are until and if you see any worth weapon. Don’t forget crowning gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding twins: by the time you have them there is very little game left.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Yes, they are stylish, but if we speak about duel wielding I’d prefer two phase daggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Clubs and Hammers&lt;br /&gt;Rating: low, you see that artifact listed bellow, you go for this. If no… well assassin looks better bare handed in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons:&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Skullcrusher, ego stuff (penetration)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Maces and Flails&lt;br /&gt;Rating: awful, unstylish, unspectacular, uninteresting…&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Good weapons: ego weapon (penetration)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Swords&lt;br /&gt;Rating: low&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: sword of sharpness (people tend to love it), ego weapons, Kinslayer(?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to try Kinslayer one day. As sword of sharpness goes… I do remember old saying “if you haven’t got better weapon before ToEF, you might as well reroll the character.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;If you have a character with Kinslayer let me know about it, okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Axes&lt;br /&gt;Rating: low&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: Executor, ego weapons&lt;br /&gt;You get executor or mithril axe of penetration you go in this class.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Possible crowning gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Whips&lt;br /&gt;Rating: in style points? I like them. Practically? You are kidding???&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: whip of the snake, penetration weaponry&lt;br /&gt;Whips of the snake --- let me think. One per wish, no slaying powers, no resistance to fire, acid. So you take your assassin with dual wielded whips of snakes into blue dragon caves? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I did once. Had to finish game like tree loving pacifist, teleporting most guys out of my way on D50 with well boozed wand. Never again.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Pole arms&lt;br /&gt;Rating: awesome&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: ego weapons (milking down orcish scorchers), Wyrmlance (more backup weapon), rune-covered trident, Trident of the Red Rooster&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;You should find some good orcish spear while milking scorchers, hill orcs and alike.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Spear traps do not give ego weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Two-handed weapons&lt;br /&gt;Rating: unstylish but powerful&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: ego weapons, axe of the minotaur emperor, Death’s Blade (?)&lt;br /&gt;Okay, Cow Axe is guaranteed. Just if going for two-handed weapons I prefer rune-covered trident.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Choose this if you playing troll. Don’t play trolls as assassins.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Staves&lt;br /&gt;Rating: questionable&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: ego weapons, quicksilver quarterstaff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiksilver is decent for an archer, but for assassin… damage output 6d3+5. I still prefer rune-covered trident.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Missile weapons&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;We assassins are not foolish enough to go bashing every mob, are we?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;You start with thrown daggers (okay, hurtlings might go with boomerang). I’d keep them and orcish knives. Making two stacks at very least. You see if a heap of daggers rusts they rust all. And they unrust by one a piece.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I wouldn’t hurry into short bows as it is unwise to get stuck with cursed one. So you move to arrows/quarrels after finding altar or at least having good heap of stackable bows (supposed to be uncursed ones).&lt;br /&gt;Don’t forget slaying ammunition. Assassin with “Farslayer” loading in quarrels of humanoid slaying is very nice picture for me. Don’t forget all these missiles of thunder, darkness, as they might be very useful to stop someone chasing you.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Except of bows and crossbows I wouldn’t waste time on anything else.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I suppose crossbow will be your third missile weapon to train, but it is worth that.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;There are rare daemon slaying sling bullets, but I would leave slings away, even if playing hurtling. Assassins are not archers. Bow and crossbow is more than enough.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;May be a bit of thrown spears. But again you better smash them with that trident.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Armour&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Nothing new. Get your PV fixed early and keep working on DV.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Somewhere mid game you should choose which way DV or PV to go. Stylewise DV look better, but 100/20 or 20/100 is both good. Believe me even 60/60 does quite well. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Remember Darkforge is famous for armour room and smithing is good way to improve stuff. Alternatively you can keep buying off scroll shop. Normally scrolls should be used on non smithable parts of your inventory (seven league boots being prime example).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;a) Rings&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As put on and see result tactics go… I would say no at least until you find altar. Skipping rare stuff (like weakness and doom) worst thing is cursed ring of damage. So it is advisable to check rings via left finger if needed. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Early on: anything you can get. Speed, blessed ring of damage (right finger), mental stability are nice.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Mid to late: ring of the High Kings, probably ring of slaying, keeping in backpack blessed ring of ice, rings of invisibility, regeneration, mental stability/clear mind.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Dream stuff: ring of master cat and ring of immunity.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Amulets&lt;br /&gt;This time I would say yes to put identify tactics. The only harmful thing is amulet of hunger and these are AoLS rarity level. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Early on: anything you get, hopefully not cursed one, remember glass amulet gives light.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Mid to late: ankh, but in reality I found myself wearing something to affect my alignment most of time. If you like being chaotic you can throw away that marble piece called amulet of order. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Backpack: petrification, death resistances, free action, balance. Stashed away some willpower, mana, appearance boosting amulets, water breathing (if you have one).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Dreams: Preserver. Renereation+luck+paralysis restriction...&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Blessed amulets of life saving. Good choice if you have doubts of battle outcome.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Helmets&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Early: metal cap, orcish helmet, bone helmet or anything getting good price in shop before big identify.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Mid to late: Smithed higher metal gear, smithed crowns of lightning, regeneration.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Backpack: helm of mental stability (confusion resistance).&lt;br /&gt;Dreams: Crown of leadership , very well smithed gear from above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Girdles&lt;br /&gt;Early: metal girdle, girdle of carrying, strength.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Mid to late: Smithed high metal, enhanced girdle of giant strength&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Dreams: platinum girdle – not really an option, waterproof girdle of giant strength [+6, +6] {St+15}- requires ring of ice to function proper. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;If wishing I’d rather choose ring of weakness not GoGS. Nope I am not on drugs. Ring lowers strength so you can abuse things like ogre armies or mined out stone giants to get lots of natural strength. This doesn’t burn away easily.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Cloaks&lt;br /&gt;Early: hooded cloak unless you run in any 30stone or 20stone non-light cloak.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Mid to late: any scroll-enhanced cloak, cloaks of protection, defence. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Backpack: cloak of invisibility (good but refuses to hide behind gauntlets)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Dreams: very enhanced cloak of appearance. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Bracers&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Early on: anything you find.

There a few of ways to do so: potions of confusion, blindness (obtainable via Alchemy), cursed potions of invisibility (cheap option), wand/spell of stunning.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to throw potion with sling. Putting potion in missile slot ant WHEN putting sling in missile weapon slot. That doesn’t give extra range, unless… You have knowledge in slings. Lv3 in skills giving extra range is applied to potions on top once this is happening other bonuses like archery suddenly are applicable too. Slings of long shot do not seem to have any advantages in such case.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;"&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;c)&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Webbing – similar to a) except monster can break webs and that moment is not possible to prognose. It is possibly better not to shoot wands directly at monster but lead it into webbed area. Webs are susceptible to fire and acid.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;"&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;d)&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Entrance denial – using locked doors, walls and area spells/offensive alchemy. Alternatively if you are fighting emperor lich and way is blocked by fire lizards you can use offensive alchemy while fire lizards serve as living wall.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-left: 18pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Using poison on bosses usually is clever idea. Although I doubt that you can arrange acute blood poisoning (severe loss of hit points due to multiple poisoning hits) for monsters that is still helpful. You can try potions of sickness, as they should lower opponents hitpoints in general. That might not work on high level stuff.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Particular monsters:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;1. Kranach&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Depends on what gear you managed to get so far. If you got yourself to lv5 in small cave with no loot…basically all you need is too land a couple of poisoned daggers on him and run a couple circles around on coward. That suggests you have speed above 100 and probably long stride.&lt;br /&gt;If not… Try taking some raiders down with thrown daggers and bash some away with berserk tactics. Last thing you need is getting surrounded. Remember these starting prayers.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Good news are that gang leaves load of arrows and sometimes long bow. And some cashable corpses. Any combat wands or drakelings acid breath makes job lot easier.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Kranach itself is quite dangerous. Possibly in distance more than in close combat. Keeping his arrow path obstructed with some random mobs might be a good idea.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Raider lord is wishable.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keethrax&lt;br /&gt;You were told not to do so, but… it is Assassin’s guide. It’s probably earliest time you meet stat drainer (apart from undead who need at least to push some hits in). So melee is not recommended. He casts darkness so light source is essential. Guidebook has two statements on him “immune to elemental attacks”(monster section) and “He is vulnerable to acid, webs and magic missiles, but little else in the way of magic” (section about Terinyo). As my memories tell me second one is correct.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Should be shot in general. In raged combat can shoot sling bullets and cast magic missile so having good skill in missiles and some healing potions is recommended. In my opinion should be done later, while revisiting initial area.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;3. Jharod, the healer&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Except for good regeneration complete pushover. Use Berserk tactics, to avoid alignment drop you might try aiming behind him. If so shoot first at coward as killing him hostile is more preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Hotzenplotz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melee is not bright idea, as he has high damage him. So check his speed before fight starts. Shoot him or zap with wands. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;If needed run away to wilderness. Just realize where you will get when you will return and try to exit somewhere far away. Yet another place to use poisoned ammunition. I wouldn’t be overexcited to melee Grunge and Munge either. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Luckily he is not hostile before attacking and will patiently wait until you feel ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Rehetep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully you already started smithing and done herb farming. I suggest drinking blessed potion of invisibility before going up. Mummies will see you, but most of random buggers hopefully no.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Brute force will get job done, especially with blessed weapon. Wand of fireballs from Thrundarr is good. Offensive alchemy, if you can secure yourself and equipment, can do wonders. I’d try to save undead slaying ammo for later. Remember you do not need to finish that gorgon without petrification resistance. Kill Rehetep, get his artefacts, and descend. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Nonnak and Griff&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Well, bless you weapon before going into here. Upper portion of graveyard is simple mindless bashing with some movement to avoid being surrounded.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Lower part - use detect traps skill. Take invisibility potion near final chamber. Area based fire attacks (wand of fireballs, crystals of fire, offensive alchemy) again do wonders here.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As Griff goes it is usually possible to sneak on his grave and pour some water. Or you can teleport behind him. Alternatively use blessed undead slaying ammo. Brute force is not wisiest idea.&lt;br /&gt;For Nonnak I would recommend cold resistance (preferably double – rings, white dragon gauntlets, amulet of cold heart) or AMW. Take him down with fire. After he is off retreat to tunnel, finish off summoned mobs. (removing items of invisibility is advisable here).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Get artefacts, go up (it is usually teleport trap under elemental gauntlets so take shortcut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;6. Grave robbing&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Some guys unluckily died before assassin got chance to slay and loot them. Luckily they left their graves.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Regular graves do not give any problems, but “Greater treasure” ones are dangerous. Mainly because they spawn Liches, including Emperors and Kings. Advice?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Be ready for that. First you need death resistance and a few hundred hit points in case of getting hit with death ray. Invisibilty is also helpful since all Liches are summoning bastards and most of they summons don’t see invisible. Paralysation resistance wouldn’t hurt, but I guess your neck will be occupied with amulet of balance. Since I wouldn’t advice take Emperor or King in melee confusion resistance might appear useful.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Dig grave via wand, as you won’t need to climb out of it. Because you usually get first move, you can step away and do that should be done. That means either taking your target with blessed undead slaying ammo or using fire based area attack or simply running for your life.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I would keep something like scroll of teleportation readied in case of emergency escape.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.Arena&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;There are two main problems here (except for 20+fights) cats and possible meeting with Li-Hon-Kay.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As cats goes teleport trap (or wand, or spell), corruption trap, potion of exchange (even cursed) or potion of raw chaos are good. Alternatively you might generate pet/companion inside arena (scroll of familiar summoning) use it to dispose cats, level it up a bit on your opponents. Pet should give you some extra breathing room while facing famous Ogre Magi.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Li-Hon-Kay - each time you are doing 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; fight, you should be prepared to meet him. Ancient mummy wraping makes fight very favourable. If you choosed to fight before be at be at least cold resistant, take some healing with you (blessed spenseweed is probably best). You can locate him by trying to name empty squares. If you get someone already has name type of message, well, you found him.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;8. Snake from Beyond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should remember advices above. Use invisibility, use fire based attacks (boozed wand of fireballs, crystals of fire, offensive alchemy) on all those water grues, daemons. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Take care of chaos servants as they see invisible. You might shoot them using water barrier. Dig up inner temple, removing third column with (blessed) wand of digging. Wake up Snake with something like wand of far slaying for 1 if necessary. Put her on your chase and isolate from all these daemons and grues.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Shoot her, zap her. If in corridor leading to temple using arrows of darkness, thunder is not a bad idea. If you are lucky with recipes you might spare some potions of blindness or curse some potions of invisibility.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Locked doors and wand of fireballs won’t work (I somehow doubt you have enough Willpower anyway, but..), that stupid snake can smash doors&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Overall that is not so difficult fight. Snake has not ranged attack, spells. If you have problems outrunning her, lead Snake out of level and use teleportation. All regular tricks (poisoning your arrows, enhancing your speed, paralysing or stunning her with wands) are welcomed. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;And don’t forget to pick up corpse and deliver it to druid.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Skeletal King&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Remember ice limit is 2000 stones.&lt;br /&gt;Also the door is trapped. In most cases Skeletal King will trigger trap, but if not… Well, apply Detect Traps on that door.&lt;br /&gt;Confusion resistance is essential, unless you like applying climbing or clearing ears for half eternity (these actions would simple consume turns, keeping your confused feet away from piranhas). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Fire attacks before leaving ice bridge are not recommended. Blessed undead slaying ammo does miracles, but might be hard to retrieve from lake.&lt;br /&gt;Rmemeber ring is not in skeleton’s pocket. You can always toss potion of blindness at Skeletal King while he is out of building and off the bridge and when run, get ring and leave. Very unstylish, but healthy.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;10. Kherab, the Dwarven Artificer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;The only reason to fight him is anvil. Guy is tough… High hit points, high PV, immune to fire (and Alchemy), 3 attacks per round each being in eighties (non critical), fast regeneration.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Best way to kill him is using humanoid slaying ammo while standing at some pool. Luckily you have a square, which is blocked off by water. If taken in melee should be blinded/paralysed. In such case ever use weapon bypassing PV or something with exceptional damage output. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Kherab regularly drops heavy crossbow but never uses it. Fights in darkness. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Ancient Chaos Wyrm&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;To tackle tower at first place you need good fire resistance. As wyrm goes shock resistance is advised (preferably char should be intrinsic resistant to fire and shock, wearing elemental gauntlets and ring of the High Kings). Confusion resistance is very important (preferably helm of mental stability leaving one finger for ring of ice) since Wyrm loves to confuse his pray.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Invisibility (I guess via potion) is nice as allows to dodge some elementals, daemons and grue. After you dig in the temple, take off chaos servants, who see invisible, and make Wyrm follow you into corridor. It is advised not to stay in straight line with wyrm to avoid unnecessary blasts.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Once out of temple you can blast him with wands stopping his advance by a buffer of fire daemons, who seems to dodge more bolts than Wyrm. Alternatively you should pralyze/blind/stun/confuse him. Ideally you should finish him off with dragon slaying ammo but these are rare at that point of game, so direct bashing is probably unavoidable.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As Wyrm is immune to fire and can smash doors offensive alchemy is out of use here.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;A healing set should include at least few blessed major healing potions and good piety.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;12. Bunny master&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;The guy itself is not a problem, bunnies are. Took him off as soon as possible. If bunnies get out of control… offensive alchemy and boosted willpower should get the job done.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;13. Cat Lord&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Preferably you should avoid this fight as ring of master cat is very good. At very least keeping number of killed cats low is wise.&lt;br /&gt;First put on means of seeing invisible. Second… you may start webbing extra space right away leaving yourself path to retreat. Taking cat lord out of level is wise at least, as this allows instant escape via teleportation.&lt;br /&gt;The cat lord also is very fast and hits hard, depending on how many cats you killed. Standard methods of immobilization works nicely as humanoid slaying ammo do. If you are short on these there is a big casino shop few levels above, which does restock.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;14. Kherab’s quests&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;There is no real reason to do them. But for assassin temptation is high…&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;14.1 Guth’Alak&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;First problem is not making slaughterhouse of the village. Best way is to turn druid hostile without attacking or pickpocketing him.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Probably best is to zap wand of stunning or paralyzation at him. If you miss you got the job done. If yes wait until effect wears off.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Druid has under 100 hitpoints, is immune to fire, ice, shock and can cast confusion and magic missile. Either bash him down or zap with wand of acid.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;14.2 Thrundarr&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;If you don’t want to fight against dwarftown you will need to turn him hostile (same as above) and take out of level, as killing dwarfs in dwarftown is not bright idea.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Elder itself is low on hitpoints and not best fighter in the world, except… high PV, expect 100+. Phase daggers or weapons of penetration take him off quickly. Humanoid slaying ammo and direct bashing might be ineffective as criticals do not by pass PV.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15. Yulgash, the Master Summoner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy itself is not big problem. Place itself is nasty and summons… I’ve seen Emperor Liches there, so you better don’t give him extra time.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;The place is crackling with electricity and shock bolts from air elementals are not very helpful. Since item destruction is very possible things like seven league boots and girdle of giant strength is probably not coming in. Most of your carried stuff should be left outside (probably out of level). You should carry necessary things, back up copies of necessary things, indestructible materials and total crap to feed RNG.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Outside is not a big problem especially with invisibility. I wouldn’t clear all the monsters in outer ring as that may trigger new monster generation and since depth is reasonable… you don’t want extra dopleganger king in this fight, do you?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As inner temple goes… First you should be invisible. Second you must stop Yulgash from summoning as soon as possible. Well, repeatedly zapping wand of stunning/paralyzation with boosted Willpower as soon as secret doors open is bright idea, but… In most cases some stupid vapor rat stumbles on fireball traps in fornt of temple and that usually wakes up. Practically that means once you go through secret door a couple summoning rounds are already done and monsters do not stand on default positions. Good part is you probably can navigate your way to Summoner via easier monsters. Get him immobilized and go berserk. Do to trap nonsense I wouldn’t step on altar ever in my characters life.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16. Ancient Stone Beast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news – our trustful invisibility is not useful here as most monsters see invisible. All these elementals and grues pass walls. All these have high hit points, high PV. Elementals do regenerate. Have I already said I hate this place? Weapons of penetration, phase daggers really shine here. But my personal prefernce is offensive alchemy. Just take good heap of herbs, boost willpower and let them surround you (very easy in here). And start making failures in Alchemy. As said in skills department you need quadruple fire resistance and some means to save your inventory.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Of course you can take Elementals out of level in small groups and slash with sword of sharpness. If that is your style…/end of irony.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Once you reach Stone Beast (luckily in most cases it comes toward you) there are more bad news. The only slaying ammo, which works here are generic slaying and penetration. Construct slaying ammo does nothing extra than a simple arrow. PV is around 60 and bastard is regenerating. Of course you can keep yourself in coward and keep producing herbal blasts.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Since this is not spellcasting boss without high speed, immobilizing it is nice but not really necessary.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17. Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Once again you need to fight your way to a bastard holding orb. Bad part sneak attack is not an option as chaos wizards and their summons see invisible. What? I haven’t told you got 18 nasty summoners behind initial forces. Oh, sorry…&lt;br /&gt;Before you start smashing poor chaos folk check your inventory. Confusion resistance is absolutely necessary as Archmage is very capable of confusing your char and tham draining your precious stats. I would recommend double confusion resistance (helm and ring of mental stability for example. Single source even with high willpower might be not enough. You can ask gods to clear your head, but that shouldn’t be done too often. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Death resistance is necessary as toying with instant kill is not funny. Doubling it (let’s say AMW+bracers of resistance) reduces hit point loss, but with high DV and Alertness you might skip second source.&lt;br /&gt;Light is highly recommended. Archmage will periodically cast darkness. You can keep recasting light (if mage hating eyes are gone) or zapping wands of light, but this way might be painful.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;As secret door opens up mana temple Assassin must make choice. You can either fight at doorway or go inside with blasting rage.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Doorway chop method: well basics are simple, you stand in corridor and fight one guy per time. Lure Archmage out of temple into trapped way around it, immobilize and tear him away. Fighting without immobilization is not recommended as he is stat drainer and due to high efficiency confusion attacks archery is not very safe. He is susceptible to humanoid slaying ammo.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Some things to make job faster:&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;as you open temple you might want to wake up Artchmage with wand of far slaying for 1. Aim it west (unluckily that also wakes chaos wizards behind him). And if you have straight line at chaos wizards zap any offensive wand. Once summoners are gone the job will go faster.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Maniacal instructions for herbal attack: basic is simple and opposite to first method. Get your Willpower high, sneak as deep in temple as you can and start herbal Alchemy (take care of your resistances and stuff). Potions of boost willpower are awesome. Archmage itself is immune to fire so you will need to deal with him same way as described above.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;I would recommend herbal attack.

Remaining ancient dragons and wyrms should not be a big problem for high level char, just ne highly resistant to shock and do not stand at dead end with three dragons breathing lightning with rebounces at you.&lt;br /&gt;As you enter lv5 of caves detect where archenemy is and start clearing your way in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;Srraxxarrakex itself can be shot with dragon slaying ammo. Since that is rare thing you might want to keep dragon slayers on stairs to blue dragon caves and make extra trip to get them. Stair to stair teleportation is preferable method of travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Immobilizing wyrm is good idea as this at least stops him from healing spells. IF you are planning to melee him take some major healing potions with you as guy has three attacks per round and can score some criticals on you.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;   &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;18.2 Sharad-Waador&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;There is no need to kill him, but if you got some dragon slaying left from visiting blue dragon caves… it is not bad investment in terms of loot and experience.&lt;br /&gt;Should be shot, as melee vs. karmic creature is not recommended.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;   &lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;18.3 Filk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully he is not very deep. Killing him is not a problem, getting a touch on him… He is listed as karmic anyway. Area spells from wand of fireballs to herbal blast will get job done in no time.&lt;br /&gt;If you miss him in ID, he is probably possible to catch via random encounter.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;   &lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;18.4 Emperor moloch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extreme PV to a point you get messages of criticals not getting through. Weapon of penetration, phase daggers are of great use. Should be dealt with fast as area is heavily corrupting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;   &lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;18.5 Keriax, the multi-headed chaos dragon&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;   &lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Should me immobilized on first opportunity. Wyrm is capable of confusion, poisoning, stat draining and dangerous bolts containing ranged corruptions attacks.&lt;br /&gt;Wisest is to teleport into the circle throw a potion of blindness, confusion, cursed invisibility and take him off with dragon slayers.&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat, do whatever you like – paralyze, stun, blind him – but don’t be helpless target for his bolts. They do high damage and are highly corrupting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.6 ElDeR cHaOs GoD (Andor Drakon)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;He is invisible, able to cast death ray, stat drain, paralyse (last two if you stand next to him), summons purple jellies, likes casting darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Some immobilization methods(stun, blinding, confusion) are not recommended as Andy has teleportitis (or atunment to astral planes) and you better hope he can control his localisation as chasing his random teleports all over chaos plane are not funny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Teleport away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;If you want to be a dragon slayer… I told you she doesn’t fight back in darkness unless scared and cornered. So get next to her switch to high damage gear (probably go for natural berserker bonuses) get darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;You might want to zap couple wands of poison/paralyzation. Probably you miss, but if not… Remember she regenerates and has good PV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;If she panicks… leave the cave. Chasing is too dangerous. Well, you cab try getting her back by picking item getting her teleport next to you and putting some dragon sklaying arrows in her big green spine, but don’t blame me if you get washed for 300hp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;20. D50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I can’t say much more than it is written in guidebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Sometimes side corridors with levels are undigable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;In general you should remember your goal is to close gate (pull levers and asure they remain closed – preferably by destructing them with that wand) or to gate through chaos gate. Assassin’s are not made to fight with crowds stylewise. Gamewise offensive alchemy is crowd control, but that is not intentional feature in my opinion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Pacifistic walkthrough for d50: get in one side corridor with well charged wand of teleportation, boost speed, teleport anything out of you way to lever, teleport stuff around that. Step back luring balor from the lever, teleport on lever, pull it and destroy. Repeat with other one. Teleport on stairs and exit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;If you plan making big fight… Well, clean both side branches. Pull both levers, wait a bit. You will get special message as one of balors teleports on lever (usually top one, which possibly must be out of sight line). Kill balor. Pull lever, wait for another one, this way you can take 7 balors around big one easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;VI. Assassin’s and spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;This section will assume your assassin hasn’t got Concentration. Because if it has… you have all spells at your disposal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Game manual has great section on spells, so check it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Keep in mind increasing spell effectiveness reduces need in power points. Bookcasting talents are great if you are planning to cast from books… I wouldn’t, but that’s again me. Do not forget bookcasting does not increases spell power, but doesn’t use up either spell memory or spellbook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Bookcasting usually costs triple power points in Adom 1.1.1 (I recall somewhere in game it states 4xPP, but that is wrong). It also takes 3000 energy points, luckily they are calculated after you get spell. So if you bookcast Teleportation you get to safe place and when you spend time watching at mobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Basically assassin’s look at spells is to get some assistance if things get tight. Oh, yes, bookcasting includes reading so… it is good way to train Literacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;No surprise if things get tight your spell number one is Teleportation (should cost around 20pp on regular days). Absolutely awesome if combined with teleport control. Gets you in or gets you out as far as level have no special restrictions. You can get guaranteed spellbook my saving Khelevaster, but there is also guaranteed wand of teleportation on hidden stairs to Assassin guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Darkness – quite a bunch of monsters do not fight in darkness. Very cheap and relatively easy to learn, can be replaced by scrolls and crystals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Strength of Atlas – it can kill you by timing out, but overall decent spell taking care of your carrying capacity. The one which should be bookcasted and possibly kept casted all the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Light – easiest to learn. Eases some issues with dark rooms. As cheapest spell,l light probably can be used via bookcasting to train Literacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Healing spells – doesn’t hurt but without Concentration I would not rely on them to much, herb farming is probably better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Knock – by the time you get book and learning in place you should have a collection of keys anyways. As training perception goes… carrot juice is plentiful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Stun ray – with some efficiency and high willpower can be very useful. Is relatively easy to learn, so if you can bless the book and read it. Helps to make battles one-sided. I like this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Minor attack spell – you might want one or two in case you do not want or cannot attack in melee or shoot. Probably magic missile or/and burning hands. Both get better with some efficiency and willpower. MM cannot be resisted and burning hands nearly always hits the target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Ball spells – way to hard to learn without concentration. And they costs quite a lot. You can pick some late in game to ease some situations, but in most cases using Alchemy on offence will get the job done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Bless – if you use this use on yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Slow monster – basically also use on yourself. Low speed is direct way to increase experience gain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Invisibility – usable, but is somewhat hard to learn. Potions of invisibility are common enough anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Cure disease/neutralize poison – I prefer herbs instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Web – not that good as Stun ray, but still very welcome addition early to mid game. Wands of webbing are also common stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Farsight – a bit harder to learn, but gives extra range. Very very useful while on cavernous levels. Helps to find and shoot down some nasty guys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Magic map/Identify/Remove curse… useful but both expensive and hard to learn. Without Concentration you can skip these until late game and even when you won’t finf yourself using them very often. (Remove curse and Kinslayer sounds like good combination for me).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/8806081913447230424/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=8806081913447230424' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/8806081913447230424'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/8806081913447230424'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2007/12/killing-in-style-guide-to-being.html' title='Killing in Style (Guide to being an Assassin by Soirana)'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3710148354194913408.post-6542054434381428720</id><published>2007-11-29T00:58:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-11-30T00:01:24.893+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='barbarian'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='guide'/><title type='text'>Guide to Being a Barbarian</title><content type='html'>The next class that I shall talk about is, yet again, one of the easier classes to play in general: the Barbarian. If the Archer is the king of missile weapons, you could call the Barbarian king of melee weapons. No one can surpass the barbarian in raw strength and brute force. They are quite enjoyable to play, and I recommend playing a barbarian (especially an orcish one) to any beginner - though they do offer some challenges later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall keep the structure of my Archer guide for this one, of course in a modified (and hopefully improved) version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual Information - The most basic stuff, reprinted in place of an introduction.&lt;br /&gt;II. Starting up the Barbarian - All there is to consider when deciding which kind of Barbarian to play.&lt;br /&gt;III. Playing style - Brute force or no brute force, that is the question.&lt;br /&gt;IV. Equipment - What you should use, what you should get&lt;br /&gt;V. Barbarian vs. Boss - Hints on how to beat your most dangerous opponents throughout the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BARBARIAN -- Barbarians hail from the harsh northern lands of Ancardia, from the roughest mountain peaks, the wildest hills and the most remote forests. What they lack in equipment, they more than equalize with their great strength, enormous toughness and deadly weaponry. Barbarians are very well experienced in the arts of battle and are well prepared to cope with the dangers of the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians are trained in the following skills: Athletics, Climbing, Dodge, First Aid, Herbalism, Stealth, Survival, Swimming, Two Weapon Combat, and Woodcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High-level barbarians are fearsome fighters. At level 6 they learn to deliver mighty blows that cause double damage (for the cost of 2500 energy points). At level 12 moving costs but 750 energy points. At level 18 they can deliver tremendous blows that cause triple damage (for the cost of 4000 energy points). At level 25 they start to gain +1d4 additional hit points per level. At level 32 barbarians gain a one-time bonus of +3 to strength and toughness. At level 40 they gain a +10 damage bonus with each melee attack when fighting as a true berserker (which basically means that they have to fight naked, e.g. without any armor, and switching the tactics rating to the appropriate setting). At level 50 melee attacks take up but 800 energy points when fighting as a true berserker.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Note that both the mighty and the tremendous blow count only for the first blow, even if the character is delivering a series of blows (because he wields more than one weapon, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II. Starting up the Barbarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Starsigns&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians love the Dragon and Sword starsigns for their weapon skill training boni. They also find Raven and Candle quite nice, because Healing and Speed are useful to anyone, if only to run away and fight another day. Candle has the added bonus of providing an extra talent - most Barbarians can make good use of their talents. Raven, on the other hand, enables you to get a certain powerful artifact weapon a lot earlier than Barbarians of other starsigns. If you get one of these four starsigns, your Barbarians is set for a pretty nice game. Unicorn is again of use for those paranoid about corruption. The Falcon starsign does not grant Barbarians a new skill since they already have survival and is thus inferior to Candle; also offers an extra talent, though. Sadly, any of the spellcasting starsigns will not be of much help to a Barbarian, since they'll never become spellcasters worth anything even with the Book starsign. That doesn't mean you can't win with a Salamander-born Barbarian - it just doesn't help much. The Sword or Candle starsigns are probably the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. General starting equipment&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians vary quite a lot in their equipment. They do have some things in common, though. First, they all get a melee weapon of some sort, except hurthlings, who get a joke. Also, they get some very basic armor (leather or furs) which is inferior to, say, a Paladin's, Fighter's or Priest's. Sometimes, they get basic ranged weaponry, probably because they are skilled hunters. Barbarians also start out with more food than most classes, but I believe it's as random as it is race-dependant, as I have found loaves of elven bread even on other characters than elves occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Race-specific starting equipment, evaluation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Human:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Amulet of luck, light furs, two-handed sword, leather boots, dagger, fire-making equipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lucky, two-handed sword is a powerful weapon&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mediocre strength and toughness, low PV, less than impressive skillset&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: One of the weaker choices. The human Barbarian has exactly two good items: The amulet and the sword. With the sword, he can potentially defeat anything in the beginning; but due to his low PV and toughness, he'll still get hurt frequently and may still die. Also, he only adds one skill to the Barbarian skillset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Troll:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Bridge Building, Food Preservation, Gemology, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Thick furs, heavy club, lots of rocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Incredible strength and toughness&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Troll metabolism and troll experience, short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Very good, if somewhat stereotypical choice. Trollish Barbarians can crush anything that crosses their path and heal fast. Thanks to their high toughness, they even get pretty nice PV despite having only thick furs as armor. Also, Gemology and Food Preservation are regarded as very useful skills. Of course, they have the same disadvantages as every troll: Slow leveling up, increased food consumption, a short lifespan. Especially the slow leveling makes playing this guy a bit tedious as the game continues. I have yet to win with a troll. I probably lack the patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) High Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Literacy&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Leather armor, hooded cloak, long sword, leather boots, short bow, some arrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Literate Barbarian, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mediocre strength, low toughness, low PV, weak weapon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: A lousy choice. High elves and gray elves are, however, the only way to start out with a literate Barbarian. If you want to be able to read right from the start as a Barbarian, you have no choice but to play a high elf or gray elf - the former are the slightly better, if still terrible, choice due to better toughness and HP regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Gray Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Literacy&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Leather armor, hooded cloak, long sword, leather boots, long bow, about 20 arrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Literate Barbarian, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low strength and toughness, low PV, weak weapon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: See High Elf. It should be noted that gray elves get a long bow while high elves only get a short bow. This is probably so there is a reason to actually play gray elven Barbarians instead of high elven. If you want that long bow and the higher amount of ammunition and don't mind the lower physical stats and HP regeneration, gray elves are for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Dark Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Alertness, Find Weakness&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: hood, clothes, hooded cloak, two short swords, light boots, throwing knife, potions of poison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Awesome skills, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low strength and toughness, starting equipment sucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: A nice choice for those who don't mind a bit of difficulties during the early game if it means having what is probably the best skillset of any Barbarian. They start with zero PV, however, and are thus very frail, especially since they deal lousy damage and have really slow toughness and HP regeneration. Make use of your poison against powerful opponents early on. Definitely not a recommended option for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Dwarf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Detect traps, Smithing, Metallurgy, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Bone helmet, thick furs, battle axe, leather boots, throwing clubs, lots of booze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Decent strength and toughness, Detect traps, decent lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Added skills either obtainable in-game or not that useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This is a good choice. It's not spectacular, but since you get decent strength and toughness to work with and don't have the experience penalty of a troll, it's hard to find any particular weakness as well. The armor you start out with is pretty decent for a Barbarian, though it does need work. The booze can be kept to recharge wands you find early on, or exchanged for other potions by Yggaz. That's hardly of use, though, since you can't use these safely anyway until you identify them - and to identify items, you need Literacy and a suitable scroll. I'd probably keep the booze for recharging wands, as Barbarians are terrible at regular spellcasting. Play one of these on New Year's Eve to get even more booze :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Gnome:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Pick pockets, Gemology, Mining, Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Hood, light furs, spear, light boots, sling, a lot of rocks, firemaking equipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Several useful skills added, equipment ain't half bad, extra talent&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low strength, low PV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Despite the ridiculousness of the mental image, gnomes aren't that bad as Barbarians - they add some nice skills (Most notably Gemology in combination with Mining and Ventriloquism). Their large stock of rocks at the beginning coupled with their sling may help in dispatching early game opponents. Still, gnomes lack a bit in the physical department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Hurthling:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Archery, Cooking, Food Preservation, Gardening&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Light furs, club, cursed ring, short bow, lots of arrows, firemaking equipment, cooking set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lots of arrows, high dexterity, extra talent, Archery&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Horrible strength, a friggin' club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Hurthling and Barbarian? Almost sounds like it should be impossible, right? Well, they add some skills - the usual hurthling fare. They also start out with a whole lot of arrows. Indeed, their starting equipment makes them look like they'd be better as archers than as melee fighters. It's your archery that will enable you to survive the early game, and it can be improved with the right talents to make your hurthling Barbarian a missile weapon powerhouse. Find some decent armor and melee weapon, and you can go into melee like the other Barbarians. Hurthlings might never be the strongest in melee (though there are ways to increase strength to ludicrous amounts - stone giant stew, yum yum), but their missile skills make up for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Orc:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Backstabbing, Find Weakness, Metallurgy, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Orcish helmet, studded leather armor, orcish spear, heavy boots, some rocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: High strength and toughness, powerful starting equipment, nice skills&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the best Barbarian race of all. I count 6 starting PV on equipment alone; add the toughness bonus and you start out with PV of 8 or more. Double digits are entirely possible (not even rare) if you luck out with starting equipment or become particularly tough. Add to that awesome melee damage thanks a decent starting weapon and super strength and the fact that you get one of the best skill additions for the Barbarian (second only to the dark elven skillset, Gemology lovers aside) - what's not to love? Well, the threat of being aged to death. Avoid meleeing ghosts, even bats and especially lords and kings, like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Drakeling:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Alertness, Food Preservation, Music&lt;br /&gt;Starting equipment: Heavy spear, throwing club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: High strength and toughness, Acid Breath, Alertness&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Underwhelming starting equipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Considering the fact they get so few starting equipment, Drakelings are actually pretty good. Their starting weapon isn't bad, and they get some basic PV due to their high toughness. You simply have to find your equipment yourself. The skills of a Drakeling are also nice to have, as well as the ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Conclusion: Orcs make the best Barbarians. Trolls, while being stronger, lack the equipment of orcs and have to struggle with their low levelup. Dark elves, while being even a little bit more awesome than orcs skillwise, have considerable difficulties surviving the early game. Afther these three, dwarves and drakelings make pretty decent Barbarians overall, dwarves offer good equipment, drakelings nice skills. They are followed by gnomes and hurthlings, the latter being an interesting choice if you want to maximize the missile weapon potential for your Barbarian (which is probably a good idea if you plan on engaging Andor Drakon - Blessed humanoid slaying ammunition is one of the best ways to defeat him). After those humans, who have the best weapon but more or less suck in any other respect, and on the last place high and gray elves, who simply suck with next to no redeeming qualities. You should, however, gain some knowledge about the skills every race gets so you can build your own opinion who suits your playing style best. (Who knows, you might love the Literacy skill so much that you can't wait till Dwarftown to get it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should nevertheless be noted that regardless of your playing style, orcs pwn the other races at being Barbarian so hard it's not even funny. You can't say no to an orcish Barbarian! Actually, you can't say anything at all because he already knocked your teeth out, but even so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;III. Playing style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Barbarians in general&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians are melee powerhouses, and the good news is that they can win the game with this ability. Melee fighting, however, has its risks and dangers, the most notable being that while few enemies can attack from a distance, all can attack in melee. Some can dish out such an awful lot of damage that meleeing them is almost suicide. Luckily, all Barbarians gain missile weapon skills quickly, and a certain Barbarian class power would make any poorly endowed (seven leagues-less) Archer weep with jealousy. A smart Barbarian trains his missile weapon skills and makes use of slaying ammunition. Wands are your friend as a substitution for some spells. But if all else fails, berserk tremendous blows just might be the thing to kill your opponent in a last ditch effort.&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians love to have high DV, PV, to-hit and especially melee damage. They also love to be speedy - as does anyone, granted. They have no use for Charisma, Appearance and Mana, and they don't particularly need to have decent Learning, Perception, or Willpower (high Learning gives more skill advances, high Willpower has an effect on HP, increases your resistance to confusion attacks and is a requirement for entering the Rift, high Perception improves your chances to evade traps and lets you look farther). Strength and Toughness are the most important stats, and high Dexterity helps a lot because of the speed, DV and to-hit boni you get out of it. Lastly, to be a good Barbarian you need to have some grasp of the tactics settings. Right use of them can win or lose battles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Barbarian class powers&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians get their two core class powers at level 6 and 18: The mighty blow and the tremendous blow. On the first glance, you might find that dealing double (triple) damage isn't that nice if it takes MORE than double (triple) the time to get ready for the next move. Not to mention that while you recover from using your mighty (worse: tremendous) blow, the opponent has enough time to potentially score some bad criticals without giving you the opportunity to gulp down a life-saving blessed potion of extra healing. Fighting normally should deal more damage over a certain time and even improve on your abilities to react. So what makes the mighty and he tremendous blow actually worthwhile to use?&lt;br /&gt;Two cases can be made. The less important: If you kill your enemy with a tremendous or mighty blow, it can't actually make any use of the time you spend recovering from using the blow. This way, by killing your opponent in one shot, you avoid having to spend several turns in which the opponent can attack you. For some opponents, going into berserk mode and trying to deal a tremendous blow is actually preferable to having a long drawn-out fight.&lt;br /&gt;The other case, which is the more important one, is described with the following term: Monster PV. Mighty blow and tremendous blow would indeed be almost completely useless if monsters had no PV. It's simple maths, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us assume you have a weapon that always hits and deals 20 damage. Monster A has zero PV, while monster B has 10 and monster C has 20. How much damage will you deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) using normal attacks that deal normal damage each round, or&lt;br /&gt;b) using tremendous blows that can only be used once every four rounds which cause triple damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;until 20 rounds have passed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a)&lt;br /&gt;Monster A: You deal 20 damage in every one of the 20 rounds: 400 damage.&lt;br /&gt;Monster B: You deal 10 damage in every one of the 20 rounds: 200 damage.&lt;br /&gt;Monster C: You fail to do any damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b)&lt;br /&gt;Monster A: You deal 60 damage every fourth round: 300 damage.&lt;br /&gt;Monster B: You deal 50 damage every fourth round: 250 damage.&lt;br /&gt;Monster C: You deal 40 damage every fourth round: 200 damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you notice the effect? The higher the PV of the monster you fight, the more worthwhile it becomes to use tremendous blows. Against monsters with zero or negligible PV, tremendous blows (or mighty blows, for that matter) are only to be used if you are reasonably sure you can kill them with ONE tremendous blow and wait out the 4000 (2500) energy points (modified by weapon skill appropriately!) while not being attacked at all. The same thing is true if you use a weapon that bypasses PV: Tremendous blow and mighty blow will be mostly useless then.&lt;br /&gt;Tremendous blows should, if possible, be used in conjunction with berserk tactics. There are two reasons: First, you get the maximal gain of the tripling with berserk damage; Second, you can be reasonably sure your attack connects that way. Nothing's more embarassing than trying a tremendous blow and missing, though it might not matter that much statistically. (Against a high PV monster, a tremendous blow hit may be better than four normal hits, but a tremendous MISS is just as bad...)&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, though: With the mighty and especially tremendous blow, Barbarians can sneer at high PV monsters and low PV monsters alike, and definitely don't need to fear not being able to get through any kind of defense. (Except if your weapon really sucks ass.)&lt;br /&gt;Mighty and tremendous blows have to be carefully used, of course. The tactical disadvantage of not being able to react for a prolonged time should not be underestimated...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level 12 Barbarian class power increases your walking speed by reducing the number of energy points walking consumes. However, when you're engaged in melee, weapon attack speed is more important. Still, it helps if you engage in missile combat - and most Barbarians do that from time to time. Skilled players make use of this class power even in melee, by attacking an opponent in berserk mode with higher attacking speed due to weapon skill and immediately retreating before the opponent can get a hit in, and repeating this - let the opponent come near, attack him, retreat before he can attack back - until the opponent is dead. It's the same method employed by Archers and other ranged fighters, only that it's safer with ranged weapons since you don't have to even let the enemy near you. And Archers have to use seven league boots or higher speed to pull it off like a level 12 Barbarian. Hurthlings are especially grateful for this class power, because it allows them to become great archers themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Barbarian has reached level 25? Congratulations. The class power that kicks in now will kick in for every level till the last. You now get extra hitpoints in addition to the ones you already got because of your high toughness and being a Barbarian in general. Nice class power, because while having tons of hitpoints is good, having megatons of them is better. I don't think you can even have enough hitpoints. 26d4 is the total amount of hitpoints you will gain (1d4 for every level after and including level 25); why this may turn out to be as low as 26, it can theoretically go up to 104 in total. The average is 65 hit points. That may not sound like too much since endgame (level 50) Barbarians with high toughness (morgia, class power, potions of toughness...) can expect to have a value over 1000. But in blessed potions of ultra healing (another way of increasing the hitpoint count), 65 hitpoints would require about thirty to achieve. Every single point can save your Barbarian ass if you overestimated your battle prowess and meleed a greater moloch, so be grateful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 32 brings a good increase of Strength and Toughness, the most important stats of any Barbarian. At this point in the game, both should be pretty high already so the increase benefits you more. Another nice treat in any case, even though this one is a one-time deal and you can possibly lose the extra stat points again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 40 and 50 have to be evaluated together because they serve the same purpose: Improving the Barbarian's abilities as a true berserker. Fighting as a true berserker is like a stage above normal berserking, only that your to-hit and damage is increased while DV stays the same as in berserk mode. To be a true berserker, however, you must not wear armor while berserking. No helmets, body armor, girdles, bracers, gauntlets, boots. You may only equip amulets and rings, a weapon and a shield as well as missile weapons, missiles and tools. Only if you meet these requirements will you get the "You lust for blood!" message once you attack an opponent in berserk mode, and thus be a true berserker. Needless to say, this is a risky route to take. On level 50 and even level 40, you don't actually need to be a true berserker to utterly destroy everything in your path, and it might be more worthwhile to engage dangerous opponents properly protected. Nevertheless, a true berserker landing a tremendous blow with Vanquisher is probably the highest in melee damage you will ever get with any character (insta-killing hits of the assassin and monk aside). Depending on the quality of your rings, amulets and shields, your skills, talents and weapon skills and your dexterity and toughness attributes, you'll get at least some degree of DV/PV even while true berserking. If you feel that the enormous increase in damage and attack speed on level 50 justifies the sacrificed armor value, by all means go ahead. After all, there are few things cooler than a true berserking barbarian! Though there are also few things deader if you don't watch out... (Don't forget that while in true berserk mode, you can't distinguish friend from foe - meaning you don't get "Do you really want to attack (whoever)" messages anymore...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Monsters to watch out for&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there are not many monsters that pose a serious problem to Barbarians. While they may pose a threat, your Barbarian is still fully capable of destroying them. In the early game, gray oozes and ochre jellies have the annoying habit of dissolving your melee weapon; if you fight hordes (or even one) of these, you should either switch to a stone, eternium or artifact weapon (as only these are immune to corrosion) or to missile attacks. If you have none of these, you can also try your luck with unarmed attacks, but that's going to destroy your gauntlets and damage you unless you have artifact gauntlets or acid resistance. If you have artifact or eternium boots, you can also kick the jelly without suffering damage. It doesn't help that gray oozes and ochre jellies are breeders. Another way of dealing with them might be to use expendable melee weapons, but they get corroded so badly so quickly killing the jelly will take forever, giving them time to breed. If you took the time to pick up all those crude knives from those last three orc tension rooms, throw them instead. Using spare gloves and boots might be another way. And note that fighting jelly is a method useful to get rid of cursed melee weapons, boots or gloves.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of enemies that either hit so hard or have so dangerous effects that you should rather switch to missile weapons or at least defeat them quickly (eternium golems, greater molochs, emperor liches). There is only one opponent, however, that is not only too dangerous to engage in melee against, but also immune to missile attacks: You. I mean a doppleganger king. Doppleganger kings have several attacks, each one of these with an attack power possibly greater than that of your own character. And in case you forgot, your Barbarian deals loads of damage! Like with any doppleganger, missiles are simply deflected. Your only chance against doppleganger kings is spells, and your pretty much only source of spells is wands. Hit 'em with magic missiles, cold, acid, fire, lightning - whatever you have, until they finally croak. Thankfully they do not seem to be able to copy your immunities and resistances, and they are so rare and appear so late in the game you're bound to have enough wands to deal with them. You could also cast a darkness spell (scroll or crystal) and try to engange in melee; I heard doppleganger kings can't fight back in the darkness. In that case, switch to berserk, as that makes the doppleganger king easier to hit. You can also try to throw a potion of exchange at the bastard. And if all else fails, run away. And DON'T let one get near you! Luckily, doppleganger kings are rare. Still, once you have advanced far enough, I strongly advise you watch out for opponents with the same symbol as yourself. It could be a caveman. It could just be your old buddy Hawkslayer you hired. It could be weaker dopplegangers. But a doppleganger king will confuse you so you won't get away and hit you like hell in the same round - even kill you. Watch out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Battle tactics&lt;br /&gt;Your tactics stance depends heavily on the type of your opponent and your own equipment. Generally, you should not fight too defensively, especially if you're not wearing a shield. That may sound contradictory - surely you need to be more careful if you do not have a shield to rely on? - but remember that you acquire less weapon skill marks while fighting defensively, and more shield marks instead. So if you fight defensively without a shield to gain shield skill marks with, you won't accumulate a lot of marks in general.&lt;br /&gt;Switch to coward you should for every turn, however, in which you neither attack or use ranged weapons. For example, if you drink a potion or use a scroll or wand, or even walk around (though it tires me out to walk around in Coward all the time and switch for every single fucking goblin - remember that killing monsters while in coward mode doesn't train weapon skills). For missile attacks the basic archer principle still applies: If they can't hit you, go berserk!&lt;br /&gt;Does your opponent attack slowly and not hit hard, but you don't have much time yourself due to being poisoned or soon to be surrounded? Berserk him away! Has your opponent annoyingly high PV? Use berserk or very aggressive tremendous blows. Are you almost dead and your opponent still has half his life? Switch to berserk and do a tremendous blow - you just might survive. Generally, if you are reasonably sure one more berserk tremendous blow will do the trick and there are no other (notable) opponents around, go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;Once you've obtained the Tactics skill and increased it to decent values, you'll notice that using normal tactics at all is suboptimal, simply because all the other settings offer a lot of gain for little sacrifice. Choose Aggressive or Defensive instead, or Very Aggressive and Very Defensive.&lt;br /&gt;Hit and run tactics are also very useful. You need high movement and attack speeds for that. Starting from level 12, the former is guaranteed. The latter will also be easily obtained simply by training melee weapon skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Mad Barbarian skillz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Athletics&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful skill. It increases your speed as well as your chance to get physical stat increases. Strength, Dexterity, Toughness and Appearance are increased more often while having this skill. Higher skill values get you more speed and increase the chances to get a stat increase. You want this skill at 100 as soon as possible, to get the best out of the increases and because speed is awesome. It levels up easy, so you should manage to get there during your early tens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Climbing&lt;br /&gt;This skill can, in one situation, save your hide: When you've fallen into a pit while on the run from an unbeatable monster. Your chance to climb out of the pit in time is directly influenced by the Climbing skill. Unbeatable monsters are rare for Barbarians. Pit traps are also not exactly plenty. To get both at once is extremely unlikely. Apart from that, Climbing has the semi-useful treat that you can climb through mountain ranges faster if your skill level is higher. Given the time PCs of all classes have to spend in the mountain ranges (next to none; almost the only place you need to climb through mountain ranges to get to is the valley in the upper left part of the wilderness) this is hardly useful. Climbing needs to be maxed, however, if you want to climb down the Rift. Without 100 skill points in Climbing, that dungeon and the Library it contains a passage to are utterly unreachable. Now, you're a Barbarian, so a Library may be the last place you want to visit - unless you want to get the weird tome to exchange it for five scrolls of chaos resistance. Well, finally interested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Dodge&lt;br /&gt;Similar to Athletics in that it's awesome and certain skill levels in it translate directly into a bonus for an important value, this time DV. Higher DV means less likely to be hit by monsters. Barbarians throw themselves into the fray of battle frequently, and thus have every reason to have this skill as high as possible - even the fiercest warrior doesn't have unlimited hitpoints. Max it as the levels come by. Note that for some reason, Dodge becomes hard to raise beyond the sixties at higher character levels (probably because training it seems to get more difficult), so don't neglect this skill - you want it at 100 under all circumstances!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) First Aid&lt;br /&gt;A good helper in the early game, where every hitpoint can save your ass. After you've suffered damage for any reason (self-induced spell damage may not qualify, though) you can apply this skill to patch up the worst. This also holds true for poison damage and feverish fits caused by sickness. Sometimes, the poison loses some of its power and may even be removed after successfully applying First Aid. Sometimes, even your sickness may be healed. The First Aid skill can mean the difference between life and death, but its success depends largely on its skill level: A low-level First Aid skill is unreliable at best. Later on, when you have obtained Healing and regeneration items and lots of spenseweed, alraunia antidote and curaria mancox, First Aid will become obsolete. Increasing this skill should either be done during the first levels or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Haggling&lt;br /&gt;You can apply this skill on a shopkeeper, with success depending on the skill value and probably the charisma stat. If you succeed, prices will drop. If you fail, prices will rise. Skill advances are too precious to waste on this useless nonsense. Also, don't use this skill if your skill level is low, the effect will be disastrous. If you decide, for some unfathomable reason, to invest in this skill, make sure it is very high before you even think about using it. And try to have the Charisma to back up your feeble efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Herbalism&lt;br /&gt;Some may call this skill very useful, others may call it extremely uber-useful. When you encounter patches of herbs, you can pick them - that any character can do even without Herbalism. (ADOM does have its strong points compared to games where you have to gain six levels to gain the ability to freaking SIT DOWN.) With the Herbalism skill however, you can pick more herbs before the bush vanishes - and maybe even more importantly, you can pick herbs that aren't cursed. The cursed/uncursed/blessed ratio improves with every point you spend on this skill. At level 100, roughly two thirds of the herbs picked will be blessed. It's also possible to apply the skill on a herb patch to find out what kind of herbs there are. The intricacies of herb-harvesting should be looked up elsewhere, here only this hint: A 2x2 herb square (consisting of four patches) is the herb square you want, because even if you pick up so many herbs from one patch that it disappears, it will regrow eventually. If you find a lot of herb patches, remember that if you remove all the patches except for an L-shaped group of three patches, these will grow into the 2x2 patch. As long as you take care not to pick more than herb patch to death at once, you have yourself an infinite supply of herbs. Anyway, if you look at how herbs grow and wither away, you might notice that this follows a certain set of rules. Ever heard of Conway's Game of Life? Look it up! There are patterns that can lead to outright herb explosion, and tons of simulators available to help you find these patterns! (Want to know  more about herbs? What, do I look like a gardener to you? Check the guidebook!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Listening&lt;br /&gt;This skill lets you hear things. Everyone and their grandma has this skill by virtue of having ears. With higher skill values, your character may more often get messages like "You hear the sound of rushing water" when a monster steps on a water trap, or "You hear the sound of toppling stones" if any monster was unlucky enough to trigger a stone block trap. Thundering explosions, pained yells in the distance and other stuff that would make for a spooky atmosphere if it were converted into an actual sound file. Note that this is also the skill, like it or not, that enables you to hear the wails of banshees (Don't worry, there is only one in the game and you won't meet her for quite some time) and die shortly afterwards. No, you can't unlearn the skill. Luckily, there are ways to become deaf. The Mad Minstrel actually has a pretty nice hint about that whole Banshee situation. ("Beware is what you need, understand this verb and take heed"!) The Listening skill need not be increased. Not only is its benefit pretty small, it also increases itself wonderfully and you don't need it at 100 for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Stealth&lt;br /&gt;If you're stealthy, monsters will have a harder time seeing you. This means you can sneak up on and backstab them with the appropriate skill, or sneak behind them to better position yourself. It doesn't always work, of course, not even with skill level 100. And if you attack a monster, you draw attention to yourself. Barbarians aren't the sneaky type. This skill usually increases itself; it should be noted, however, that it might not reach 100 by itself until rather late in the game. There is, however, one point in the game where you want this skill at 100, or to be exact, someone else wants it: The Ghost Librarian. He hates noise. He REALLY REALLY hates noise. Only those with Stealth at 100 who don't utter a single word (i. e. cast no spells and don't chat with monsters) for at least 2000 turns (hell if I know the exact number) are worthy of delivering stuff for him - namely, the weird tome. Five scrolls of chaos resistance are the reward of this delivery. Read it again: FIVE scrolls of CHAOS RESISTANCE. Now you feel better about spending a couple of increases to max Stealth, right? Note that if you messed it up and did utter a word, it doesn't (at least not always) destroy your chances to get the weird tome - the timer is (hopefully) simply reset and you have to wait for 2000 turns (or more, whatever, give it to me already) again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Survival&lt;br /&gt;This skill is usually not important. In the early game, you might run into food problems - in that case, a high Survival skill in the wilderness might just save your life. However, smart players know that Munxip's large rations sell cheap. A high Survival skill is also useful to avoid being ambushed by unfair wilderness encounters like they can occur once a month or so has passed. Dorn Beasts for instance can paralyze and easily kill you if you're ambushed by them. Still, that kind of bad luck is tremendously rare. Increase this skill in case you have skill advances left after you've increased all your more important skills to the max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Swimming&lt;br /&gt;Another one of those skills that can save your life in a tough spot. Whether water is what saves you from death at the hands of a pursuing monster or the obstacle that prevents you from escaping and saving your life depends on your Swimming skill. The better you are at Swimming, the less likely is it that you take damage while inside a body of water, and drowning damage becomes lower in general. The swimming skill also affects how fast you move underwater. It's one of those potentially lifesaving skills that come into play so rarely you don't know whether you should actually increase it. I feel safer in the early game with a decent Swimming skill, though, especially since your way to the next down staircase might be blocked by a river eventually - and sometimes there could also be no going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Two Weapon Combat&lt;br /&gt;This skill improves to-hit and increases the attacking speed for fighting with two weapons. It's simple, really. If you don't plan on fighting with two weapons, you don't need any skill point at all in this skill. If you want to use two weapons, you should have this skill as high as ever possible, because otherwise your to-hit and attacking speed simply will be too dismal for it to be worth it. It depends entirely on you. Note that if you use a Barbarian blow, only your first weapon will actually be dealing the blow - the second will attack normally. That's why I think Barbarians aren't cut out for this Two Weapon Combat thing in any case. (Don't bring up Needle and Sting now - everybody can dual-wield them and be a badass, even a wizard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Woodcraft&lt;br /&gt;This skill shortens the time it takes to chop trees. That means it's useless. If you ever need a tree, you need it for Bridge Building. If you ever need Bridge Building, you need it at precisely one point in the game (You have Swimming, remember?). Even at that point, a wand of cold works well enough. If you don't have a wand of cold and don't find one, yes, in that case you may need some tree logs. But even in that very, very special case, you should increase Bridge Building, not Woodcraft, as chopping trees doesn't require any sort of successful skill check, and it doesn't save you time if you can chop trees quicker if you need twenty more logs just to get three bridge segments done. It should be noted that the skill becomes somewhat more useful if you manage to obtain the Fletchery skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Mad non-Barbarian skillz&lt;br /&gt;Note that these skills can - aside from playing the mentioned races - all be obtained by either wishing for them or using a potion or scroll of education, unless stated otherwise. If a skill can also be obtained in the game with other means, the way to get it is also described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Alertness&lt;br /&gt;A specialty of dark elves and drakelings. This skill increases both your chance to notice traps at the last possible moment, evading them, and your chance to evade spells cast by those pesky dark sages and chaos archmages - a useful and potentially life-saving effect, as you can see, regardless of early, mid or late game. And if that wasn't enough, high skill values even get you extra DV points. Everybody loves extra DV! In short, Alertness prevents your character from dying in many ways. It isn't quick to increase, but you should always be near your max for that skill. As it is unobtainable from anyone in the game and can't even be wished for (Wishing for "Alertness" only gives you an increase of your Perception attribute), you can only get it from potions or scrolls of education - if you're very lucky. That's why dark elves and drakelings are tempting choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Archery&lt;br /&gt;All hurthlings like to throw rocks at cars driving by on the interstate, so they all start out with this skill. It improves your missile damage, to-hit, and (in some way) range. As described in the manual, a Barbarian gets +1 to hit per 25 points and +1 to damage per 40 points. With Archery at 100, you get +5 to hit and +2 to damage. That doesn't sound like a whole lot? You might be right. However, the Archery skill has another feature - it's a prerequisite for the talents Lightning Shot and Eagle-Eyed. The latter adds almost as much to-hit and damage as the Archery skill itself, and the former increases your missile weapon attack speed considerably. You need the Archery skill at high levels to get these talents; but that shouldn't be much of a problem. Hurthling Barbarians will be a lot better at using missile weapons than any other type of Barbarian thanks to this skill. Indeed, the "only" things they lack compared to real Archers are the Fletchery skill, a bit to-hit and damage and, well, the absolutely awesome archery-related class powers. However, they get a movement speed increase, a valuable asset for any user of missile weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Backstabbing&lt;br /&gt;Orcs are sneaky chaotic assholes, that's why they start with this skill. It gives you an enormous damage bonus when you manage to catch an opponent off-guard, either because you're very stealthy or even invisible, or he's blind, or he was neutral to you and didn't expect to be attacked. Since even against your regular dungeon opponent this has a chance of kicking in thanks to Stealth and you use melee weapons extensively anyway, this is actually a nice skill, especially when combined with berserk mode and the tremendous blow technique. Imagine sneaking behind someone and in a berserk frenzy plunging Vanquisher into the back of your victim with tremendous power and a loud warcry! If that doesn't kill, nothing will. A very nice skill to have, especially if you find a cloak of invisibility... Heh heh... You don't need to play orcs to get this skill, however: Bart, the grizzled gladiator teaches it to you if you give him the golden gladius. Backstabbing becomes easy to increase after some hours spent on slaying monsters in melee, and the higher it is, the greater the devastation you can bring onto your enemy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Bridge Building&lt;br /&gt;Trolls live under bridges and thus have lots of time to study the intricacies of building them. You need a hatchet and logs to build a bridge segment, but there is a chance of failure depending on your skill value. Since you can swim and you can build bridges without even spending a point in this skill by using wands of cold, this loser skill does not deserve your attention. (It's true that ice bridges only hold if you're carrying not more than 2000 stones, but for Christ's sake - take several trips!) Trolls get it (without a manual, which makes it all the more pointless), but everyone else can easily obtain it too, especially since all Barbarian players with some Learning points left (so to speak) choose the Yrrigs quest to get Healing. Everyone does that quest to get Healing even though Bridge Building is the actual "reward" of the quest itself... Either kill Yrrigs to get his manual and learn Bridge Building from it, or save him and learn Bridge Building from him (or the manual that he leaves behind). Or just don't bother. You can only increase this skill if you still have your manual; allow for it to be destroyed and you have to naturally train the skill, which takes ages to get anywhere. I could rant on more about how useless this skill is (such as logs being heavy as ass), but I want to get to the end of this guide before I push up daisies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Cooking&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings love good food, and somehow consider knowing how to cook an essential part of becoming an adventurer. Note that you need to have a cooking set to use that skill. Hurthlings start out with one, but need to find another if that one gets destroyed. There are two possible outcomes if you cook a corpse or piece of raw or fish meat: Either you succeed in cooking and get a cooked corpse, fresh meat or fried fish meat, or you ruin the corpse, upon which it disappears. Your chance to succeed is directly related to your skill value. Cooking stuff increases the nutritious value and heavily decreases (but not completely stops) the rate at which the food rots. Because there are some corpses you can exchange for nice stuff - Guth'Alak will give you potions of cure corruption if you bring him the corpses of very chaotic creatures - it's a good idea to cook these corpses so you have a chance to deliver them in time. Hurthlings start with a high skill value good for everyday goblin cooking, but it should be improved further before cooking the most valuable corpses to minimize the risk of ruining them. This skill is nice and pretty much takes out starvation as an early game killer especially combined with Food Preservation, but pales in comparison to some skills other races offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Detect traps&lt;br /&gt;Dwarves have a special attunement to underground dungeons of all type and thus start out with this skill. You know about the 's'earch command, right? A normal character without the Detect traps skill can only find secret doors with this command, while a character with the Detect traps skill can also detect traps located in any of the adjacent squares, including door traps. Once detected, any character should be able to bypass the trap, though low Perception and Dexterity values may pose a risk. The Detect traps skill only works its wondrous magic when you are actively searching your surroundings; your character won't spontaneously detect a trap with this skill (that's what Alertness is for). The skill value of your Detect traps skill determines your chance to find nearby traps when searching: Even with a skill value of 1, there is a basic chance to find a trap, though it is very low and it will take a lot of searching to find any trap. Note that Detect traps works with a ring of searching. Since the ring of searching causes you to make only one magical search check (which is "free", i.e. does not take additional time) for every step you move, you should have a high Detect traps skill if you want to rely on the ring finding most traps. Later on in the game, characters may grow so powerful that they feel they can simply absorb the damage of all the traps found in the dungeons - but they forget you can't absorb the emotional damage losing your only pair of seven league boots to an acid or ceiling trap causes. Places like the Minotaur Maze or the Mana Temple should not be visited without a means to detect traps, period. There is a wand that automatically detects all traps within line of sight, but wands can run out, be destroyed and be drained by the mana battery corruption - the Detect traps skill cannot. This skill is nice for early game survival, especially when you use it before opening or even touching any door. Yergius, the master thief of the Thieves Guild that resides in Lawenilotehl, can teach this skill to you for a price (usually about 3000 gp), but will do so only to members. To become a member, you need the Pick Pockets skill. Check the Pick Pockets skill description for further instructions. Dwarves don't need to go through all that hassle to get the skill, and there is no good reason not to obtain this skill for Barbarians of the other races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Find weakness&lt;br /&gt;A wicked and especially nasty personality grants this skill upon all orcs and dark elves. This skill increases your chance to score critical hits. A critical hit causes double the damage of what a normal hit would have dealt. This applies to any melee and missile attack you make. As a result of the higher critical chance, this skill greatly improves the damage you deal to all opponents on average, especially taking enemies' PV into account (The maths is similar to what was shown regarding the mighty and tremendous blow class powers). The effect becomes, of course, more noticable the higher your skill level is. Of course, Vanquisher practically makes this skill obsolete. But who wants to plan ahead for a crowning gift you don't even know you'll get? This skill is the main reason why dark elves and orcs make so DAMN SWEET Barbarians. Make it high priority if you get it since every point will make your life destroying monsters easier. It should be noted that the tremendous and mighty blow class powers can take the place of Find Weakness when it comes to fighting high PV monsters, so you can afford not to get this skill. But it's still damned worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;Being practical people and lovers of good food, humans, drakelings, trolls and hurthlings know this skill from the beginning. Its effects are solely passive. First, the food you carry will rot at a much slower rate, allowing you to keep it in your backpack for a longer time. This isn't quite enough, though, to completely assure that a corpse will hold until you have, say, delivered it to Guth'Alak - you need Cooking for that. It's still somewhat useful since you can keep around a stat-increasing corpse for some time until your bloated status wears off, for instance. The second passive effect of the Food Preservation skill is a lot more useful: It increases the chance that a monster killed by you leaves behind a corpse for you to eat. Yum yum! In the early game, this somewhat helps keeping your character from starvation, combined with the first effect. In the later game when food isn't a problem, you'll still want to eat the corpses of some monsters especially. Giant corpses, blink dog corpses, quickling corpses, giant slug corpses... Anything that increases a stat or grants a rare intrinsic is more than welcome. The effect of the Food Preservation skill becomes greater with skill level. Since this skill does nothing to actually influence your success and prowess in battle, you shouldn't put many skill points in it early on when there's still more useful skills to train - unless, of course, you find yourself constantly aching for food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Gardening&lt;br /&gt;Hurthlings seem to think building a garden is what every adventurer should know, even if they live in Barbaric tribes and hunt for their food. This skill lets you plant seeds. You can plant herb seeds and plant seeds. Plant seeds can grow trees, which means they're useless. Herb seeds aren't useless since they grow herbs, and herbs are very valuable, sometimes essential, to success in ADOM. However, herb seeds are very, very rare, and you can grow herbs with holy water as well by pouring it on the ground. This skill lets you do something with those four, five herb seeds you can ever hope to find in a game and is otherwise utterly useless. It's not worth playing a hurthling for it. Note that you can obtain this skill by choosing the Keethrax quest and, after having slain Keethrax, ask Guth'Alak to be rewarded in knowledge. This course of action is not recommended, as the Healing skill that can be obtained by the Yrrigs quest is a LOT more valuable to a Barbarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Gemology&lt;br /&gt;Both trolls and gnomes seem to be fascinated by shiny things, the first because they have the brains to be fascinated by the shiny things in themselves, the latter because they can sell the shiny things for money. The Gemology skill allows you to identify gems on sight. Given the availability of scrolls of identify, this isn't impressive at all. The side effect, however, is very impressive: If, and only if, your character has the Gemology skill, pieces of wall that are dug up will occasionally leave behind gems, pieces of worthless glass and crystals. A higher skill means a higher chance not only to identify a given gem, but also of a wall leaving behand a gem. This doesn't even require it to be you who mines - even a wall mined by an ant or dwarf will leave behind gems. Now, more gems just get you more money, and the worthless glass is just as worthless to you if it comes by in large numbers, but the crystals are very nice to have in high numbers. They are also good replacements for some scrolls and spells if your character is illiterate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;crystal of power = scroll of power&lt;br /&gt;crystal of light = scroll of light, or a charge of a wand of light&lt;br /&gt;crystal of darkness = scroll of darkness&lt;br /&gt;crystal of fire = one charge of a wand of fireballs&lt;br /&gt;crystal of health = one spenseweed or pepper petal (roughly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only crystals of knowledge don't quite behave just like scrolls of magic mapping. They reveal, even if blessed, only a portion of the map. However, if they're blessed, they can do something scrolls of magic mapping can't do: Increase Learning. You know how rare stat-increasing potions are? With Gemology, a couple of pickaxes and lots of time, you can mine an equivalent of a potion of learning in almost infinite amounts! Now, there are some catches. Crystals of knowledge only work reliably until you reach the mid-twenties of your Learning stat (30 has been observed), giving you at least five skill increases per level. If you ask me, Barbarians don't need a Learning score of higher than twenty anyway - but the three most trolls and even gnomes start out with is definitely shamefully low. And if I had 100 blessed crystals of knowledge, I'd make heavy use of potions of exchange to get all my stats to mid-twenties with them (they are also useful for revealing the dungeon map in this case). Well, do you want this skill? It isn't very useful if you don't exploit it, so it's a question of playing style. Mining sessions are, of course, most time-effective with this skill at 100 (though it's hard to get there without crystals of knowledge in the first place...) and the corresponding Mining skill that both gnomes and trolls gain at 100 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Literacy&lt;br /&gt;Only gray and high elven Barbarian tribes have established a certain level of civilization and teach their children to read and write (while other Barbarian tribes actually taught them how to be a non-sucky Barbarian, but I digress). Without this skill, you can't read and write, neither scrolls nor books. (And you also can't read tombstone epitaphs and fortune cookie fortunes, but that's only mentioned for the sake of completion.) Even with a Literacy skill of 1, you can read all the scrolls in the game; only the result of the scroll of literacy check will be quite unsatisfying. Higher Literacy skill values are needed if you want to decipher tombstones, write scrolls with success, and learn spells from books. While being illiterate can be tolerated in the early game, every character should obtain the Literacy skill if ever possible if he doesn't already have it. Luckily, it can be obtained several ways. First, you can obtain the artifact potion of Literacy from Thrundarr if you fulfill his first quest while illiterate. But if you don't want or can't do that, there is still a chance to obtain the Literacy skill from eating dark sage and black wizard corpses. If you get your hands on such a corpse, bless it just to be safe, munch it and notice how all those tiny specks of ink on that parchment start making sense to you! You shouldn't spend skill increases on this skill unless you really don't have anything better to do, simply because you don't need high values to read scrolls and Barbarians can't use books effectively regardless of what you do. See why gray and high elves are so lousy choices? First, they suck ass, second, the only skill they get added to the Barbarian skillset is one easily obtained for the others within the game. Poor beggars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Metallurgy&lt;br /&gt;You need University and Gunpowder to get this. (Bonus points for anyone who catches the geeky reference!) Orcs fight a lot and thus use metallic melee weapons a lot, and ore mining is a part of dwarven basic culture. Barbarians of both of these races, thus, start the game with basic knowledge in Metallurgy. Metallurgy is similar to Gemology, since it allows to identify pieces of ore. Pieces of ore, however, can be easily identified by their weight, so easily, in fact, that I won't tell you how to do it here. You can also apply Metallurgy on an item to find out whether it is made of metal and with a higher skill level even what metal it is made of. This is somewhat useful if you want to find out whether an item is susceptible to rust and melting, and what ingots you can use to improve it. Yet, this is knowledge that you accumulate yourself, as a player, by playing lots of ADOM with open eyes and knowing the aforementioned method for identifying ore (or having the guidebook appendices handy...). This skill is useful only if you want to smith, and even for that it's far from essential. Don't increase it unless you really have nothing better to do with your skill points. Orcs and dwarves should be chosen for their other merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;m) Mining&lt;br /&gt;Trolls, orcs, gnomes and dwarves spend a lot of their time mining ore and gems and living underground, so it's only natural they start out with this skill. It increases the speed at which you dig through stone with a pickaxe, and decreases the chance that you break your pickaxe. The Mining skill is not required to mine, but it helps quite a lot, especially if you want to mine for gems and ore. However, there are wands of digging in this game, and they can replace pickaxes if you want to mine a corridor to those places that aren't reachable without digging. Since even with a 100 Mining skill, Mining takes some time and is unsuitable for quick escaping, this skill is not terribly important, just nice to have. The same philosophy should govern your skill increases - increase Mining after the more important skills are accounted for. If you love this skill, you'll still have to decide which of the four races that get it to play, though. Note that in the early game mining may be somewhat risky because of sleeping stone giants - in the later game, you'll simply drool at the though of stone giant stew and extra strength...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n) Music&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings are reptiles, and all people know reptiles have a natural attunement to rhythm'n blues and stuff. They don't? Whatever, drakeling Barbarians still start out with this skill. It's only use is taming animals. To be able to tame animals with anything that resembles success, you need the skill at values of at least in the sixties, and it works reliably only at higher values, especially because a Barbarian has sucky Charisma. Considering a drakeling starts out at a single digit skill level and doesn't even have an instrument, it's immediately disqualified as an early game helper. Later on in the game, the only animal that is worth taming as a battle pet is a killer bug. Killer bugs can only be found if you have 100 entries in your high score list (i.e. 100 usually dead characters) and go to the bug-infested temple. They really are worthy of their name, and so can be helpful in dispatching all sorts of enemies even late in the game. Sadly, since you're not a bard, you always run a risk of your companions and pets turning on you. Do you want to get backstabbed by an extremely experienced killer bug? I tell you now: You DON'T. That's a powerful argument against the major use of Music. A minor use of the skill is that you can use tamed companions to kill cats without damaging your own kitty karma. Or you tame the cats themselves and let them be killed by monsters, whatever is more to your liking. If you want to invest in this skill at all with your drakeling, do it with a vengeance and spend some time practicing with your instruments so you can reach a halfway decent value, or don't do it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o) Pick Pockets&lt;br /&gt;This skill allows you to choose in which one of your pockets you should put an item you found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heh, heh. Yeah, bad joke, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even gnomes living in close relationship to basic nature's drives and with an inborn lust for combat, valour and honour don't seem to be able to renounce one of the bad habits of their race in general. If I ask you what you think you can do with Pick Pockets, the likely answer will be "Pick pockets, duh!"; but it's not that simple. What the Pick Pockets skill actually does in the game is create, in a mysterious and entirely magical way, an item out of thin air inside a monster's pocket, and steal it at the same time. This item can never weigh more than 10 stones. Inside the bounds of this restriction, all potions, scrolls, wands, amulets and rings and some other stuff are possible. Yes, that includes artifact rings and amulets like Preserver and the ring of immunity, and even the bracers of war. (And Soaker - but you don't want that artifact, as it's more like an artisucks) This means that every time you pickpocket a monster successfully you get an extra item you wouldn't have gotten otherwise. If you pickpocket ALL the monsters, you get so many more items than normal it's not even funny.&lt;br /&gt;The reason it works in that particularly strange way is probably closely connected to ADOM's development. In earlier versions of the game, monsters didn't have an inventory, meaning they couldn't pick up or even possess items themselves; when a goblin rockthrower, for instance, shot a rock at you, that rock didn't even exist for the game until it was shot, and the rocks and the sling and the random items that may appear if you kill the goblin rockthrower didn't exist before as well. Because monsters couldn't, technically, possess any items, the Pick Pockets skill could not actually steal items from the monsters. Instead, it created items itself to give the illusion that it stole items from the monsters. Before monster inventories, this was necessary as there was no other way for the Pick Pockets skill to work. Now that monster inventories have been implemented and monsters can pick up and hold items, the Pick Pockets skill still works in the old way instead of now finally stealing items the monsters actually have. Personally, I think it's an oversight of the Creator; he probably did not intend for the Pick Pockets skill to be used as a way to magically create items out of thin air. I don't think it should be forbidden to use the skill as winning is hard enough as it is in ADOM, but a victory managed only with the help of pickpocketing millions of useful items is, in my eyes, worth less than a victory earned with next to no use of the Pick Pockets skill.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one purpose for which even I will use the Pick Pockets skill; and that is the requirement for entry in the thieves guild. You have to pickpocket a number of about twenty-five people or monsters successfully before Yergius acknowledges your worth as a thief. This is acceptable even for me, as I will only gain three or four extra items or so (A successful use of the Pick Pockets skill will not always produce an item). Only members of the thieves guild can obtain a couple of useful skills. For Detect traps see above, for the others previously unknown to any kind of Barbarian, check out the next section. It's not necessary in any way to play gnomes to get Pick Pockets; if your PC is nonlawful, Yergius teaches it to you for free if you talk to him, even if you're only level 1.&lt;br /&gt;If you're like me, you'll only increase Pick Pockets as far as you need to manage entry into the thieves guild; if you want to exploit this skill (and again, I won't think less of you if you do, we all do what we have to do to win, except savescumming), level 100 can be achieved by your extensive training and skill increases, but isn't necessary, since even mith moderate skill values (such ones deemed "good" by the program) you get a very high success rate in pickpocketing your everyday monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p) Smithing&lt;br /&gt;Every dwarf is taught how to smith even their own children's toys and emerge very proficient in this skill with their adulthood. It's a very useful skill that can help you win the game greatly, but it requires a wide assortment of tools and material.&lt;br /&gt;The easiest requirement to meet is the hammer; any kind of hammer except maybe huge iron hammers and the hammer of the gods (Don't know for sure) will do. You'll find one of these soon and easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;The second tool is a lot harder to get: An anvil. It drops randomly next to never (which is as it should be; why would any monster lug an anvil around with him all the time?). There are two anvils guaranteed in the game; sadly, both already belong to someone else: Glod, the Dwarftown smith, and Kherab, the dwarven artificer, both have an anvil in their possession. You can, of course, kill them to get their anvils. Attacking Glod directly will lead to Dwarftown as a whole turning hostile on you, and Kherab will put up quite a fight - he hits hard and this with poisonous attacks. So unless you've already progressed pretty far in the game, only Glod is available. There are ways to rob him of his anvil without turning Dwarftown hostile. The easiest one is the use of the Ventriloquism skill: It will confuse Glod and turn him hostile, but no one else will notice you're the one who provoked him in the first place, and people will even defend you against him. Only gnomes have this option, however, everyone else will have to settle for another, more tedious method: Teleporting Glod out of his smithy and change positions with him until he can be lured off Dwarftwon through some stairs. Once he has left Dwarftown with you, you can kill him and take his anvil just like the evil chaotic bastard you are without anyone in Dwarftown noticing. This also removes him as a source of smithing-related services like mending items and weapons or removing the rust from them, though.&lt;br /&gt;The third main tool you need is a forge. Forges can be randomly found in dungeons. Guaranteed forges are found, again, only in Dwarftown with Glod or in Darkforge with Kherab. The latter is out of the question as smithing takes time and Darkforge is full of monsters and a corrupting area to boot. The former is, again, a little tricky. If you already lured Glod off the level to kill him and take his anvil, you won't have any problems, but as long as Glod is alive and in Dwarftown, he will charge you for using his forge - even if he is several houses away. Luring him off the level without killing him works already, though. Also, forges are not that rare - especially the Unremarkable Dungeon has a fair chance of one showing up, and is uncorrupting.&lt;br /&gt;No, we're not finished. Now that you have gathered the three tools and are ready to apply the Smithing skill, you can... remove rust. To do anything else, you need either ore that you can melt into ingots or ingots of the right metal that you can improve weapons and armour with. Ore is obtained by mining, and ingots by making them out of ore in addition to the few that are randomly found. To melt ore, apply Smithing and choose the ore. To improve an item, choose the item and then the ingot to improve it with (I'm not sure if you can do it the other way around). Provided you have the sufficient material, your smithing skill level is the only limit to how much you can improve a given item. If you have Smithing at 100 and even after several tries with your best effort improvement is impossible, you have reached the limit.&lt;br /&gt;So, to recap: A hammer, an anvil, a forge, and an ingot of the right metal is needed to improve an item, and you can melt ore to get the ingot. And even without ingots and ore, you can still remove rust without a potion of rust removal.&lt;br /&gt;Why go through all that hassle? It can be pretty much summed up like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: Crown of regeneration [+0, +0]&lt;br /&gt;(Spend hours of game time and a dozen iron ingots)&lt;br /&gt;After: Crown of regeneration [+9, +9]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced? Note that you don't have to be a dwarf to get Smithing, as Glod provides basic training in the skill for a fee - which, I'll admit, can be high. Dwarves only save the money, since because of the rarity of the smithing tools a dwarf is unlikely to be able to use Smithing before a PC of another race would reach Dwarftown and get it anyway. Once you're there, all you need to get the proper tools, if you're ready to be evil, is a wand of teleportation or the Ventriloquism skill. And a randomly found hammer, of course. Skill increases in Smithing need not take immediate priority, but Smithing should be at 100 by the time you plan to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this skill can lead to a ridiculously easy game, I wouldn't consider it too overly powerful since the tools are so hard and the material takes such a long time to get. So feel free to use it to your satisfaction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o) Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Gnomes have a knack for trickery and sleight of hand in general, and this particular skill is part of their repertoire. It allows you to confuse enemies. Confused enemies stagger around aimlessly and have a much harder time hitting you. Since apart from this skill, your only means to confuse enemies is by throwing your limited supply of potions of confusion at them, it's a nice skill to have. Success is directly related to skill value: anything in the lower range is unreliable at best, so if you want to use this skill on Ancient Chaos Wyrms or the like you'd better train it heavily. If you like this skill a lot, gnomish Barbarians might be just the thing for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;q) Acid Breath&lt;br /&gt;Drakelings have a special ability that allows them to spit globs of acid at their opponents. The strength of the avid produced depends directly on the character level of the drakeling. Instead of power points like a spell would, this ability consumes satiation; this means that if you're low on food already, you should refrain from using the Acid Breath. On the other hand, there are situations where a bloated character would love to lose his satiation so he can eat more stat-increasing corpses before they rot, like quickling or giant corpses.&lt;br /&gt;A drakeling Barbarian actually profits from his racial ability in all the cases where an opponent seems to be almost invincible to melee or missile attacks. Especially against doppleganger kings against whom you pretty much have to use spells, the Acid Breath can provide an alternative way of dealing damage. This racial ability is quite useful and a good argument for playing drakelings, though any race can obtain a nearly exact copy of this ability through the sulphur exhaling corruption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Mad skillz obtainable only the game&lt;br /&gt;Here are listed all the skills your Barbarian can only obtain in the game - at least those he can get without a wish or scroll/potion of education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Courage&lt;br /&gt;Normally, when your Barbarian (or any fighting class) is surrounded by more than two enemies, he starts getting penalties to his own to-hit, while his opponents gain boni to to-hit. This penalty becomes harder to bear the more enemies surround you. Courage helps decreasing that penalty. With Courage at 100, it becomes barely noticable. A smart player doesn't let him- or herself be surrounded, but in case it happens anyway (sometimes you're simply that unlucky, especially in cavernous levels), the Courage skill helps out greatly. Besides, a Barbarian should know Courage by virtue of being a Barbarian anyway, especially since the skill is taught by a barbarian: the old barbarian living in the clearing a bit north of Darkforge, in the middle of the forest to the south of the Drakalor chain. But first, you have to complete a quest (Duh! This is an RPG. You may be the only person capable of saving the world, but you still have to pay for your stuff and you don't get crucial abilities for free!). To even qualify for that quest, you first need to have killed 500 monsters. After you have obtained the quest, you need to kill twenty more of the monster that was your first kill. This is one of the main reasons why every player should try to remember his first kill. Was it a goblin? A kobold? An orc? A rat? A bandit if you were very smart? Anyway, after you've killed twenty of your first kill, you can return to him and he'll teach you sum'thin 'bout Courage. Note that he only talks to nonchaotics; if you're an evil bastard, he won't teach or give you squat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Disarm traps&lt;br /&gt;This skill allows you to use thieves picks to disarm traps. Since the only other thing that could do that is a spell, Barbarians actually need to have the skill to disarm traps, being the lousy spellcasters they are. However, to disarm a trap, you have to know where it is. And if you know where it is, why don't you just avoid it? Traps rarely go off if you have halfway decent Dexterity and Perception even if you step on them while knowing they are there. And if you don't have a high Disarm traps skill, chances are you trigger the trap yourself while disarming it (which only really hurts you if it's a fireball trap, though). The same can't be said, however, for door traps - almost all of them will hit you if you fail to disarm them badly. But door traps are easily disarmed by opening the door with an at least uncursed key or a wand of knocking. All in all, this skill is of low importance, so I'd advise you to keep the money it would cost to learn it from Yergius. (How to learn skills from Yergius is explained in the Pick Pockets description.) Note that thieves picks can be very rare; there are always some in the eastmost part of the first pyramid level, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Healing&lt;br /&gt;This skill is one of the first game objectives for a Barbarian. Its effect is simple: It increases HP regeneration enormously. The higher the skill level, the greater the effect. So no questions about it, you want this skill, and you want it badly. Two people can teach it to you: Jharod, the healer, and Kranf Niest, the mad doctor. Jharod will only teach the skill to you if you're nonchaotic and have proven "your ability to exert mercy". You can do that in two ways: First, you can lure Yrrigs all the way to Jharod, upon which Jharod will heal Yrrigs and reward you. Second, you can heal wounded monsters that have not been injured by yourself and are not hostile to you, for which Jharod will reward you as well. The reward is the Healing skill the first time, additional training in the Healing skill and a stethoscope the second time, and if Healing has already been maxed, you will still get a potion of ultra healing EVERY time you talk to him after having proven your ability to exert mercy. Niiice. (The catch is: Lacking the Healer class powers, you can only heal other people with the help of a Healing spell. Barbarians and spellcasting don't mix. Wands of wonder in combination with bookcasting Cure Light Wounds is about the only way to do it.)&lt;br /&gt;However, if you're chaotic and refuse to change your wicked ways, Jhared won't teach you Healing even after saving Yrrigs. Instead, you can complete Hotzenplotz' quest and kill Jharod. As a reward, Hotzenplotz will send you to Kranf Niest, who will experiment on you, draining a couple of stats - Willpower and Learning usually - and taking your headgear as well. The result is a Healing skill of just over sixty. However, that was it. You won't get further Healing increases, stethoscopes and potions of ultra healing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it's preferable to be nonchaotic and receive the skill from Jharod, even though you get the Healing skill at a lower value from him. However, you can't always become nonchaotic that easily early in the game. It's doable if you do the Kranach and/or puppy quest and lure Yrrigs to Jharod, but the easiest way is with a neutral or lawful altar. If you sacrifice gold one per piece, you'll reach neutral alignment with only four or five gold pieces. I advise doing this on higher character levels or after several conversions only while wearing at least one artifact or some expendable equipment (like clothes [+0,+0]) in case the gods get angry and want to destroy your equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the way you get Healing, you don't need to train it as it trains naturally, but it can help surviving the early game to spend a couple of skill increases on it. With this skill, you can regain hitpoints in a reasonable timeframe and can even afford waiting around in one place for your HP to maximize again without spending too much food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Law&lt;br /&gt;This skill makes you aware of chaotic and lawful deeds you just did. If you did something chaotic, the message is "You feel as if transgressing some law". If you did something lawful, the message is "You feel as if behaving in proper form". This skill is not very useful, because, honestly, with some brains and ADOM experience, you know that stuff yourself. Of course you are transgressing some law if you slaughter some innocent child or rob a grave! What also diminishes the usefulness of this skill is that it kicks in after you've already done what you did, and you can't make it undone. Still, you can learn for the future. The skill is not easy to get, however: You need to kill both Kranach and Hotzenplotz to be rewarded with the Law skill by Tywat Pare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Pick locks&lt;br /&gt;With this skill and thieves picks (see Disarm traps to know how to get them), you can open and close door locks. What sounds like a nice skill is actually not that useful once you think about it. There are two kinds of locked doors: Trapped ones and untrapped ones. The untrapped locked doors are easily kicked down. The trapped ones are the only ones for which Pick locks is of use. However, if you don't have a high Pick locks skill, the trap is likely to be sprung while unsuccessfully trying to open the door. Later on in the game, wands of knocking and keys take the place of Pick locks. Also, the Disarm traps skill can be used to disarm door traps, after which you can, again, simply kick down the door. This skill might be useful to use doors to hem in monsters without the appropriate key, but Barbarians probably have no desire to use such a cowardly tactic. Also, by the time you're likely to obtain thieves picks (they're rare as fuck), you should have an almost complete assortment of keys. This skill is probably not worth the money you have to pay Yergius for him to teach it to you. Still, it's your call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Tactics&lt;br /&gt;You need Leadership and Conscription for this. (Yeah, I know... I gotta stop this.) Fitting that a skill as valuable as this should close the list! A sound knowledge of tactics improves the benefits and decreases the penalties of non-normal tactics settings: Your berserking becomes more brutal (more to-hit and damage), but less reckless (more DV); your cowardice becomes more defensive (more DV), but less cowardly (more to-hit and damage). A Barbarian who knows how to use the tactics settings to his benefit can only profit from the Tactics skill, and this he can greatly, as the effect is considerable. The higher Tactics becomes, the less worthwhile it is to remain in the normal setting at all; even a change to normal aggressive or defensive tactics will become a good bargain in either direction - the normal defensive mode is wonderful in the endgame since it yields usually a two digit DV bonus for sacrificing only a slight amount of to-hit and damage. It's a question of playing style in general, but everyone benefits from this skill in some way, even if it's only the chance not to be hit by a greater titan's quarrel while running for your life in coward mode. That's why you should get it in any case. Like Backstabbing, this skill can be taught by Bart, the grizzled gladiator; you just have to give him the golden gladius - and it's well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Talents&lt;br /&gt;A very detailed and recommended section on talents is included in the guidebook. Here only my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get only one starting talent, you should choose either Alert or Strong of Will. For me it's Alert all the way for Treasure Hunter, but you may feel differently. With Strong of Will, you can become a Melee Weapon Master. Being a Melee Weapon Master adds 3 to melee damage and to hit. Nice enough. However, you have to invest heavily in it: It costs 7 talents including the starting talent. Thankfully, out of these seven prerequisites, at least four (if not more, since you could find several different kickass weapons for different situations) can be called useful. Only Strong of Will itself isn't very useful in any case.&lt;br /&gt;What is said about all the other talents in the guidebook applies. Just ignore Long Stride. Three reasons: First, you have Athletics, providing decent enough speed (If your speed sucks due to being bloated and strained, even Long Stride won't help...). Second, you get a class power at level 12 that makes Long Stride completely obsolete. Third and last, your Barbarian ain't a goddamn coward! If you want to be a bit faster before 12, choose the Quick talent early. After 12, the only thing that can make you even faster NOTICABLY are seven league boots.&lt;br /&gt;I can't decide on a single "best" talent set. Sometimes your early game problems dictate the talents you take in early levels.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind every Barbarian almost HAS TO take Basher, Powerful Strike and Mighty Strike, as all their crowning gifts (except for elves) are compatible with these. That especially holds true for those getting crowned with Vanquisher. While other heavy weapons may get six additional damage out of these talents, Vanquisher gets a whopping twelve against almost any enemy (and certainly all those of note), further amplified by berserk mode and tremendous blows to more than 36 extra damage with only three talents. Tasty, tasty damage... That's why I'd advise against choosing the shield talents until after your crowning: Getting Skullcrusher gives you entirely different preferences in that compared to getting Vanquisher. (For Grod, again what was said about Vanquisher applies - but it isn't that popular a weapon despite slaying powers.)&lt;br /&gt;Aggressive and Natural Berserker are also a decent choice if you find yourself using berserk tactics a fair deal, which admittedly I did. The extra 2 damage are amplified through tremendous blows. Six extra damage, twelve if you're using Vanquisher.&lt;br /&gt;Trolls and orcs suffer from their horribly short lifespans. Because of that, you might even consider to choose neither Alert nor Strong of Will, but Long-Lived. The loss of Treasure Hunter and Melee Weapon Master does suck a bit, though, so every trollish or orcish Barbarian LOVES that extra talent from Candle and Falcon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Average Melee Weapon Master Barbarian That Doesn't Want Treasure" (minimal talents):&lt;br /&gt;Strong of Will, Careful, Defensive Fighter, Quick, Affinity with Weapon One, Affinity with Weapon Two, Affinity with Weapon Three, Melee Weapon Master, Dodger, Very Quick, Greased Lightning, Porter, Master Packager, Beast of Burden, Basher, Powerful Strike, Mighty Strike.&lt;br /&gt;(Alternatives for the Porter or Basher chains are Good Shot, Keen Shot, Quick Shot. Also, Hardy, Tough Skin, Iron Skin and Steel Skin can be considered, especially if you're a dwarf and can get Mithril Skin as well - though that only leaves you with Porter, with minimal talents at least. The Shield talents may be a worthwhile alternative to the Porter talents.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Treasure Hunting Barbarian" (minimal talents):&lt;br /&gt;Alert, Miser, Treasure Hunter, Quick, Very Quick, Greased Lightning, Careful, Defensive Fighter, Dodger, Porter, Master Packager, Basher, Mighty Strike, Powerful Strike, Good Shot, Keen Shot, Quick Shot.&lt;br /&gt;(Again, it's worthwhile to choose the PV chain if you're a dwarf, and the Shield talents can be a worthwhile alternative)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Barbarian Going Both Ways" (two starting talents):&lt;br /&gt;Alert, Strong of Will, Miser, Treasure Hunter, Careful, Defensive Fighter, Affinity with Weapon One, Affinity with Weapon Two, Affinity with Weapon Three, Melee Weapon Master, Dodger, Quick, Very Quick, Greased Lightning, Porter, Master Packager, Beast of Burden, Free Slot.&lt;br /&gt;(I don't actually know what to insert in the free slot... Maybe you could sacrifice Master Packager and Beast of Burden and get the Basher, Shield Master or Good, Keen, Quick Shot line with the help of the free slot. Personally, I think you have too few talents left after going for Treasure Hunter AND Melee Weapon Master.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Hurthling Archer Barbarian (two starting talents):&lt;br /&gt;Alert, Miser, Treasure Hunter, Affinity with Bows, Affinity with Crossbows, Affinity with Slings Or Whatever, Good Shot, Keen Shot, Eagle-Eyed, Missile Weapon Master, Quick, Very Quick, Greased Lightning, Quick Shot, Lightning Shot, Porter, Master Packager, Beast of Burden.&lt;br /&gt;(Makes wonderful use of the Barbarian's missile weapon potential granted by the movement speed increase and the hurthling Archery skill. Downside? Obviously, no melee talents. However, if you sacrificed Missile Weapon Master and some Porter talents, you'd free four slots you could use on Careful, Defensive Fighter and Dodger, and maybe get the Basher and shield master talents. Every hurthling should, however, pick up Eagle-Eyed and Lightning Shot, AT LEAST the latter. If you can't spare talents for that, you're probably better off with another race.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barbarian heir gift is a brutal mithril two-handed sword. This weapon is capable of crushing anything in your path early on and might thus be worth to consider. A way to ensure getting three starting talents is playing a hurthling or gnomish Barbarian born in Candle or Falcon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Son of the Chieftain" (three starting talents):&lt;br /&gt;Charming, Boon to the Family, Heir... (Follow the "Treasure Hunting Barbarian" routine leaving out the Treasure Hunter talents obviously. You'll find other weapons later on, so choose the Basher talents or Shield master talents depending on the weapon found.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both hurthling and gnomish Barbarians can end up with four starting talents. A very rare gnome might even find himself with five. With four starting talents, you may choose Heir and follow either the Alert or the Strong of Will routine (while paying special attention to Basher talents, especially if your Son of the Chieftain ends up with Vanquisher!), or give up on Heir, choose a build that combines Alert and Strong of Will, making good use of the extra talents.&lt;br /&gt;With five starting talents (Should happen only once in a thousand, since even gnomes tend to start with mediocre Mana scores), you can even get Heir AND Alert AND Strong of Will - after which you'll have the "Barbarian Going Both Ways" build, if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IV. Equipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Melee weapons&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians don't need much to be successful, but every Barbarian that doesn't want to be crushed by the really dangerous opponents needs at least one melee weapon. They're dangerous in unarmed combat, of course, but unarmed combat for anyone but monks and beastfighters is like fighting with only a knife - it's doable, but far from the best way. Barbarians are strong by themselves, but their strength becomes game-winning strength only with a kickass melee weapon in their hand or both hands.&lt;br /&gt;However, the melee weapon is only one part of a Barbarian's battle prowess in melee: much greater is the influence of the weapon skill. Even the mightiest sword is not worth very much if your Barbarian still has to find out which end to hold and which to stick into monsters. If you want to become really powerful with a weapon, you have to train in it. A Barbarian that wants to achieve mastery in all the weapon classes, however, would have to play for a very, very long time, but the first levels are very quickly achieved in general.&lt;br /&gt;In the early game, you should use the weapon that deals the most damage, taking your weapon skill into account. If you're already pretty skilled with your old weapon, using that instead of a newly found weapon with slightly higher damage and to-hit is better. But if the new weapon manages to be better even when taking the weapon skill into account, I'd use it, especially considering how quick you can achieve the first three levels or so in weapon skill.&lt;br /&gt;However, sooner or later you'll find an artifact weapon. And some artifact weapons are more powerful than a "regular" weapon could ever hope to be.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here's a list of the weapon classes. I'll give you a general evaluation of that weapon class, as some offer better weapons than others, and are thus more likely to be of use in the end of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Unarmed fighting&lt;br /&gt;Rating: poor&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: Your bare hands and feet&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the basher talents: None&lt;br /&gt;Hands: Depends. You can fight bare-handed, wearing only one shield, or wear two shields and kick your opponents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been stated, unarmed fighting isn't a very worthwhile endeavour for a Barbarian. It only does damage like a dagger or knife would, and this without a single magical property. While on Grand Mastery the DV offered isn't bad, Polearm, whip or staff (not to mention shield) DV is superior, and these classes offer some powerful weapons. It's cool to kill diamond golems in unarmed combat and a level 50 Barbarian can certainly pull it off, but your chances against the most powerful opponents in the game look grim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Daggers and Knives&lt;br /&gt;Rating: medium&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium dagger, dagger of death, phase dagger, orcish dagger (bloody), Emerald Bite, Needle and Sting&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Practically nonexistant. Only "heavy" prefixes might work.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: 100% one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll admit it doesn't look very Barbarian-like, but daggers and knives are actually not that bad a weapon class to train in. Compared to other weapon classes, daggers and knives will always deal a bit less damage, sure, but there are very useful and powerful weapons in this class. First, Emerald Bite, a poisonous humanoid slayer with a higher chance to score critical hits. Second, the phase dagger, a weapon that bypasses PV. It should be noted, however, that PV is less of a problem for Barbarians than it would be for other melee classes because of the tremendous blow class power. Also, the magical suffix "of penetration" has the same effect and can appear on any melee weapon on any class. Still, phase daggers are the only PV-bypassing weapon that can be wished for. The other two very powerful daggers are the rune-covered twin daggers Needle and Sting. These can't be obtained until late in the game, however, and if you do get them both, they become so powerful dagger weapon skill isn't an issue. To sum it up, I wouldn't call it a waste to train in this weapon skill because of the phase daggers, and I highly recommend specializing in it should you find Emerald Bite, which you can be precrowned with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Clubs and Hammers&lt;br /&gt;Rating: medium&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium warhammer, large eternium hammer, Skullcrusher&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Not all that bad because of Skullcrusher. Hammer of the gods, iron-made large hammers and huge iron hammers qualify, but aren't that worthwhile to use.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: huge iron hammers and hammer of the gods two-handed, rest one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weapon class isn't spectacular. The only decent clubs and hammers in the game are either eternium-made or Skullcrusher. A case could be made for the hammer of the gods, but I feel it doesn't compensate for its two-handedness and rarity enough. Skullcrusher, a humanoid slayer with a nice strength bonus, is the reason why Clubs and Hammers still gets a decent rating from me, as it is a crowning gift for the Barbarian - one with a 33% (28% for elves) chance to get at that. It can also be found randomly, and thus be obtained with precrowns. If the result of your crowning is not Skullcrusher and you don't seem to be able to find it, however, I advise against fighting with clubs or hammers too long. Exchange your large eternium hammer for a better weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Maces and Flails&lt;br /&gt;Rating: medium&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium flail, mace of destruction, mace of disruption, Purifier, Big Punch&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: High, Purifier, Big Punch and the magical maces qualify; eternium flail does not.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: All the halfway decent weapons are one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weapon class is not spectacular, but not that bad either. Maces of destruction and eternium flails are damage-dealers and otherwise not out of the ordinary. Big Punch deals even more damage than these and is a weapon you are guaranteed to get as the quest reward for doing the last Thrundarr quest, but it's heavy as hell. Maces of disruption don't deal a lot of damage, but are undead slayers and can come in handy against these, but mostly their base damage is too low to justify using them otherwise. The only weapon of this weapon class that really shines is Purifier. It slays Undead, Demon and Constructs (Unlife). This means it works against balors, which is always nice, and several other dangerous end-game opponents. However, with its low base damage and the fact it doesn't slay humanoids, it's not the best artifact weapon - and on top of that, very rare. If you do find yourself using maces and flails, don't forget to get the Basher talents, as almost any mace or flail that is worth using gets extra damage from it. The reason this class gets a relatively good rating is the damage flails tend to deal, which is greater than that of broadswords or battle axes made from the same metal. Maces of destruction (and Big Punch) surpass swords of sharpness in raw damage and are compatible with the basher talents. Still, maces and flails are somewhat less plenty than swords in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Swords&lt;br /&gt;Rating: medium&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium long sword, scimitar and broadsword, sword of sharpness&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Practically non-existant, see daggers and knives&lt;br /&gt;Hands: 100% one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A classic of any RPG. You can't go wrong with swords, right? Actually, in this case it's not that good an idea. Barbarians aren't crowned with swords that actually belong to the Swords class, and the artifact swords that can be gotten aren't that useful. The golden gladius is okay, but you need the Tactics skill you can only get if you give it away. The sword of Nonnak does pitiful damage - it's only useful to spellcasters because of the willpower bonus. Justifier, the most powerful sword of all, is probably not available to any but those that can be crowned with it, and Barbarians aren't among them. Still, swords of sharpness are among the most powerful single-handed melee weapons that are not artifacts, and higher metal swords in general are pretty easy to find especially early on. This weapon class is good early on, but it tops out somewhere in the mid game in its usefulness. That's why you should probably switch sometime earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Axes&lt;br /&gt;Rating: medium&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium battle axe, Rolf's Companion, Executor, Hammerhead&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Very low. Only orcish battle axes and stone axes apply, and they're pretty weak.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: 100% one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you see in your mind first if you hear the word "Barbarian"? A big motherfuckin' axe, exactly. Actually, the Big Motherfuckin' Axe (or great axe, or axe of the minotaur emperor) is not a part of the Axes weapon class - it's part of the two-handed weapons class. These are the axes that you can wield in one hand. This weapon class is actually not bad as there are good artifact weapons for it. Rolf's Companion can be obtained by lawful characters in dwarftown, Executor and Hammerhead have to be randomly found. Hammerhead and Rolf's Companion are very similar in power, but Executor is what makes this weapon class really shine: It slays humanoids and demons! The fact that it curses you is only a minor setback if you consider the humanoid slaying, probably the most useful slaying power of all. Of course, if you don't find Executor, axes are like swords: Mediocre in the end, good to use until the mid game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Whips&lt;br /&gt;Rating: poor&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: whip of the snake, whip of slaughtering&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Practically non-existant.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: 100% one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weapon class is pretty horrible. Whips of the snake and of slaughtering are the only worthwhile weapons to use, and they are very rare. Even if you find them, they are quite a lot weaker than good artifact weapons and some eternium-made weapons of other weapon classes, and there are no artifact whips. Whips do offer a nice DV bonus, but the one the pole arms class offers is greater. So in general, unless you love doing things the exotic way or role-play Indiana Jones, don't use whips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Pole arms&lt;br /&gt;Rating: medium (good if born in Raven)&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium spear, eternium halberd, Wyrmlance, rune-covered trident, Trident of the Red Rooster&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Low, Trident of the Red Rooster is the only powerful weapon that applies.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: Fifty-fifty, the most powerful pole arms tend to require two hands to wield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weapon class would be a lot better if the Trident of the Red Rooster weren't such a pain to get. Even so, the rune-covered trident - available as a quest reward to all characters that reach level 36, or even 16 if they're Raven - is a very nice weapon since it slays undead and demons and deals pretty awesome damage. Most notably, it's effective against balors on D:50: If you are capable of defeating the balors on D:50, winning the game is pretty easy. A Raven-born Barbarian should actually try to get this weapon as early as possible: as soon as at least two uses of on-demand teleportation and a ring of the fish (or helm of water breathing) are found.&lt;br /&gt;For most PCs, below level 36 you simply don't get very powerful pole arms save for a randomly found Wyrmlance. Eternium spears are a powerful combination with shields because of the DV bonus a high pole arms skill yields: You won't deal the enormous assloads of damage you could get with other weapons (though it's still assloads because of tremendous blow), but you'll be hit much less often. None of your crowning weapons, however, is part of this weapon class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Two-handed weapons&lt;br /&gt;Rating: good&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium two-handed sword, Vanquisher, Grod, axe of the minotaur emperor&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Alright, higher metal two-handed swords do not qualify, the artifacts do.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: Two. Duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who already wet their pants at the thought of wielding a big motherfuckin' axe, I have to disappoint you: The great axe isn't spectacular. It's almost equal to the two-handed sword in power - the iron two-handed sword. Higher metal two-handed swords are the two-handed weapons to use in the later game. Except, of course, you plan on using the axe of the minotaur emperor. Remember, however, how much of a pain in the ass the Minotaur Maze is for non-spellcasters.&lt;br /&gt;Two-handed weapons might not be the best weapon class for anybody, but I think it's the best for Barbarians. That's because two-handed weapons deal the greatest raw damage of all - Needle &amp;amp; Sting aside. The higher your damage output, the greater effect will tremendous and mighty blows have. The two-handed weapons weapon skill itself assists this even more due to its unequalled damage bonus (Over thirty points of extra damage on Grand Mastery!). And then there is Vanquisher, which a non-elven Barbarian has a 33% chance to get, and there is Grod, obtainable with a 16% chance. There's a whopping 66% chance for your crowning gift to be a two-handed weapon in general (though Death's Blade is hardly superior to an eternium two-handed sword). Vanquisher is the wet dream of any Barbarian due to it's power of slaying almost ANYTHING, and Grod offers nice base damage, immunity to fire, higher critical chances, and at least giant and demon slaying. Even if your crowning gift doesn't turn out this way, an eternium two-handed sword is powerful enough to be used with success until the very endgame, especially if you find one with certain magical properties (penetration or devastation spring to mind). Still, Skullcrusher with a shield is probably better as long as you don't find one with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Staves&lt;br /&gt;Rating: poor&lt;br /&gt;Good weapons: eternium-shod quarterstaff, quicksilver quarterstaff&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility with the Basher talents: Practically non-existant.&lt;br /&gt;Hands: 100% two-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the weapon classes, this one offers the highest DV bonus. Nice? Pointless, as it doesn't make up for the lack of being able to wear a shield. A good single-handed weapon with a good shield will always be better than any staff. Investing weapon skill training in this weapon skill is probably a waste. Except in the case that you stumble across an eternium-shod quarterstaff in the small cave or something, don't fight with a staff. Certain magical staves might be worthwhile to use for a spellcasting character, but you're a Barbarian!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Missile weapons&lt;br /&gt;Why does a Barbarian need missile weapons? Well, first of all, you can't use spells. So what happens if you encounter an opponent that you can't engage in melee? Karmic lizards? Master swordsmen and ratling duelists with their nasty habit of disarming you? Hotzenplotz with his poisonous melee attacks? Fleeing enemies that are faster than you? You can use wands against most of these enemies, granted. But wands and the booze to recharge them with don't grow on trees. So there is no good excuse not to use some sort of missile weapon.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a second incentive to use missile weapons, especially bows and crossbows, and that is slaying ammunition. With "slaying ammunition", I refer to arrows and quarrels that have the power to slay a certain type of monster: "arrow of dragon slaying" for instance. These are randomly dropped by monsters frequently, and almost always come in bundles. And their power is obvious: They can, when supported by decent dexterity and missile weapon skill, slay the thing they're supposed to slay a lot better than your melee attack could - except, of course, if your melee weapon also "slays", but only artifacts (and maces of disruption for undead and rabbit knives for battle bunnies) can do that. And on top of that, slaying ammunition can slay from afar - and the more powerful opponents have usually devastating melee attacks or eat your stats as if they're pizza. Some, if not most, don't have distance attacks at all, meaning you simply get powerful free hits with your missile attack.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, when you encounter an opponent, normally you have to run up to him or hit "5" until he is next to you so you can use your melee weapon. But isn't that time better spent shooting some missiles at your enemy in berserk mode to soften him up for the melee fight?&lt;br /&gt;So, we've established you want to use missile attacks, and I've given you a very good reason to use bows and crossbows. And I mean bows AND crossbows. Specializing in one of them means better damage of course, but I promise you that you won't find all the kinds of slaying ammunition for only one of these. What will you do if you train in bows only and engage an ancient karmic dragon and suddenly find out that all your dragon slaying ammunition comes in quarrels? Bite yourself in the ass, that's what. Train both weapons with the normal ammunition you find, the first levels in the missile weapon skills are very easy to obtain and already help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Slings, no (unless you're a gnome in the early game). Throwing weapons, hell no (Except, maybe, boomerangs of slaying or something like that, or to become a throwing spears specialist to prepare for the rune-covered trident). Missile attacks play a supporting role for your Barbarian, and bows and crossbows give the best support. Hurthling Barbarians have the added advantage that they get the most powerful missile attacks of any Barbarian, making them all the better at the described uses of missile attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Armor&lt;br /&gt;Some dismiss wearing armor as a sign of weakness. "Some" tend to die pretty easily. You should be smarter and wear the best armor you can find. There are two kinds of armor values: DV and PV. You become harder to hit the higher your DV is, and every time you are hit, the damage caused is reduced by your PV value except for the cases where monsters punch through your armor, as claw bugs do. PV is the more useful armor value in the early game. A PV of 10 or higher makes you invincible against the attacks of puny goblins and rats, and you won't feel much even from orc chieftain or kobold chieftain attacks. If you manage to get a PV value of 15 or higher, you can consider yourself very well protected for early game purposes. So in the early game, the PV value of the armor dictates its worth.&lt;br /&gt;As the game progresses, monsters deal higher base damage, and thus their criticals add even more damage. Critical hits by monsters do not bypass PV, however - they simply deal double damage. Simply? Check the maths regarding monster PV for tremendous blows again - the effect of dealing multiplied damage. Well, the same applies for monsters against you! When your PV is, say, 50 (a realistic endgame value), and a monster can deal a maximum of 50 damage normally, normally you'd think you can sit there and laugh at its puny attempts to hurt you. But if that monster deals a critical hit with maximum damage, you lose 50 hitpoints. That's a lot - enough to kill you depending on the circumstances, after all, the monster could have several attacks and luck out with these as well, or you could be fighting several opponents at once, or already be pretty hurt!&lt;br /&gt;The more powerful the attacks of the monsters become, the less reliable is PV, and as a consequence the more valuable becomes DV. When you become harder to hit, you will suffer less hits in general, and thus criticals. And if you do get hit, a reasonable PV value allows you to absorb most of that damage as well. A good combination of high DV and PV is what you want in the endgame, but it doesn't matter all that much whether your PV is 30 or 50 if you have a DV of 90.&lt;br /&gt;Berserk mode lowers DV, but due to the fact that monsters are destroyed more quickly in it you're hit about as or even less often as you would have been in normal mode, especially with a high Tactics skill. But with a lousy DV from equipment, your Barbarian will still be hit too often, berserk mode or not - except, of course, you avoid to be even attacked thanks to attacking and movement speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For PV, it's pretty easy: Higher metals offer better protection. Better DV mostly isn't gained from armor parts (though some high quality armor parts give DV boni), but higher metal body armor doesn't have as high DV penalties. Shields are the most effective source of DV. In the case of shields, I consider DV the more important property in the long run (again, in the very early game, every extra point of PV helps survival): A [+11, +2] shield is better than a [+9, +4] shield. This is because of the special relationship the DV of your shield has with the shield weapon skill: Even if your shield skill would allow for a higher gain, the maximum DV gained by the skill is equal to double the DV bonus of your current shield. Your endgame shield should be either a eternium or crystal tower shield or the artifact shield Protector (or maybe the shield of raw steel - though that should be considered toying with fire!).&lt;br /&gt;Another thing: If you want the absolute supreme armor in DV/PV terms, the Smithing skill is your ultimate tool, as it can improve any kind of metal gear by a very large margin - BOTH DV and PV. Check the skill description for more information.&lt;br /&gt;Scrolls of defense and protection should always be preserved for those parts of your armor that can't be smithed and are pretty low on DV and PV already. Seven league boots or magical girdles (Like girdles of giant strength) are good examples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Magical equipment&lt;br /&gt;There is a large assortment of magical items to be found in the game. Some are of great use to a Barbarian. Since Barbarians are usually illiterate for quite some time, there is a need for wield-identifying (equipping items to see what they do). This doesn't always work, is not generally a safe thing to do, and for some kinds of items, it can be potentially fatal. The risk of being stuck with a cursed item can be considerably lowered by determining the status of an item before wield-identifying it, which can be done by dropping the item on a coaligned altar. If an item is uncursed or blessed, you will be able to unequip it again safely unless that item is auto-cursing. Auto-cursing items are rare, and for some types of items there are none at all, making it safe to equip these once you know they aren't cursed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Rings&lt;br /&gt;Rings of slaying are very desirable, as the six points of melee damage added by them multiplies when you take berserk mode and tremendous blows into consideration: the effect is equal to the effect of the Basher talent PLUS Good Shot, Keen Shot and Eagle Eye (to-hit increases of those aside)! There is a lot of other possibilities for ring slots, and sometimes using a certain ring is simply a necessity. Early on in the game, rings you find will not be even identified for quite some time. Wield-identifying is generally not advisable, as it is possible to find yourself crushed by tons of luggage due to equipping a ring of weakness, and you may get yourself stuck with rings of doom (very nasty) or of the fish, which both autocurse as well. However, the majority of rings is harmless; though any ring can be cursed and force you to wear them until water can be blessed or scrolls of uncursing can be read. Other useful rings include the ring of teleport control (almost essential if you don't have it as an intrinsic thanks to a pool or blink dog corpses, useless if you do), artifact rings like the ring of the High Kings, the ring of the Master Cat or the ring of immunity, rings of mental stability or speed (especially if they are of high quality) and other, specialized rings depending on the situation. (It's good to remember those two rings of acid resistance in your pack when you see an acid vortex heading right towards you, and the ring of see invisible is the only non-artifact item that grants that particular intrinsic.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Amulets&lt;br /&gt;You'll find yourself changing amulets pretty often during a game. The reason for that is the wide variety of amulets that grant special resistances. While rings offer mostly elemental, stun and confusion resistance, petrification, paralyzation and death ray resistance is restricted to amulets. Pick up any amulet you find. When you encounter a gorgon, switch to petrification resistance. When you encounter a mimic or dorn beast, switch to free action. When you encounter Nuurag-Vaarn, an emperor lich or a ki-rin, switch to death ray resistance. Of course, if you have these resistances from another source, you can use other amulets in the amulet slot. The ankh is a nice choice if only for the added luck and the DV/PV offered. Amulets of speed offer a small advantage, as is true for most of the other amulets. You should only wear an amulet of life saving, if you have one, before a great battle, it can be destroyed too easily by traps if you use it for everyday exploring. If you're really lucky, though, you'll find Preserver, and then you'll never want to change your amulet again ever.&lt;br /&gt;Early game Barbarians should remember that amulets of light are always glass amulets, and are very useful for exploring those dark rooms and adding to your range of sight. For all other amulets note that there is one amulet with a negative effect, which also autocurses - one that can slowly kill early game PCs: amulets of hunger. Wield-identifying thus carries risks. There is one other autocursing amulet - but you should be aware of its dangerous nature after having seen what it has done to its previous owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Helmets&lt;br /&gt;Helms of mental stability increase Learning, a semi-important stat for Barbarians, and grant confusion resistance, an important intrinsic. Helms of water breathing are only really useful in the water cave. Helms of teleportation let you randomly teleport, which is nice if you want to save your on-demand teleportation sources for emergencies. Crowns of regeneration are very powerful, but vulnerable to fire. Red, white and blue crowns offer elemental immunities for special occasions. All of these except helms of mental stability can be smithed to your liking! Wield-identifying headgear carries next to no risk - the worst that can happen is that you get stuck with a cursed low-qualitiy helm stuck on your head. There are no auto-cursing helms (safe for two artifact crowns found late in the game, which also both doom, so take care), so feel free to wield-identify all the helms you know aren't cursed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Girdles&lt;br /&gt;The best girdle in the game is the girdle of giant strength. It has only one weakness: It can be easily destroyed, especially by fire. And suddenly losing 12 or more points of strength from one moment to the other is something not all PCs can deal with. Still, Barbarians LOVE strength. The regular girdle of strength is probably not worth it compared to a higher metal girdle. Girdles of carrying are very useful, but have the same weakness as the girdle of giant strength. Girdles of greed are useful in the Casino, and if you have at least the Porter talents, you can use a certain exploit to increase your carrying capacity to the potentially unlimited: Blessed girdles of greed increase your carrying capacity by the exact weight of your gold. However, Porter talents increase the capacity AFTER this has happened, meaning that girdles of greed actually yield a net gain in carrying capacity the more gold you carry: If your carrying capacity were 2000 without gold or blessed girdle of greed, but you have Porter, wearing 100 stones in gold with a blessed girdle of greed would increase your carrying capacity to 2121, meaning you can wear 21 stones more in total. Wearing 1000 stones in gold increases carrying capacity to 3300 (300 extra), 10000 stones in gold to 13200 (1200 extra), 2 billion stones in gold to 2 billion, 200 million and 2000 (2.200.002.000) stones, meaning you have 200 million stones of carrying capacity more to fill! However, you can easily predict what will happen should your girdle of greed be destroyed while exploiting this trick. Money belts, finally, are next to useless - if anyone ever steals from you, just kill him and take your gold back. You should refrain from wield-identifying girdles in any case. Not only can cursed girdles of carrying and cursed girdles of weight hamper your progress greatly: if your girdle is cursed, you can't change your body armor anymore, not even equip one after the old has been damaged or destroyed! However, it's safe to wield-identify girdles you know aren't cursed, as there are no autocursing girdles. Note that magical girdles cannot be smithed, only the metal girdles - which are usually non-magical - can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Cloaks&lt;br /&gt;Cloak have the annoying habit of not lasting too long, as they can all be destroyed by fire, water, lightning, acid or monster hits. The only truly magical cloak is the cloak of invisibility, and in some places it is a tremendous asset. Do not wear it constantly since it consumes food very quickly (and is, as has been stated, easily destroyed). Wield-identifying cloaks is safe - The worst that can happen is a cursed cloak with negative properties, and even that one will not be on your shoulders for long thanks to cloaks high vulnerability to item destruction. Cloaks cannot be smithed, but don't invest scrolls of defense or protection in them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Bracers&lt;br /&gt;If you find the bracers of war, the question of how to use this slot is settled. If you don't, it's not that tough of a decision either. Bracers of regeneration are probably the best. Bracers of toughness come on the next place. Bracers of resistance are pretty nice, as are bracers of speed, bracers of defense or protection are the most basic and least useful of the bracers. Except for bracers of toughness and brass bracers (and, obviously, the bracers of war), all bracers can be smithed. Bracers in general are rare and wield-identifying is harmless (no auto-cursing, no negative effects), that's why I usually equip the first pair of bracers I find (except for brass bracers, as they have no effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Gauntlets&lt;br /&gt;The best gauntlets for a Barbarian are gauntlets of strength, especially Ironfist. A pair of artifact gauntlets in general (if not Ironfist, then the elemental gauntlets, which are also very useful) has the added advantage that it protects your rings from harm. Only divine forces can destroy rings that are hidden under an artifact gauntlet. Dragon-hide gauntlets offer useful resistances. Gauntlets that are made of iron can be smithed. These include any kind of dragon-hide gauntlets, normal gauntlets, gauntlets of strength and gauntlets of peace (presumably). There are no gauntlets made of other metals than iron. Wield-identifying gauntlets is risky. While there are no gauntlets that cause you direct harm if you equip them, you can become stuck with auto-cursing gauntlets of peace, which are indistinguishable from normal gauntlets while unidentified. Also, being stuck with cursed gauntlets means you can't equip or unequip rings, a restriction almost as severe as the one a cursed girdle has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Boots&lt;br /&gt;Seven league boots are probably the best boots you could ever want, even though the Barbarian class power on level 12 is a good replacement for them. Apart from the seven leagues, there is only one type of magical boots that can be of use: Boots of speed. Their speed bonus is significant. The dexterity bonus of the boots of sneakiness is nice, but not really that useful. Apart from these two, you can pretty much only wear non-magical boots for their armor ratings. Metal boots can be smithed, and they come in all metals. Wield-identifying boots is a pretty harmless endeavour - the boots that can have negative effects are pretty easily recognized by their weights: Boots of the slow shuffle, though they are auto-cursing and have a very negative effect, always weigh 40 stones and are ridiculously rare, seven leagues weigh 30 stones and are either leather, soft or worn boots weighing 30 stones. When equipping worn boots you don't know the status of, you should have holy water handy, as cursed seven leagues are actually very harmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Shields&lt;br /&gt;There are no magical shields except for artifact shields. The question of which shield to wear is thus solely one of DV and PV. Of the artifact shields, Protector is as powerful as Nature's Friend is useless. The shield of raw steel, a possible quest reward from Kherab, is very powerful, but contains the essence of chaos and corruption, making it a dangerous item to use. Shields can be smithed, except for wooden, crystal and artifact ones. Wield-identiying shields is not recommended since it is mostly unnecessary. You can recognize the metal from the weight of the shield in relation to its type (small, medium, large, tower): Iron small shields weigh 50 stones, for example. So if you find a small shield that weighs less, you know that it's made of a higher metal, and if you find a small shield weighing more, it has to be made of crystal. Some crystal shields are as powerful as the eternium variety of the shield type, some only live up to the adamantium variety. All crystal shields are better than their mithril counterparts, though. Wield-identifying shields is not that risky, but being stuck with an inferior shield when a better one is found can hurt a lot. If you know the shield isn't cursed, however, you can freely test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Body armor&lt;br /&gt;Dragon scale mails are probably best if available, due to their high armor value coupled with a useful immunity. Except for artifact armor, there are no other inherently magical armors. High-end body armor can pretty much always be smithed (dragon scale mail can as well, most notably - adamantium), artifact armor being the notable exception. The robes of resistance and Nature's Companion are pretty powerful armors despite this weakness. Smithing armor helps mostly with DV. Wield-identifying armor is not advisable, as body armor is a pretty important part of your equipment and potentially being stuck with cursed armor is not something you want, especially since there is a variety of nasty random magical effects for body armor (such as worm-ridden, charged, trapped, or auto-locking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Crowning gifts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians can only get one of four artifacts as crowning gifts, five if elven. Two of these, Vanquisher and Skullcrusher, have double the probablity to become your new shiny toy. Let's look at these babies closer, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Vanquisher&lt;br /&gt;1 in 3 chance to get for non-elves, 2 in 7 for high/gray elves&lt;br /&gt;+3 to-hit, 6d5+3 damage, -3 DV, slays humanoids, giants, undead, constructs, demons, dragons and jelly&lt;br /&gt;Twohanded Weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silvery two-handed sword, the only two-handed sword weighing 300 stones, is the wet dream of every Barbarian in the whole wide world. Sure, its base damage and to-hit is highly inferior to, say, an eternium two-handed sword, but look at its slaying properties. Remember that "slaying" means "double damage". And "double damage" refers to total damage, not only the damage of Vanquisher itself. All your strength, your melee damage increasing talents, your weapon skill damage boni, magical items that increase damage, berserk mode, tremendous blow, Backstabbing bonus - all that is DOUBLED if you use Vanquisher against the kinds of opponents it slays. And pretty much the only thing of note it doesn't slay is animals, and by the time you can get crowned, there is not a single animal that wouldn't fall before you, Vanquisher or not. With this weapon, your Barbarian is a devastating demigod of death and destruction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Skullcrusher&lt;br /&gt;1 in 3 chance to get for non-elves, 2 in 7 for high/gray elves&lt;br /&gt;+12 to-hit, 3d6+2 damage, -3 DV, slays humanoids, +4 strength, resistance to stunning and confusion&lt;br /&gt;Clubs and Hammers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rune-covered club weighing 120 stones isn't too hot when it comes to raw damage. Actually, it's even pretty bad in that regard. However, you get four extra points of strength directly translating to more damage, you get the humanoid slaying power, which works against quite a number of opponents, and the weapon is Basher-compatible. This weapon is especially nice to have against Nuurag-Vaarn, as he tries to confuse you very frequently and several sources of confusion resistance increase your chance not to be affected. Also, Nuurag-Vaarn is humanoid, as are balors and Andor Drakon, incidentally. It might not be the perfect weapon for use against anything, but it's not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Grod&lt;br /&gt;1 in 6 chance to get for non-elves, 1 in 7 for high/gray elves&lt;br /&gt;+16 to-hit, 5d10+5 damage, -8 DV, slays giants and demons, higher critical chance, resistance to stunning, immunity to fire&lt;br /&gt;Twohanded Weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;220 stones is the weight of the mighty morning star, a two-handed weapon which is also part of the two-handed weapon class. In raw damage and to-hit, it surpasses Vanquisher. Its DV penalty is hefty, though. Also, while Vanquisher slays everything, Grod slays only demons and giants, not humanoids. The higher critical chance and the raw damage makes it dangerous in melee nonetheless, and the immunity to fire is a nice gimmick. Grod is more powerful than an eternium two-handed sword taking the higher critical chance and the compatibility with the Basher talents into account, and it can easily destroy balors on D:50, making it worthwhile to use. It lacks the "Kill 'em all" feeling of Vanquisher, though, and it hurts your chances in defense with its -8 to DV. All in all, an okay crowning gift, but I'd be more grateful for Vanquisher, Skullcrusher or even Sun's Messenger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Death's Blade&lt;br /&gt;1 in 6 chance to get for non-elves, 1 in 7 for high/gray elves&lt;br /&gt;+6, 6d8+6 damage, +4 DV, resistance to death rays&lt;br /&gt;Twohanded Weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heaviest of the crowning gifts at 400 stones, the ancient claymore "Death's Blade" is also the relatively worst. Its damage-dealing capabilities in comparison to a run-of-the-mill eternium two-handed sword don't look that hot, unless you have the Basher talents to support it with. (The math: Average eternium two-handed sword deals 24-48 damage averaging 36, Death's Blade 12-52 averaging 32, which can be increased to 38 with the Basher talents.) And while it has 12 lower to-hit, it somewhat makes up for that with five more DV and the death ray resistance. If Death's Blade is only slightly better than an eternium two-handed sword, how does it look compared to Grod and Vanquisher with their slaying powers? Death ray resistance may be more easily acquired with an amulet or the ancient mummy wrapping. It's not as horrible an artifact as, say, Soaker or Bugbiter, but it certainly isn't a reason to jump around in circles. Depending on your item finding luck, you could find yourself with nothing better to use, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Sun's Messenger&lt;br /&gt;1 in 7 chance for high/gray elves only&lt;br /&gt;+15 to-hit and damage, slays undead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering why the elven long bow deserves a spot in this list? All high and gray elves, regardless of their class, can be crowned with Sun's Messenger, so if you ended up playing one of these races with your Barbarian, you may find yourself with this. Since Barbarians love to use bows and crossbows alike (as has been explained in an earlier section), they don't sneer at this masterpiece of elven craftsmanship, but cherish it! Powerful undead can show up anytime, and the +15 to-hit and damage far surpass anything a non-artifact bow can dish out. Say goodbye to those pesky emperor liches as your blessed eternium arrows shoot forth from this wonder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Items to wish for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the items already mentioned in the previous sections (the good weapons for each class, the magical equipment like the girdle of giant strength or seven league boots) there is, naturally, a couple of very good choices for a wish. Like in the Archer guide, this should be taken as a general pool of ideas - except the first wish mentioned, which is very much worth it. Again, if you wish for items, always try to wish for them in plural - "pairs of" is the plural for gauntlets and boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "Amulet of life saving", for the dying sage (Remember: Six blessed scrolls of chaos resistance 4 U!)&lt;br /&gt;- "scrolls of chaos resistance", if you're paranoid (and have reason to be)&lt;br /&gt;- "Find Weakness", if you don't have it and didn't get Vanquisher (Vanquisher makes Find Weakness obsolete)&lt;br /&gt;- "Concentration", if you want to dabble in spellcasting affairs (but I don't make any guarantees that you'll be successfull)&lt;br /&gt;- "scrolls of education", if you want to get lots of new skills (bless them!)&lt;br /&gt;- "magical writing sets", should you have seen scrolls of education or of chaos resistance and want to make more&lt;br /&gt;- "Alchemy", though it's folly to obtain it if you can't max it in time for the PoGA recipe&lt;br /&gt;- "wands of destruction" for an easier time on D:50&lt;br /&gt;- "rings of ice" for an easier time in the Tower of Eternal Flames&lt;br /&gt;- ultra ending stuff&lt;br /&gt;- "potions of quickling blood" (yummy speed)&lt;br /&gt;- "potions of youth" (if you've been raped by ghost lords)&lt;br /&gt;- "potions of strength" (bless them both and gulp them down for four permanent extra points of strength)&lt;br /&gt;- "maces of destruction" in case you want a powerful, basher-compatible one-handed melee weapon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Barbarian vs. Boss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Keethrax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the hell are you fighting against Keethrax? You already have Herbalism and the black torc is shit, Healing is what you would have needed! Sigh. Well, it can't be helped. Against Keethrax, be resistant to fire, go up to him and start bashing him. If you engage him in a hallway, you can ignore the Darkness spells as you will be able to hit him just as hard in the dark. If he is in a room and stays in there, you should have an amulet of light or a torch ready. Keethrax can hit somewhat hard, so finish him off as quickly as you can. Mighty blows in berserk mode with a decent weapon should take him down in two hits. I'd consider fighting him with a Barbarian of level 8 and upwards. Below can work too, but you have to be pretty powerful, orc or troll for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Hotzenplotz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't melee him. Don't let him even come near you. I know, you're a Barbarian, honorable battle and all that, but do you have any desire to be poisoned to death? Good. If you trust your missile weapon skills enough, you may shoot him in berserk mode and hope that you manage to kill him before he reaches you. This works especially well with a Barbarian of at least level 12 because of the class power. Shoot, run away, shoot, repeat until Hotzenplotz is dead. Grunge and Munge can be meleed without risking poisoning damage, though they can occasionally hit hard. If you don't have missile skills good enough to do the trick, you can use wands. Wands of lightning or magic missiles work especially well if you can get them to bounce and hit Hotzenplotz twice with one shot. Simply seek a bit of distance, stay in coward mode and shoot until Hotzenplotz is dead, at least until a berserk finishing blow can hope to catch him. Wands of poison are an especially clever way to kill Hotzenplotz. Simply run away from him in coward mode until he croaks. Using wands is a lot less risky than using missiles. Being able to run away in general is good against Hotzenplotz, so try and keep your speed as high as possible. Every Barbarian has Athletics, so even below level 12 you are faster than him while unburdened und non-satiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Rehetep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against Rehetep, you can go for brute force; but undead slaying ammo or the wand of fireballs from Thrundarr are the best way. His mummies are not very dangerous, but have some curaria mancox handy in case you are sickened. His servants can be more problematic. Be prepared for as large a variety of out-of-depth monsters as possible, have means of invisibility so you aren't attacked by all monsters at once and can hope to make a run for it if push comes to shove. Means of Healing - blessed spenseweed for instance - are highly recommended. Not only for Rehetep, but in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Nonnak&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be at least resistant, if not immune, to cold before you engage Nonnak. If you're equipped with the ancient mummy wrapping from Rehetep, you should take every opportunity you get to stay away from Nonnak and fire arrows or quarrels at him, he will try in vain to damage you with frost bolts. In melee, he can occasionally get some mean critical hits in. Against a reasonably powerful Barbarian, however, he won't stand a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Griff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a formidable opponent in melee. If you can teleport behind him and pour holy water on his grave, do it, you'll get the experience anyway. Otherwise, be prepared for a drawn out fight, as he has high defenses and hitpoints. It doesn't hurt to have blessed spenseweed handy. Use undead slaying ammo if you want to spare yourself the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Snake from Beyond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A first taste of the horror that is an orb guardian. Against the Snake from Beyond, you'll come to love your level 12 class power. After fighting against all the servants around the temple, try to make it so that you fight against the Snake alone, with no meddling elementals and demons. This can be achieved by becoming invisible, crossing the water and leaving through the hallway you dug through the temple while the snake is on your tails. High speed is your friend. You can either use it to keep or get a distance between you and the Snake, shooting off your missiles - though it is unlikely that missiles will be very effective unless you have high dexterity or are a hurthling (best if you're a hurthling with high dexterity, of course!). You can also shoot off some wands, though the Snake will probably shrug off most of the bolts. If all this doesn't seem to be able to help much, you'll have to bite the bullet and go into melee. Don't be too low on DV if possible, as the Snake hits hard and poisons and corrupts you. On the other hand, the Snake has a fair share of PV, so what to do? The best thing may be to switch to berserk anyway and either deal tremendous blows or repeat after each hit in such a way that the Snake cannot attack you, preferably with a poisoned weapon since that will work on the snake a bit while you run away a bit. A wand of paralyzation, should you have one, is a tremendous asset. Use it - it can be recharged for the later fights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Skeletal King&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undead slaying ammo. Confusion resistance so he doesn't get you eaten by piranhas before you have a chance to leave the bridge you built. High fire resistance or immunity so the magical barrages he fires don't hurt you. He can be beaten in melee, but he is hard to kill that way and hits pretty hard himself. Slaying ammo simply spares you a lot of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Ancient Chaos Wyrm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The doom of many promising PCs. Barbarians benefit from their high hitpoint counts against him. If only they could cast Frost or Acid Bolt! The biggest danger while fighting the wyrm is his shock attack. It is best to avoid being shock attacked by him as much as possible. There are two ways to do that: Have monsters between you and him so he can't hit you (but that won't help a lot in the long run, since you want to kill him and don't have spells to do it well from afar), or take away his ability to shock attack you. This can be done by blinding him, by confusing him, by paralyzing him or by killing him. The last of these possibilies is the most appealing one, I'm sure, but sadly, it takes some good hits with your best way of dealing damage to achieve it. If you have dragon slaying ammo, it is probably superior to your melee weapon; having Vanquisher or Wyrmlance at this point is best, so try to get crowned beforehand for Vanquisher. Use tremendous berserk blows, as a melee attack of the wyrm isn't as dangerous as the shock attack. To survive while killing the wyrm with your weapon, blindness, confusion and paralyzation are your friends. The first two can be induced by throwing the respective potions at the wyrm, the latter is achieved by using a wand of paralyzation. Also very helpful are wands of poison or potions of poison to dip your weapon in, and wands of cold or acid to deal the finishing blow if the wyrm decides to make a run for it. Also, be resistant to confusion, as you can hardly afford to stagger around aimlessly while the Wyrm shocks you. The key to fighting the Ancient Chaos Wyrm is cleverness. The direct brute force approach probably won't work, but with a bit of magical or alchemical help, you will be able to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Cat Lord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have killed cats? Well, it's hard to avoid that at any time with a Barbarian (as a spellcaster, you have almost no excuse). Fighting against the cat lord is a major pain in the ass. The first step you should take is a tactical retreat: Lure him to either a level above or a level below so you can teleport away in a pinch. Afterwards, consider the following: The cat lord casts invisibility; seeing invisible is essential, equip the ancient mummy wrapping or a ring of see invisible if you don't have the intrinsic yourself. The cat lord also is very fast and hits very hard, depending on how many cats you killed, he can be motherfucking fast and beat the living shit out of you. Luckily, that is the full extent of his abilities (though it's bad enough). Humanoid slaying ammo is effective, and paralyzation from a wand is, again, very useful against him. When he is paralyzed (it will take several tries), try your best to hit as hard as ever possible (berserk, if the cat lord's PV is high and your damage not that high, tremendous - remember that you can theoretically let the game stay where it is and do the math!) - his high DV and hitpoints give him a chance to get moving again and devastate you. Remember: He who fights the Cat Lord without blessed potions of extra or ultra healing in his backpack is naught but an addle-brained fool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Yulgash, the Master Summoner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you reach Yulgash, he should be easily killed in melee (especially with a humanoid slaying weapon), or with humanoid slaying ammo. The trouble is reaching him. The Temple itself is full of static electricity that can damage a PC and his equipment. Don't bring anything too valuable into the Temple; scrolls of chaos resistance or the like should be left on another level. As a Barbarian, you should be powerful enough to clear the right outside of the Temple. To-hit is important, as air creatures tend to have no PV but high DV, so berserk mode with non-tremendous blows might be a good idea. On the other hand, the vapor rats, grues and demons have high to-hit themselves and will corrupt you more, so against these, you should use one of the defensive modes (not coward, though). You can clear the whole outside of the temple, but I advise against it - there's no reason to spend too much of your time having equipment destroyed. Once you have cleared the right part of the temple grounds, become invisible (preferably, as it protects you from being attacked by elementals and grues you haven't attacked yourself) and open the Temple itself by searching for a secret door in the middle of the right wall. Lure the elementals out someway, defeat some of them until you can get into melee range to Yulgash or have a clear shot with humanoid slaying ammo. Yulgash will follow you out into the hallway if you wait long enough, but who knows what he will summon until he's there? Once Yulgash is defeated, grab the orb and leave, unless you want to lose some more equipment to the charged air and the elementals' lightning bolts. If you went into the Temple without notable equipment anyway, that's of course an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Ancient Stone Beast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question: Do you have some way of penetration? Any weapon with the magical suffix "of penetration" or phase dagger is your best bet against this opponent. It's almost guaranteed to do more damage than any other weapon as it will bypass the 60 PV of the Ancient Stone Beast. No penetration? I think the Stone Beast is a construct, so unlife slaying (like Vanquisher and Purifier possess) should work well, just remember to use tremendous blows since you'll have to overcome the PV. In this case, they will always be worth it. The attacks of the Ancient Stone Beast tend to be relatively harmless, and he doesn't drain stats or anything else remotely remarkable. Just damage, and not too much of it. Again, the more annoying part of fighting against it is fighting against its servants, the elementals and grues. Be careful while digging a hallway towards the temple, as they pass through stone and are capable of surrounding you by blocking your only escape route. Being surrounded by potentially hard-hitting elementals and grues might be an exciting opportunity to prove your battle prowess, but survival is important, too, right? Well then. Against the elementals and grues, the same tactics apply that I have already explained for the Ancient Stone Beast, only that they have 40 instead of 60 PV and elementals don't have corrupting attacks, making them infinitely more pleasant to fight than the grues. If you don't want to fight them all at once, you have to lure some of them to another level since you can't use hallways as choke points like you've done with every tension room until this point. That way, you can at least restrict the number of elementals and grues you have to fight at once, mostly making it a one-on-two fight. With the right weapon and tactic, it will be tedious, but doable work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God, I hate that guy. Okay, before you even step one foot into the Temple, ask yourself: Are you resistant to death rays? If not, see that you are. Now, are you resistant to confusion? No? Well, don't blame me if you find yourself spending your precious time stumbling about in the corridor while you're being shot at with shock attack after shock attack. Do you have a torch or an amulet of light? Good. Do you have humanoid slaying ammo? No? Be prepared for berserk tremendous blow, having to drink a couple of potions of extra and ultra healing, and stat drains. Awful lots of stat drains. A fucking awful lot of godforsaken stat drains from hell. Even humanoid slaying ammo won't prevent having to resort to melee fighting reliably. This battle, to make it short, is a pain in the ass in any way. The only ones that ever seem to have an easy time are archers with their awesome missile abilities and humanoid slaying ammo. Or cheap spellcasters who use high-Willpower Acid Ball while having a GOD DAMN DOOR prevent Nuurag-Vaarn from attacking them. Sigh. A Barbarian's life is never easy. Well then, if you fulfill the requirements mentioned, you have a good chance. But first, you'll stand before the doorway and fight against hordes after hordes of summoned chaos creatures. If ever possible, try to berserk the annihilators away with tremendous blows - they're worth taking out quickly to prevent your equipment from being destroyed. Sometimes, you can walk into the choke point to reach one of the chaos wizards and take him out. You'll be hit by three monsters instead of one, but chaos wizards must be taken out if you want to get out of that darn place in a reasonable timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;Sooner or later, Nuurag-Vaarn won't be able to resist the temptation anymore and come for you. Once it's between you and him, get some distance (easier said than done, because confusion resistance doesn't seem to work in any way remotely reliable) and shoot off your humanoid slaying ammo. If that didn't do the trick, prepare yourself for some nasty stat drains and melee him, tremendous berserk all the way to take him out as quickly as possible. Since he won't always use his melee attack, the DV loss isn't that bad compared to the faster taking him out. Switch to coward if you need to drink a blessed extra or ultra healing potion (You do have some with you, right?). Don't overestimate yourself - drink that potion if your HP drop below a value you deem unsafe, even if you still have more than 150 HP left. You'll see for yourself how hard his spells will hit. But don't forget to attack, and do it with a vengeance. With any luck and a decent weapon, he should be killed before he can drain too many stats. Even if your stats got drained a fair bit, laugh with glee as you stand above his mangled remains - this was one of the hardest fights you'll ever have to endure.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/6542054434381428720/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=6542054434381428720' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/6542054434381428720'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/6542054434381428720'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2007/11/guide-to-being-barbarian.html' title='Guide to Being a Barbarian'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3710148354194913408.post-8514998351581459654</id><published>2007-09-16T22:49:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2007-09-29T03:07:32.250+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='archer'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='guide'/><title type='text'>Guide to being an Archer</title><content type='html'>NOTE: The Archer Guide has been revised. You'll notice a couple of sections have been added, others expanded. Especially the Weapon choice section has been renamed Weapons and should actually be called Equipment now. Will do it right the next time (Barbarian guide is already in progress!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us begin with one of the easier classes to play, which is, coincidentally, the first in the alphabetical list of all classes: the Archer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual Information - The most basic stuff, reprinted in place of an introduction.&lt;br /&gt;II. Starting up the archer - All there is to consider when deciding which kind of archer to play.&lt;br /&gt;III. Playing style - What you should try to do with your archer over the course of the game.&lt;br /&gt;IV. Weapons - What kind of weapons you should and shouldn't use, and why. Also, a couple of hints regarding ammunition gatherage.&lt;br /&gt;V. Archer vs. Boss - Hints on how to beat your most dangerous opponents throughout the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Manual information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archers are deadly shots.  Although the name of their class seems to imply this, not all of them prefer to use bows.  The race of an archer has great influence on their preferred missile weapon. Archers are expert fighters in missile combat, rarely missing their targets and trained to hit the vital spots of their opponents. In close combat, archers are less formidable, although they are still dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Archery, Climbing, Concentration, Dodge, Fletchery, Listening, and Stealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At higher levels archers are the most deadly marksmen in all Ancardia.  At level 6 a missile attack takes up but 800 energy points. At level 12 the range for their missile attacks is doubled.  At level 18 they are a lot more productive when applying fletchery.  At level 25 missile attacks cost but 600 energy points.  At level 32 they become able to completely dodge enemy missiles.  At level 40 missiles attacks have a 20% chance to penetrate armor and at level 50 they are able to hit several targets with one missile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II. Starting up the archer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Starsigns&lt;br /&gt;Concerning starsigns, the guidebook gives a couple of good hints. Archers benefit greatly from the Raven starsign since they can hit and run a lot easier with it; it also has the nice effect that you become resistant to doppleganger confusion ("harder to trick by deceptions"). Candle is always nice for classes without Healing (it allows for regenerating at a decent speed); you can afford going Herbalism much easier with the Candle starsign. The other starsigns don't offer much to the archer. Sword and Dragon are somewhat useful for faster weapon skill gainage (though Sword only increases melee weapons skills, so Dragon is probably more useful). Unicorn, as always, is nice for ultimate aspirers. Falcon adds a not really useful skill (works nice for buffing up the skill page of high elven archers, though). Book is useful for elven or gnomish archers because it improves upon their latent spellcasting abilities later on. The other casting starsigns aren't that spectacular, though all of them do offer some minor advantage.&lt;br /&gt;Worthy of attention is the "a falling star killed the village elder" part of your history. It decreases the number of marks you need to advance in your missile weapon skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. General starting equipment&lt;br /&gt;All archers start out with a missile weapon and ammo OR a stack of throwing weapons. All (except trolls) wear [0,0] equipment that can occasionally add to starting PV, all have a very basic type of melee weapon on them, all start with a fletchery set and an iron ration, replaced by a spider bread for dark elves, and some with a torch and fire-making equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Race-specific starting equipment and race evaluation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Human:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Swimming, Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Leather armor, Longbow, about 50 arrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good missile weapon with lots of starting ammo&lt;br /&gt;Cons: PV of 2 on starting equipment leaves archer somewhat frail, only mediocre dexterity, rather short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Okay choice, but definitely outclassed by other races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Troll:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Athletics, Bridge Building, Food Preservation, Gemology, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Thick furs, heavy club, 5-10 throwing clubs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quite sturdy thanks to high regeneration rate, toughness and strength, Athletics skill is pretty powerful, Gemology and Mining at least useful&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Horrible archer weapons at start, only mediocre dexterity, troll experience and troll metabolism, very short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Pretty bad choice, suffers from all the disadvantages of trolls while not making much use of their advantages, does not start out with ranged weapons worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) High Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Literacy.&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Elven chain mail, Longbow, about 50 arrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Excellent starting equipment (elven chain mail more than makes up for low toughness), very high dexterity, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Almost no skillset additions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: IMHO the best choice; with 20/5 DV/PV right off the bat and plenty of ammo you're all set up for a relatively easy early game; excellent missile damage thanks to high dexterity and longbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Gray Elf:&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, see High Elf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Very good, not as good as high elves due to slightly lower regeneration rate, strength, toughness and dexterity. They do have an even longer lifespan - but high elves are already so good it's hardly relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Dark Elf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Find Weakness.&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Elven chain mail, Hand Crossbow, up to 20 tiny quarrels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Elven chain mail, very high dexterity, Find Weakness skill, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not a lot ammo to work with at the beginning, bad starting missile weapon, slowest regeneration rate of all races&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Very good, but have to find a bow or crossbow with respective ammo quick; if they manage that, they're better than high elves due to Find Weakness skill. Still, early game is somwhat harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Dwarf:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Detect Traps, Metallurgy, Mining, Smithing&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Chain mail, Heavy boots, Heavy crossbow, 40-50 quarrels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Detect Traps, very decent starting equipment, sturdy due to high toughness and PV, other skills are useful too, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Rather low dexterity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Decent; can survive the early game comfortably with PV of 6 or better, high toughness and lots of ammo; are somewhat held back by low dexterity, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Gnome:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Gemology, Mining, Pick pockets, Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Leather armor, Gnomish boots, Light crossbow, about 30 quarrels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A couple of pretty useful skills, easier training in crossbows, long lifespan&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Low PV on starting equipment, overall only average equipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Okay choice; the crossbow bonus is nice, but isn't enough to completely offset the disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Hurthling:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Cooking, Food Preservation, Gardening&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: cursed ring, sling, about 20 rocks, cooking set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very high dexterity, level 4 thrown rocks skill, easier training in slings and thrown rocks&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Zero PV on starting equipment, skills are convenient, but useless in battle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Pretty good, not as spectular as the guidebook would have you believe, though; the low PV makes early game a bit difficult if you don't manage to kill anything with your wicked rocks; slings and thrown rocks aren't the best weapons for an archer overall, making the high bonus to weapon skill marks less valuable as it may seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Orc:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Backstabbing, Find Weakness, Metallurgy, Mining&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: Studded leather armor, Light crossbow, about 15 quarrels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice skillset addition, especially Find Weakness, quite sturdy thanks to decent toughness and strength&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not much starting ammo, low dexterity, short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: A bit better than okay choice; Find Weakness is very nice to have, yet low starting ammo and low dexterity are turnoffs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Drakeling:&lt;br /&gt;Skills added: Food Preservation, Music, Swimming&lt;br /&gt;Notable starting equipment: About twenty drakish scurgari&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Unique racial ability, relatively high regeneration rate&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No armor, low dexterity, scurgari are rather rare to find, rather short lifespan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Probably the worst class for an archer; Alertness, a major selling point of drakelings, is already included in the archer skillset; except for a pretty uselessly low Music skill, humans get the same skillset additions plus halfway decent starting equipment; like dark elves and trolls, drakelings have to look for other ranged weapons right off the bat while not being able to withstand prolonged melee (even with their natural regeneration rate, which is higher than that of other non-troll races); the breathing attack is pretty pointless since as an archer you should have better distance attacks available and in the beginning, when you need it most, you can't use it that heavily due to food problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;All in all, high elves and dark elves are contenders for the best archer race, though I prefer high elves. Gray elves are High elves light. After these Hurthlings and dwarves are the next best races, followed by orcs, then humans and gnomes, after that trolls and on the last place drakelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Making it a little more complicated.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the above was based on the assumption that you want the character with the highest chances of winning overall. I firmly believe elven archers do just that. They give you very good equipment and their skills are supported by very high dexterity, making them archery powerhouses right from the start, killing machines capable of taking down even the out-of-depth monsters the RNG has so much fun placing you between even at very early levels. And yet, it cannot be denied that they also have the smallest skillsets of all the archers. A high elven archer and a human archer have a couple of differences at the beginning - elven chain mail versus leather armor, dexterity of 25 versus 15, 50% higher Dodge skill value... And no skill versus Food Preservation and Swimming skills. And I say "no skill" because the Literacy skill high elves get both humans and high elves would get anyway due to their high Learning scores. Now, give the human better armor, a couple dozens of (uncursed) mosses of mareilon, and a bit of time to increase the Dodge skill. Then, give the high elf the Swimming skill, because it costs nothing more than a couple potions of carrot juice to get if you know how. And what do you get? A human with the Food Preservation skill and a high elf without it. Now, you may not deem the Food Preservation skill very valuable. Remember, however, that it increases your chances to get corpses from monsters. Corpses, besides from being free food, can occasionally increase stats. And the occasions become much more numerous if you have the Food Preservation skill. Personally, I don't consider it too much of a loss... But look at, say, orcs. Compare them to a high elven archer. Besides being smelly and clumsy, they have Find Weakness, Backstabbing, Mining and Metallurgy. Now, Metallurgy is useless, and Backstabbing can be obtained within the game. That still means orcs get Find Weakness and Mining and high elves don't. The orc even has the advantage of getting Mining over the dark elf. In other words: If versatility, the number and quality of skills, would decide who is the best archer, high elves would actually make last instead of tied first place. Second last place is for hurthlings because, let's be frank, their skills suck except for Food Preservation. Then humans, then drakelings, then dwarves (for Detect Traps alone), dark elves (because Find Weakness is just that awesome), gnomes (because their skills are really useful at times), trolls (Because Athletics is teh awesome and Food Preservation and Gemology are pretty nice), and orcs taking the king spot just because they get Find Weakness PLUS Mining.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, you can scratch that whole thing I just did, because the skillset (and thus the race) you should choose depends on your own playing style and personal preferance. If you like the Food Preservation skill, Humans, hurthlings, trolls and drakelings are the thing for you. If you like Find Weakness (and I see no reason why you couldn't), you'll want to play an orc or dark elf. If you love Detect Traps, a dwarf is the obvious choice. And the gnome is nice for Ventriloquism... The list goes on and on. Check the section for skills later on for a closer evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;III. Playing style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Archers in general&lt;br /&gt;Archers, as has been aptly described in the manual, are best when using their ranged weapons. They can attack faster and deal more damage that way than any other class can. Apart from that, they're not the worst melee fighters, and they can make effective use of minor spellcasting because of their Concentration skill, though they have to build up on their Literacy first. You can use a melee weapon to fight most of the opponents you meet, but once you face a really dangerous opponent, it's your ranged weapon you have to fall back on. It's important not to neglect your ranged weapon skills - even though you can beat most opponents with melee weapons to save ammo, with a lower skill you deal less damage when you really need every point you can get.&lt;br /&gt;Generally, when exploring more dangerous dungeons, it is important to gauge your position carefully, to know which opponents you should keep a distance from. Keeping a distance, anyway, is the most imporant skill you should learn when playing archers. Every meter between you and your dangerous opponent is a resource to be valued. Speed is important. Every skill, talent or class power that decreases energy point consumption for actions like attacking and moving is important. If your opponent ever reaches you and you can't get away, though, keep on using your ranged weapon - because, in the end, it will still deal the most damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Dopplegangers&lt;br /&gt;Archers in general have a rather easy time playing (If there is such a thing as an easy time in ADOM). Dopplegangers are a nuisance, though. Normal ones fall in melee (careful with hurthlings, they have no armor at the beginning and low strength; drakelings can at least use the breathing attack), by the time doppleganger lords appear they fall in melee as well or to a wand, but doppleganger kings are pretty damn dangerous (fortunately, by the time you meet them they should be easily avoided or dispatched with spells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Skills to obtain&lt;br /&gt;A disadvantage of playing archers is the lack of either the Healing or Herbalism skill. Healing is, in my opinion, the better choice, so you should take the Village Dungeon quest by talking to Rynt before Guth'Alak. If you feel like heavily exploiting Herbalism, though, you could also pick the Keethrax quest by talking to Guth'Alak first and gather lots of spenseweed to replace Healing. Just know that once you get the Keethrax quest, you can't get Healing except through lucking out with a potion or scroll of education. Note that while Keethrax has the black torc, a pretty useless artifact, Yrrigs has a hatchet - number one on your tool wishlist if you're an archer. Also, herbs aren't actually plenty - if you're unlucky, you won't find any until you reach the Big Room inside the Caverns of Chaos (You'll know it when you see it)!&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of skills than can be learnt by talking to right people in the Drakalor chain. The old barbarian teaches you the Courage skill under several conditions: First, to get the quest, you have to slay 500 monsters of any kind. The quest demands that you kill twenty (He doesn't say twenty, but you came to this guide to get accurate information, right?) more of the monster you first slew. It's good to know what monster that was. I have a knack for forgetting that; and I'm pretty sure I should get rid of that if I ever want to complete an ultimate ending. I usually get the quest when I head east towards the CoC and stop by his clearing, and I usually have slain the monsters he demanded when I return to tackle the graveyard. Courage increases your to-hit and DV when attacked by more than one opponent. To be exact, it lowers the penalties that usually take effect if you are surrounded. Usually you shouldn't let that happen at all, but sometimes it's near impossible to avoid - and in these cases, Courage is VERY nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;Another important source of skills is Bart, the grizzled gladiator who hangs around in the Dwarftown inn. If you become champion of the arena and obtain the golden gladius as a reward and talk to Bart, he will reminisce about his sad past and afterwards ask if he can get the gladius in exchange for training. Bart's training consists of some minor weapon skill training in all the melee weapon skills - pretty pointless for an archer - and, most importantly, of teaching the skills Backstabbing, Tactics and Two weapon combat. Except for orcish archers, all three of these skills are new. Especially the Tactics skill is well worth giving up the gladius, a pretty decent sword for the early game. The other two only come into play in rare occasions - though the latter is pretty much a prerequisite to fighting with two weapons in any way effective. Tactics increases the positive effects and lowers the negative effect of the different stances on the tactics scale. With Tactics, your berserking becomes a lot more powerful, your cowardice a lot more cowardly, and everything else also gets better. Tactics is useless if you stay in Normal mode, however - but skilled players don't stay in normal mode when they battle; usually, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;There are, of course, more skills available, some from pretty surprising sources. First, Yergius teaches all the thieves skills to you. Pick Pockets is trivial to get, but the others can only be obtained by becoming a member of the thieves guild. To become a member, you have to use the Pick Pockets skill about twenty-five times successfully. I think being nonlawful is also a prerequisite. Once you're in, you can have Yergius teach you all the other Thieves skills: Detect traps, Disarm traps and Pick locks. (And Stealth - but you have that already.) Disarm traps is of limited use, because you can avoid traps you have detected pretty easily with decent Dexterity and Perception, and Pick locks is even worse, since doors that late in the game are usually opened with keys, and even with Pick locks, you still need thieves tools to open doors. I needn't mention that they drop next to never randomly, and you have to be level 13 to enter the pyramid to get the only guaranteed in the game. At that point, you should have wands of knocking anyway or simply kick down the doors you don't have keys for. The Detect traps skill, however, is very useful, and covered in a later section. Dwarves already have it and can easily afford not becoming a member of the thieves guild.&lt;br /&gt;There's not much left. Blup, the baby water dragon, loves carrot juice. If you give enough of it to him (blessed works better), he will teach you how to swim. For those that can't already swim (all but humans and drakelings) this is a godsend. You can also get the Law skill from Tywat Pare if you kill both Kranach and Hotzenplotz for him, but that skill is pretty useless. Usually common sense tells you what is a chaotic act and what is not, and the Law skill only kicks in after you've already done what you did.&lt;br /&gt;More obscurely, if you find dark sage corpses lying around while illiterate, bless one to guarantee that it works and gulp it down. Bang, Literacy skill without potion of Literacy. Veeery nice, especially when you got a near-impossible first Thrundarr quest.&lt;br /&gt;And finally, having been born unter the sign of Falcon grants you the Survival skill - of low importance, but can save your life when you run out of food in the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Archer battle tactics&lt;br /&gt;A technique an archer should remember and use often is berserking archery. It's simple, really - as long as your opponents are still away, they can't hit you. So you ignore the DV loss of berserk tactics and get a good deal of extra to-hit and damage that should help dispatching enemies before they can touch you. Not the tactic to use when you encounter a titan or another monster with a powerful missile attack, though. Know thine Enemy! (And know the use of the Tactics settings! It's a bit much for most newbies, but it really helps to remember that you can switch to coward when you need to drink a potion in the middle of a mob attacking you...)&lt;br /&gt;Another very useful technique is hit and run. The archer class powers together with certain talents and weapon skills decrease the time you need for a missile attack tremendously. This means that you can attack an opponent next to you and still move; with the help of Long Stride, the Speed talents or even the low HP coward movement bonus, you can then fall back until there is a square between you yet again. Shoot, repeat until opponent is dead. If you do it right, you can minimize the times you are hit even to zero (provided you have the space and aren't stopped by other monsters!). In this case, combine the two tactics to form this basic principle of Archery in ADOM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they can't hit you, go berserk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. About class powers&lt;br /&gt;The king and queen of the archer class powers come at level 6 and 25: The reduction of the energy points needed for a missile attack, which basically shortens the timespan your archer has to wait until he can do something again after using a missile attack. Add Lightning Shot. Add weapon skill energy point boni. You will end up with an energy cost so low you can basically shoot several times before an opposing monster can even land a hit on you; especially if your speed is high. This is an enormous advantage and the reason why archers are so much better at using missile weapons than any other class.&lt;br /&gt;If the level 6 and 25 archer class powers are the king and queen, the level 18 power would be the crown prince. Archers are not only masters at missile attacks, they are the most proficient users of the Fletchery skill. Their class power enables them to create near infinite stocks of arrows and quarrels. Ammo created by the Fletchery skill, like randomly dropped ammo, has the chance of being assigned magical prefixes and suffixes. Since you get stacks of over 100 arrows or quarrels with a single use of a fletchery set with the help of the class power, there is a chance of getting 100, say, penetrating arrows of slaying any time you use the talent. Even without that much luck, you still get enough ammo to allow you to use arrows or quarrels exclusively, which works wonders in training your missile weapon skills, eventually reaching Grand Mastery! You should collect any fletchery set you can find and keep all of them until you hit level 18. Then, start chopping logs and go fletching! Do not use wooden sticks. They are loser fletching material and do not deserve your attention. I will mention again that a hatchet is very high on your list of desirable tools to find, since your only source of logs without it is the Animated Forest. They are rare, but Yrrigs always has one and will give it to you either willingly or unwillingly. Get it!&lt;br /&gt;I kind of glossed over the level 12 class power that doubles your missile attack ranges completely, sorry if you're confused. Simply put, that one simply isn't necessary. Your ranges are fine without the class power thanks to the Archery skill and missile weapon skills; they will end up being greater than the map is wide! (Though you'll be grateful for this class power if you want to throw huge rocks or stuff like that...)&lt;br /&gt;The level 32 class power... I will point out that there aren't really that many enemies of note for a level 32 character that actually shoot missiles. Basically, I can only think of earth elementals, titans and greater titans. Against these? Well, the class power can save your ass. Considering you should have plenty of giant slaying ammo at this point, though, it's not as spectacular. After level 25, all archers pretty much become death incarnate anyway (if played right).&lt;br /&gt;The level 40 class power is rather useful against late game high-PV monsters (Ancient Stone Beast! Grrr...), which are otherwise a nuisance or even dangerous (eternium golems, anyone?). You should have penetrating ammo handy at level 40, but in case you haven't, you'll love this class power. Even if only one out of five shots ignores PV, this still means a considerable kick in the butt that could ease your trouble winning against eternium golems. And against any other opponent, a 20% chance to ignore their physical armor translates to a 20% chance to cause a bit to quite a lot more damage, which is nothing to scoff at.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other level 50 class powers, the archer one is rather weak - on the other hand, your first three class powers are teh awesome already. Being able to shoot more than one monster at once is convenient for dealing with crowds, but nothing more. Now, if you have an artifact missile - True Aim or Thunderstroke - then you could smite a lot of monsters with one of these, I'll admit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Talent choice&lt;br /&gt;Regarding talents, all the archery talents (except the rather useless Far Shot and the maybe not quite as, but still useless Strong Thrower) are pretty much musts. This includes the following: Alert (starting talent), Good Shot, Keen Shot, Eagle-Eyed, Quick, Quick Shot, Lightning Shot, three affinites (if you take my advice, these are Bows, Crossbows, and whatever strikes your fancy), Missile Weapon Master (For which I have chosen Alert, Keen Shot and the three affinities beforehand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listed eleven talents. On your way to Level 50, if you get one starting talent, you get 17 talents total, so you're left with six. I would add the other two Speed talents Very Quick and Greased Lightning. Since you've already chosen Alert as a starting talent, I'd add Miser and Treasure Hunter, because the latter is awesome (Some say that you can just kill more monsters to get the treasure, but why should I do that when I can actually advance in the game instead?). Two talents left? It's up to you. Porter and Master Packager are useful for carrying around your missile arsenal, Long Stride can help in a ton of situations especially early in the game. Strong Thrower is probably not bad if you plan on using throwing weapons extensively (though why you would do that is beyond me). Also tempting are the DV-increasing talents (Careful, Shield Fighter and so on). With extra starting talents, you can even get Beast of Burden. To get the bookcasting talents, however, you have to sacrifice some of the talents above (Missile Weapon Master and the affinities, preferably). Depends on your opinion about bookcasting; my archers usually use spells rarely if ever, and when you're not in the middle of a battle you don't care all that much whether you spend 3000 energy points on a bookcasted Invisibility or 1000. And for the middles of battles, there's still wands and scrolls. Your main damage dealing comes from arrows and quarrels, not spells. Narcolepcy (thanks again) has pointed me towards Natural Berserker, a talent requiring Aggressive as a prerequisite, which increases to-hit and damage by two each while fighting in berserk mode. However, when you're already in berserk mode, those two extra points aren't as spectacular as they would seem: You've already got enormous to-hit and damage when you berserk. Personally, I think you'd be better off if you spent the two talents required for Natural Berserker elsewhere. Nonetheless, it's worth mentioning. For details regarding talents I didn't cover, you're better off checking them out in the guidebook. Now a last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get three starting talents, you can choose Charming, Boon to the Family, and finally Heir. The archer heir gift is a bundle of 40 winged quarrels of hunting. These are normal quarrels except that they fly twice as far and increase the chance that the monster hit drops a course. If you ask me, this is most definitely not worth giving up Missile Weapon Master and Treasure Hunter, for which you'd need a starting talent spent on Alert as prerequisite. I would only consider getting Heir if you somehow got four starting talents (And even then, I'd rather enjoy the luxury of being able to take Long Stride AND all the carrying capacity talents, or DV talents, or Long-lived...). Theoretically, four starting talents are possible with a Candle-born gnomish archer with high mana, or a Candle-born elf with decent mana/Candle-born hurthling with low mana that also gets lucky (There is a one out of seven chance to obtain an extra talent for any character; you get it if, after character creation, your stats are dividable by seven.). The maximum is five (Candle- or Falcon-born gnomish archer with high mana who also gets lucky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Mad Archer skillz&lt;br /&gt;As an archer, you don't have that many skills, but the ones you have aren't bad. Since you don't have many skills, you won't have much trouble deciding which to increase and which not. Sometimes you'll even find yourself with more skill advances than you can even use wisely (Especially with elves due to their small skillset and high Learning). Enjoy that Luxury - or better, obtain more skills to increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Alertness&lt;br /&gt;Alertness is a skill that you may not actively notice often, but everytime your character manages to avoid a trap he or she didn't even see... your alertness is what probably spared you a lot of trouble. Later on in the game traps become more of a nuisance than a threat (though it still sucks if an acid trap destroys valuable equipment), but the other feature of alertness will become more important - the chance to evade spells and certain creature attacks like water breathing or the like. This can really save your ass against powerful opponents like dragons, wyrms, Nuurag-Vaarn... The list goes on and on. So, be thankful for the alertness skill, and be nice to it. Sadly, it is rather hard to increase, so you should turn your attention to other skills once it has approached around the fifties, only occasionally increasing it as the levels drop by. (On very high levels, you even get extra DV points out of this skill, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Archery&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to be said about this skill. It increases range, damage and to-hit of ranged attacks (awesome). Aside from that, possessing it gives you a chance to hit opponents even in the "red" range (not that awesome, because you usually don't have problems with missile range as an archer). This is a top-priority skill, and on top of that, easy to increase. You will (and should) have this at 100 very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Climbing&lt;br /&gt;This skill isn't really that useful. Climbing out of pits isn't a main part of your adventuring career, to say the least. Climbing around mountains with a higher skill in this may be easier, but then again there is little need to play around in the mountains. Climbing must, however, be maxed if you plan on going down the Rift. As an archer, the Rift - and the Library contained therein - is hardly a necessary visit. If you feel reckless, however, don't let me stop you, and spend a few skill advances and especially training on this skill so you don't have to wait forever for it to reach 100. But at least have Stealth at 100 by that time as well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Concentration&lt;br /&gt;Next up is Concentration. While not as useful at archery in this regard, it does improve on your to-hit and maybe even damage, apart from the better-known - and more noticable - effect of increasing your power point regeneration rate. Later on, when you start casting spells (you will if you are an elf or gnome, you probably won't as much if you're a troll), having this skill is a great help. Early on you have neither spellbooks nor decent Literacy (*if* you even have it - as an orc or troll, you probably won't); so Concentration is of low priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Dodge&lt;br /&gt;Now, Dodge. It adds to your DV, the higher the skill the more DV you get out of it. DV, in case you spent your earlier ADOM career living under a rock, increases your chances not to be hit by enemy attacks. Do you want to be hit by enemy attacks? Surely not. So do you want high DV? Of course you do. What do you do to get yourself high DV? Why, yes, increase the Dodge skill. The help from the Dodge skill is most valuable early on, so don't hesitate to make use of your skill increases on it on every one of your early levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) First Aid&lt;br /&gt;Hm, First Aid. It's not an archer skill per se, but now that you have it you want to know what to do with it, right? First Aid can be 'a'pplied to heal part of recently sustained wounds. Very recently. We're talking about four rounds, tops. Now, whatever caused that wound is very likely to still be around by that time, and rather than applying this skill (especially with its chance of failure) you should be attacking that opponent! If the battle is over, though, it won't hurt to use this skill in case you can still save some of your precious hitpoints. The problem with this skill is that it is much more useful in higher skill levels, but at the same time the First Aid skill in general is only a great helper in the early game - in the later game, you can use spenseweed, drink potions, or wait for a few rounds until your wounds are healed by your godly regeneration rate granted upon you by the Healing skill. First Aid also helps against poisoning and sickness (again, this is most useful early on). Everytime you're damaged by those conditions - either by "poison coursing through your veins" or being "wracked by feverish fits", you can use First Aid, regaining some or all hit points, sometimes even healing the poisoning or sickness. It's a slim chance, but it can save your butt. My advice is either to put your points into this skill as early as possible or leave it as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Fletchery&lt;br /&gt;I already explained a bit about it. Now, your class power kicks in at level 18. By that time you want it at 100, no discussion about it. How you increase it before, however, is up to you. If you think you won't be using Fletchery before level 18, wait for a bit and increase other skills more instead. If you do want to use Fletchery earlier, you should arrange for it to be at 100 by then. Fletchery isn't hard to train for archers. Together with Archery, it is one of your earliest 100s. The point is, if you won't be using it for quite a time, you should divert your skill advances to maxing Dodge, Alertness or Archery or other skills you fancy more important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Haggling&lt;br /&gt;What a loser skill. You can always try haggling with shopkeepers over price. But waste precious skill advances just so you can save a couple o' coins? Hell no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Listening&lt;br /&gt;Another skill you don't even notice is there, probably because everyone has it. Do not waste skill advances on this. I won't elaborate on the uses it may have, but simply point out that this skill increases itself wonderfully without your support. It starts out at forties, sixties even if you're an elf, and as you don't need it at certain values for anything, why waste the effort?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Stealth&lt;br /&gt;Last skill on the standard archer list. Now, I'm not clear on its use. Even with a 100 stealth skill, you can't sneak around like you're invisible or something, though it might just give you the occasional opportunity of positioning yourself better before a prolonged battle, or extra chances to avoid overpowering encounters - though how tangible that effect is, I can't say. Like Listening, Stealth tends to itself. Unlike listening, increasing it to 100 is a requirement if you want to get a certain artifact, as is having 100 in climbing. Don't use your early skill advances, but if you find yourself without a decent skill to train later on, why not add it to Stealth (and Climbing) to get yourself a nice treat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Mad Non-Archer skillz.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have talked at length about standard archer skills, I will now elaborate on the other skills that can be obtained by playing certain races, to help you in your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Athletics&lt;br /&gt;You only get it as a troll, and, boy, is it a useful skill. It adds to your speed. This alone would make it as valuable as Dodge. Yet it gets better: The Athletics skill increases your chances to get stat increases! Strength, toughness and dexterity (and less spectacularly, appearance) are affected by Athletics. You want this skill at 100 for the speed bonus anyway, but you want it there ASAP to make the most of the occasional stat increases, as they will occur with levelups. This also means that trollish archers, who almost never get more than three skill advances, will have trouble deciding on their favoured skills for advancing: Athletics, Dodge, Archery, or Alertness? The situation is eased by starsigns that add skill advances, like Falcon or Candle. In any case, a wonderful skill to have, and unobtainable in-game except with a wish or a scroll or potion of education, so if you absolutely want to have this skill and can handle the negative sides of playing trolls, go ahead with my blessing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Backstabbing&lt;br /&gt;Next up is Backstabbing, a specialty of orcs. This skill adds damage if you manage to catch an opponent off-guard - either if he didn't see you (either because you're so stealthy or because it is dark) or didn't think you would backstab him (i. e. he was neutral to you). The skill doesn't always work, though; its chance to hit also is dependant on the skill level. The major catch of Backstabbing is that it is only usable with melee weapons. You're an archer. Your strategy is not to sneak up behind enemies to plunge sharp metal into their backs. Your strategy is to stay as far away as possible, aim, hit and kill. Backstabbing doesn't enter into this. So, actually, this skill is mainly useless, with few exceptions. Sometimes you need to use a phase dagger or a slaying melee weapon to deal with something dangerous, and in that case, well, you need every point of extra damage on the first hit you can get. Backstabbing is lovely for fighting water dragons in the dark, for instance. However, these uses of Backstabbing appear rather late in the game - and this late in the game, Backstabbing is available to any class through Bart's training, so don't choose an orc just to get this skill (though orcs are a wonderful choice because of another skill). Regarding skill increases, Backstabbing isn't particularly hard to train, but you shouldn't make it a high priority. Still, high advance dice are rarely a waste to use, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Bridge Building&lt;br /&gt;Sigh. Okay, you already have the hatchet because you're a smart archer. You've spend hours of game time and plenty of food to chop a log. Now you don't use it for fletchery, but instead put it in the side pocket of your backpack (Isn't it hilarious that ADOM has weight, but not space restrictions?). Then chop a couple more logs. Now, climb down your favorite dungeon and find a river. You try to build a bridge segment. You fail, wood gone. Try again. Fail, wood gone. Try again, it worked! Now on to the next segment. But wait, you're out of logs? Chopping time again! Repeat to slowly increase your Bridge Building skill to a level with which you don't actually need to carry around ten times as many logs as you want to build bridge segments. Oh, screw this shit. Swimming is so much easier. Making ice bridges is so much easier. Teleporting is so much easier. There is one level in the game where you need either Bridge Building or several frost bolt spells, granted - but which one of these is the greater hassle? Wands of cold are so much easier to find than the time and patience to collect enough logs and Bridge Building skill points to build that particular bridge. This skill is pretty terrible. Don't, for the love of God, play trolls just to get it (the argument for playing trolls is Athletics, not Bridge Building). If you choose the carpenter quest, you get it anyway as a side reward for doing the quest (though I can only pity you if you ever need to use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) Cooking&lt;br /&gt;Now that's something every adventurer needs! Nothing like opening a good hurthling gourmet restaurant in the deepest depths of the darkest most dreadful and dangerous dungeon. Sarcasm aside, this skill isn't that bad. In case you haven't noticed, this skill enables you to cook stuff. Cooking stuff improves the nutritious value of corpses and raw meat or fish meat, lowers their weight slightly, and keeps them from rotting, at least for a certain time. This has several uses. For one, you can keep stat-increasing corpses around for a longer time in case you are too bloated to eat them all at once (although there are other ways to get those corpses all down your throat... There is a certain herb perfect for the bulimics among you). Also, there are some who like it if you bring corpses to them. Specifically, a certain druid rewards you for bringing him corpses of very powerful chaotic beings. If they're cooked, you've actually got a decent chance to get the corpses all the way to him. Still, all in all, it's a skill of low usefulness. But why not use it when you have it? Aside from being a hurthling, you can't obtain this skill for your archer except with a wish or a scroll or potion of education. If you do get it, you'll notice your hurthling starts out with a decent value already. Increasing it is probably kind of a waste of good skill advance points, but if you want to minimize the risk of ruining a chaos corpse you want to deliver later, go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Detect Traps&lt;br /&gt;This dwarven skill is really good, as it is the only way to find traps without actually walking into them or using a wand of trap detection. It is not a passive skill, though. Detect Traps is applied every time you 's'earch your surroundings. Of course, you don't walk around always searching your surroundings - unless you wear a ring of searching, something to consider if you have this skill - so you won't be able to find just every trap. If you have this skill, however, you should make it a habit to use it on every door. Doors have a much higher chance of being trapped compared to the dungeon floor, and sometimes even trying to open a door to see if it is locked may spring a trap. A higher skill level works better, but even a Detect Traps skill of 1 gives you the ability to find any trap - it's just that you have to spend a long time searching. If you want to use this skill with a ring of searching, you should have a high skill value because you don't make more than one searching check per turn with the ring. Since the skill is obtainable in-game theoretically (Yergius provides training in certain skills to members of his thieves guild), playing a dwarf for this skill is not as good an idea as it seems to be. However, it's the early game where you should be especially afraid of stepping into traps - they can potentially kill low-level characters - so the choice is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Find Weakness&lt;br /&gt;This skill is made of win and awesome. Simply put, this skill increases your chance to score critical hits, which cause double damage. The higher you climb in levels, the higher your damage becomes, and the greater is the additional damage your criticals will deal, to a devastating effect. Simply put, with this skill you will do a lot more damage overall. You'll want this at 100 more sooner than later. Find Weakness is obtainable only with a scroll or potion of education or through a wish. If you want to play an orc or dark elf to get it, don't hesitate - it sure is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g) Food Preservation&lt;br /&gt;This skill is shared by humans, drakelings, hurthlings and trolls, all of which get other non-archer skills as well. Food Preservation by itself isn't a bad skill. It slows down the decomposition rate of the corpses you carry around - both the cooked and uncooked ones - and, more importantly, increases the chance of monsters you kill actually leaving behind a usable corpse. There are quite a few monsters you will want to eat corpses of: giants, quicklings, blink dogs, dark sages (if illiterate), giant slugs, just to name a couple of the most desirable. How much you want this skill depends on how much you are ready to exploit it, obviously. Increase levels as you see fit - higher levels are only "needed" per se if you are preparing to engage a horde of monsters you want to eat the corpses of, like giant warbands or something. When deciding which race to play that has this skill, do check out the other skills. For the others, Food Preservation is unobtainable without a wish or scroll/potion of education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;h) Gardening&lt;br /&gt;Well, they can't all be winners, right? Let's keep this short. Only hurthlings get this skill. It is used to plant seeds, either herb seeds or plant seeds. Plant seeds produce trees - Rather useless, though it can keep you from returning the surface to chop trees. Herb seeds can grow to herbs, and this is indeed nice. However, you will find only about four to five herb seeds in a single game, if you're lucky. Do you really want to invest a lot of skill points just to be able to plant a couple of herbs when you can essentially achieve the same with a decent stack of holy water? I know I don't. If you do choose hurthlings, you probably won't because of this skill. Gardening is obtainable through Guth'Alak, but only if you already have Herbalism to begin with, since he will teach that skill first. And archers don't have herbalism. If you do have this skill, try to have it at a high value before trying to plant herb seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i) Gemology&lt;br /&gt;Yet another useful skill, though not as spectacular as Find Weakness or Athletics. Gnomes and trolls are trained in this skill. With it, they can identify gems better - there is a good chance that they will be able to discern the worthless pieces of glass from the actual jewelry. However, the really impressive effect is that a character with this skill will actually be able to find out gems from the rubble of destroyed walls. It doesn't even matter whether he mines the walls himself or lets a monster do it - he will be able to find gems afterwards, while characters without Gemology won't. Now, remember that there aren't only valuable gems and worthless pieces of glass - there are also crystals. Some heal, some make light and darkness, some even produce fireballs, and some are crystals of knowledge. These can, if blessed, increase Learning - sometimes by one, sometimes even by two points. Now imagine being able to mine a potentially infinite number of these and you can increase your learning score well into the twenties! This is especially nice for trolls, who suffer from a low Learning score anyway, but it is also very nice for gnomes. Since this skill is yet again unobtainable by means other than scrolls/potions of education or wishes, it is somewhat worthwhile choosing a troll or gnome for this skill (Especially since they've got other skills to offer). Start mining away once you hit a sufficiently high skill level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j) Literacy&lt;br /&gt;This is the only non-archer skill the high and gray elven races grant, though any other race also gets this skill if they have a decent Learning score (ten). Now, make no mistake about it - it is a tremendously useful skill, simply because not having means you can't read. No books, no scrolls. No reading books is bad enough as it effectively takes away your hopes of becoming a spellcaster worth anything. No reading scrolls, however, is a horrible handicap to endure - being illiterate for a whole game truly is a great challenge - and challenge games are for those that have already won, not for those still trying. Concerning scrolls, the value of the Literacy skill does not have any effect except on the scroll of literacy check, but that one is more of a joke item. The skill level does come into play when it comes to reading books. While reading spellbooks may be very difficult early on, it becomes more feasible the more levels you increase and the better your Literacy skill becomes. Simply put, invest points if you feel you can afford it in order to achieve spellcasting abilities. There is no need to play high elves or gray elves to get this skill. Not only is the chance high you'll get it anyway with humans or gnomes, you can also get the skill from an artifact potion Thrundarr has (but will only give out to the illiterate) as well as from corpses of certain opponents who were really good at reading when they were alive - spellcasters spring to mind. Dark ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;k) Metallurgy&lt;br /&gt;This is an orc specialty, but not one that scores many points on the usefulness scale. It enables you to identify pieces of ore - which is pretty pointless as they should be easily recognized by their weight. You can also 'a'pply it to find out the metal your items are made of. Only useful if you want to smith or find out whether an item of yours is susceptible to rust. Yet again, it isn't hard to figure that out even without this skill, and the knowledge isn't all that important anyway. Metallurgy isn't the reason you want to play an orc, that's for sure. I don't even think you should actually use skill advances on it - do it only if you've really got no other, more useful skill to increase. Metallurgy is unobtainable during the game. (Except for wishes and education stuff - you know the drill)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l) Mining&lt;br /&gt;A nice skill, though not terribly important. Trolls, orcs, dwarves and gnomes start out with it. Being knowledgeable in Mining means you can mine faster than those who don't have the slightest clue about what they're doing. In-game, this means that the Mining skill decreases the time you need to dig through stone with a pickaxe. Also, with this skill, pickaxes won't break on you that easily since you know how to use them. Now, how much you'll want this skill depends on how much you want to dig - and since there is both a spell and a wand that can do the digging for you, it isn't that important. Not to mention that you can always dig even without this skill if the need arises. Fast digging may be a way out of tough situations, but even with a high mining skill digging will take some time. Fast digging is, however, useful in combination with the Gemology skill: Trolls and gnomes have that. This skill is yet another skill you have to either wish for or get through a potion or scroll of education. If you want this skill, you'll still have to decide which one of the four races that get it to play, though. Spend points in Mining preferably after you've spent points in the more useful skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;m) Music&lt;br /&gt;Only drakelings start out with basic musical knowledge, god knows why. Music is an ambivalent skill. On the one side, animal companions can be very helpful. On the other side, the skill is useless unless you've got it at values at least over 70 or something. Drakelings start out at a single digit number and without an instrument, however, and when animal companions would be most useful they simply don't have the abilities to tame them. Now, at a high level, when your Music is finally maxed, there are still dangerous animals you'd rather have tamed on your side than opposing you, namely killer bugs. A tamed killer bug is a big help. However: You are not a bard. This means that you run the risk of companions turning on you - and you absolutely do NOT want to be surprise attacked by a killer bug. Nobody in-game will teach you this skill, either start with it, wish for it or luck out with a scroll or potion of education. This skill is the only incentive for choosing a drakeling over a human skill-wise (though there is still the Acid Breath to consider), and I don't feel it compensates for the crappiness of drakeling starting equipment compared to humans'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n) Pick Pockets&lt;br /&gt;This skill is a specialty of gnomes. Even though I don't particularly like this skill, I'm forced to admit that it is pretty powerful. The reason for that is that you don't steal the items the monsters have on them per se - instead every time you steal something with it a new item is generated. The only restriction is that this item can never weigh more than 10 stones. Do you know that this means? Gold and gems are possible. Any amulet, ring, potion, scroll or wand is possible. This includes artifact amulets and rings. Yes, it is entirely possible to get Preserver this way, or the ring of immunity. And even if you don't have this much luck, you'll still get a couple of very nice potions, scrolls and wands. Or an amulet of life saving. Or a ring of regeneration. Or... You catch my drift. The reason I don't like this skill anyway is that it's tedious to use. You have to 'a'pply Pick Pockets on monsters. To make the best use of this skill, you have to use it on *any* monster that has pockets, at least those that you can afford wasting a turn against - and these get of course more and more plenty as the game goes on and you grow more powerful. In the end, it's a question of playing style. Some use it religiously and love it; build your own opinion on this skill. I shall not forget, though, that having it and using it with success a certain number of times is a prerequisite to become a member of the thieves guild. Only members of the thieves guild can buy training from Yergius and obtain skills like Detect traps, Disarm traps, Pick locks. It is pretty damn useless on low skill levels, though, and it takes some investment to increase it and get proper success. Note that while this skill may be a minor early game helper, you shouldn't play gnomes just to get it, but let yourself become trained by Yergius. Since all you have to do to get this skill is be nonlawful when you meet up with him, this should be possible even on level 1. (If you're lawful, simply eat a baby or something to become neutral - or be a good roleplayer and don't even think about using it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o) Smithing&lt;br /&gt;Like Pick Pockets, some people swear by this skill. Only dwarves start out with it. Sadly, you can't just 'a'pply Smithing and be done with it, otherwise it would be more awesome than words could describe. First, you need an anvil, a hammer and a forge. Anvils are very rare to find - sometimes you won't have a choice but to either kill Kherab or Glod to get one. Forges aren't particularly plenty either. Like pools, herbs or shops, they can appear on any level of a randomly generated dungeon. You can also rent a forge from Glod (a bit tricky, but surprisingly nonchaotic is teleporting Glod out of his smithy and afterwards luring him off Dwarftown - after that, you can use his forge freely) or use one of the many forges in Darkforge. The problem is smithing takes time, and you don't want to hang around in corrupting (and otherwise dangerous) areas like Darkforge too much. The hammer, finally, is the easiest thing to find during the game. Large hammers and warhammers (maybe even huge iron hammers) work, regardless of metal.&lt;br /&gt;But even only with these three things and the skill, all you can do is remove rust from your items. You need ingots of the right metal to improve an item through smithing. Ingots itself can be randomly found, but the safer way to obtain them is to make them yourself, again with the Smithing skill. Since you are only an archer, not a weaponsmith, you can only make ingots out of pieces of ore. There are four different kinds of ore, and four different kinds of ingots. So how much you can improve an item is, in the end, directly dependant on how long you keep digging up walls to obtain the ore. Smithing takes time and work, but a [+0,+1] metal cap can potentially become a [+7,+7] metal cap or something eventually. Feel the power of this skill? Invest time and skill points in it and obtain the proper tools, and you just may have the key to winning the game comfortably in your hands. It isn't necessary do play dwarves to get this skill. It can be taught by Glod, the smith of Dwarftown, to anybody for a substantial, but not quite unaffordable amount of money. A dwarven archer could use the skill before reaching Dwarftown, but it is very unlikely that he manages to get the equipment needed before Dwarftown. So even though Smithing is very useful, I wouldn't play dwarves just for it. The smithing skill directly influences anything you want to do with it: Transforming ore into ingots, success in improving the items. So I would try to get it as high as possible before starting serious smithing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;Another general hint: If you want to make the best use of Smithing, you should be prepared to also make the best use of all the ore. Due to the rarity of eternium, you don't want to equip all-eternium equipment and enhance it. Some parts of your equipment should be iron, some mithril, some adamantium and some eternium. That way you don't have to throw away perfectly good ore. Dragon scale mail, for instance, is considered to be made of adamantium. So instead of wearing eternium plate mail, wear dragon scale mail and use your eternium to improve your eternium tower shield or something. Bracers in general are usually iron-made. Crowns of regeneration are iron-made and, if smithed up, a lot better than eternium caps. And if you already wear all of this stuff plus eternium tower shields and eternium boots, you should actually wear a mithril girdle instead of an eternium girdle just so you can do something with your mithril ore. (Actually, you'll probably want to wear girdles of giant strength and seven league boots the most... for these you can't use Smithing, so you should keep your scrolls of defense and protection around for them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p) Swimming&lt;br /&gt;A skill that is difficult to replace for those that don't start out with it, in this case any but humans and drakelings. Simply put, if your character can't swim, he really, really shouldn't try. In situations where the only way to escape from overwhelming opposition is across a body of water (one of the dungeon rivers, for instance), not knowing how to swim means death. The importance of this skill is greatest early on in the game, but it doesn't become obsolete by any means. For instance, movement speed in the Water Dragon Cave is directly influenced by the skill level in Swimming. Also, it's always better (and easier) to be able to cross rivers without wasting ice or teleportation spells (or, god forbid, investing in the Bridge Building skill - I pity anyone who has to build bridges because he can't swim). Lastly, ask yourself: How ridiculous is it if you can best ancient dragons in combat, but quiver in fear before a simple river? Invest skill advances in it until you feel safe traversing bodies of water. Having the skill at 100 is not necessary in most cases, but then, every point can prevent the "You are drowning!" message and thus save your life in a tough spot. While you should have this skill, luckily it's not necessary to play a human or drakeling to obtain it. Blup, the baby water dragon, can teach it to you, but only if you're nice to him. I heard he likes carrot juice... Of course, carrot juice may be common, but you won't always have the luck to find enough of it early on, and while your character is stuck without Swimming... Let's just say that, in any case, drakelings and humans have one thing less to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;q) Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the last skill in this extensive list, yet another gnomish specialty. This skill can confuse anyone you use it on. He or she will then stagger around aimlessly like any confused opponent. Since there are no confusion spells, the only way aside from mindcraft to confuse opponents is with this skill. A nice (but very chaotic) treat is that this skill can be used to "aggro" certain opponents inside a town without making all the others hostile. To them, it will seem that the victim of your Ventriloquism skill attacked you first, and they will even try to protect you. That's not the only use of the skill: You'll always benefit from very powerful opponents being confused. You spend a turn confusing them, they spend the next four turns or so recovering from confusion. I'm counting a couple hits more for you, though it's fewer if the opponent hits you by accident. Regarding skill points: If you want to use this skill effectively at all, you'll have to invest in it, as its chances of success are pretty low at low skill levels. If this skill strikes your fancy, you'll probably love playing a gnome, because there is no other way aside of wishes, scrolls or potions of education to get it. (Nice fact: Ventriloquism is even usable while confused, so you can use it to confuse the dopplegangers that confused you and kill them! Thanks to Narcolepcy for this piece of information.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;r) Acid Breath&lt;br /&gt;No, I'm not finished. Yes, wallow in despair as I add, in a revised version of this guide, another entry in the non-archer skill section that is not actually a skill, but a special ability only drakelings have! I've decided to include it because it deserves the same special attention as the skills when you choose your race. If you play a drakeling, you can press "m", then choose the direction with the well-known number prompt (with the 5 missing, as you can't attack yourself) and then spit a glob of acid in that direction. This glob of acid deals more damage with each level, and flies until it has used up all its damage, i. e. when it can't kill the first thing it hits, it will stop, but if it deals enough damage, the leftover acid hits the opponent after that. The Acid Breath has a very limited range, though. An exceptional property of this special attack is that it doesn't consume power points like spells would, but nutrition. It's like the food you eat serves as fuel. If you're low on food, you should be careful about using the Acid Breath.&lt;br /&gt;The Acid Breath is not something you should continually use, simply because its power scales up by level and is not dependent on how often you use it. As long as you use the Acid Breath, you don't train weapon skills, and frankly, missile weapons are a lot more powerful overall than the Acid Breath. Dopplegangers are NOT immune to the Acid Breath, though, so drakelings actually have few problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, when you get into situations where you absolutely *have* to eat something (curaria or alraunia spring to mind) but are bloated, you actually want to get rid of your absorbed nutrients ASAP. Stomacemptia doesn't work because you would have to eat that as well. The only solution? Being a drakeling and using the Acid Breath attack. So, to recap, it has two uses: Killing monsters and lowering satiation value while bloated when required. The first one can be covered in all but few cases by your missile weapons (and later on, wands fulfill the role of the breath attack just as fine), but the second one is hard to get. Luckily, you don't have to waste skill advances on this, as it isn't a skill (duh). Even though the Acid Breath is a drakeling racial ability, other characters can actually obtain it themselves, or at least a variation of it: There is a corruption that makes you exhale sulphur, which you can use just the same way you can use the Acid Breath. If you're far enough in the game to become corrupted, the corruption is probably only useful for the nutrient-lowering, though. A last bit of advice: If you play a drakeling archer, go to Terinyo and spend every goshdarned coin you have on large rations (of course, only so many you can carry), because you should have the Acid Breath ready to fill in against the more dangerous opponents until you find decent ammo and armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IV. Weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Short version&lt;br /&gt;This section is for those who don't want to look for my recommendations in the stuff below:&lt;br /&gt;Missile weapon: Bow *and* crossbow (switch regularly to get decent weapon skills in both)&lt;br /&gt;Melee: Shield and either Spear or whatever you find that does decent damage (but the shield is pretty much a given)&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is IMHO the best choice for all races, even hurthlings (Sling bonus?). Read below for why I think it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Arrows and quarrels&lt;br /&gt;The description says that race has a great influence on the preferred missile weapon. This is true to a certain level, since every race starts out with different ranged weapons. However, the definite best missile weapons (and very much worth switching to!) in the game are the bow and the crossbow. This is mainly because of the quality of the ammo you find: Arrows and quarrels come in all the higher metals and, most importantly, as "slaying" ammo. "Slaying" ammo (example: "arrows of dragon slaying") can be tremendously useful in defeating some very powerful enemies you will have to face. Slaying arrows and quarrels are pretty frequently found as random drops. An archer should pick up any stack of arrows and quarrels he stumbles across just for the chance that it is slaying ammo. (Note that all slaying quarrels are shown as brown instead of grey and weigh twice as much, so if you find a stack of brown missiles, walk onto it and notice it's quarrels and weighs 4s each, pick up those babies!)&lt;br /&gt;That alone would be sufficient reason to make bows and crossbows choice number one. Add the fact that you can make only arrows and quarrels with Fletchery. That should settle the case, right?&lt;br /&gt;Humans, high elves, gray elves, dwarves, gnomes and orcs start out with either bows or crossbows and use arrows or quarrels. Dark elves start out with a hand crossbow and use tiny quarrels, which is not exactly what you want, but at least trains the crossbow skill. Hurthlings, drakelings and trolls have to find bows, crossbows and sufficient ammo to switch to on their own, which makes playing them a tad bit harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Arrows or quarrels?&lt;br /&gt;You heard me say that the best weapons are the bow and the crossbow. Now you'll probably ask which one to pick. My advice is to train both. You will not achieve as high values in weapon skill, but this is offset by the fact that you will be able to use both slaying arrows and quarrels effectively - since slaying ammo is what will really win your battles. Another advantage of the bow and the crossbow is the possibility of getting Sun's Messenger and The Far Slayer as crowning gifts - unless you get one of them, both classes should be trained equally. In general it's like this: arrows are more plenty, but quarrels deal more raw damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Slings and rocks&lt;br /&gt;Now, a word about the sling, because there is also an artifact sling as a crowning gift. The sling has the advantage that there is a virtually endless supply of rocks for it. Yet, as an archer, you've got enormous skill as a fletcher, and should always be able to produce enough arrows and quarrels for your needs. Also, the rock is a rather weak missile - it doesn't do anything but deal 1d4 damage, which is hardly improved by any sling that isn't Whirlwind. Though it does come in a lot of variations (the best being (+3, 1d4+3), it cannot have magical properties like "of slaying" and "of penetration", which is possible for arrows and quarrels. There are sling bullets, granted - but the catch is that you can't produce them through fletchery. The few you find aren't a lot to work with, especially since they are smashed frequently. Also, while there is a wide range of monsters arrows and quarrels can "slay", there's only sling bullets of demon slaying. That's not bad, but still, no construct, humanoid, undead or dragon slaying means there's a fair number of opponents you have trouble damaging with sling bullets. Also, you can't throw sling bullets, which is a major disadvantage for hurthlings relying on their thrown rocks skill.&lt;br /&gt;Another factor is the weight. Rocks are 2.5 times as heavy as arrows and quarrels. Usually you don't have enough carrying capacity to carry around a decent stock of arrows, quarrels AND rocks. So my advice is sticking with the first two, except maybe if you actually found the artifact sling Whirlwind and are a hurthling, in which case I would probably still keep around bows and crossbows at a somewhat decent level solely to exploit the slaying ammo, because as I said - besides sling bullets of demon slaying (or sling bullets of slaying) there is no slaying power on a sling bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Other ranged weapons&lt;br /&gt;Let's talk a bit about other ranged weapons. There is the hand crossbow that uses tiny quarrels. Picking up tiny quarrels is not as important as picking up normal-type quarrels because they cannot be quarrels of -monster- slaying. (They certainly can be magical "of slaying" quarrels, but so can any missile or throwing weapon except rocks) Also, tiny quarrels do less damage than normal quarrels (still more than arrows, though). At least they increase the crossbow skill, which makes them useful for training against small fry. The other weapon skills, however, are not really worth it under normal circumstances. All the throwing weapon skills suffer from two weaknesses: First, you don't find much (Except for rocks), from which stems second: The melee weapons (For instance, crude knives) you can use instead of throwing weapons (Throwing daggers) have the problem that the game treats them as melee weapons (duh). The result: No automatic restocking with them once you run out of actual throwing weapons. You'd have to waste a turn equipping your stack of throwable melee weapons, say, crude knives. You can't always afford to waste a turn. All this makes it hard to train in throwing weapon skills, worsened by the fact that there are so many different throwing weapon skills, and so few throwing weapons for each skill. Add to this the unavailability of "slaying" throwing weapons (Again except for the magical "of slaying" attribute), and the tragedy is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The story is a bit different for "returning" weapons. Though they do not deal much damage, they help in training a throwing weapon skill tremendously. A boomerang (or scurgar of returning) is probably the best returning weapon there is, since scurgari can come in higher metals and in the "of death" variety. Spears of returning are wonderful in training up the throwing spears weapon skill to prepare for the arrival of the rune-covered trident, which is especially useful for wasting balors on D:50 if supported by a decent weapon skill. Curved throwing clubs and daggers of returning are nice toys, but in the end not really that useful due to the rarity of decent throwing weapons for these classes (In case of the thrown rocks and clubs class, utter unavailability).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Melee weapons&lt;br /&gt;Regarding melee weapons, you should definitely pick a shield for this class. The reason for that is that archers deal the most damage with their ranged weapon of choice, so the higher damage of a two-handed weapon is rather useless, while the DV gain of a shield is very useful. In your free hand, you can wear a one-handed melee weapon of your choice. You won't always be using ranged weapons due to ammo limitations (although Fletchery could change that), that's why training in a certain melee weapon skill is a good idea. Which melee weapon skill to train depends on the one-handed melee weapons you find (or hope to find). Swords are good in case you find a sword of sharpness, daggers in case you find a phase dagger, or anything else if you find a -weapon- of penetration - and who knows what kind of artifact you'll stumble upon? If you prefer extra DV over weapon damage, you can use a spear or go crazy entirely and use a second shield (after having obtained crazily high ammo stacks, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Ammunition&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your race, you start the game with low to average amounts of ammunition. Of course, the one you start out with is not enough for the rest of the game: You must find more. As with any item, ammunition can be randomly dropped by any monster. Especially in the early game, though, you can't rely very well on that. When you notice you run out of precious ammunition, it's time for desperate measures!&lt;br /&gt;First, there is a certain kind of trap that shoots arrows: It has a white-colored trap symbol (The spear trap has the same, be careful). If you're desperate, you can activate that trap on purpose with Strg-t, hoping that you can use the arrows it shoots at you afterwards. You'll take damage, of course (unless you've got high PV), and you accumulate arrows very slowly that way.&lt;br /&gt;The main source of arrows and quarrels is the Fletchery skill. Normally, you wait until you have the skill at a decent level and use your fletchery set on logs. Yet, you can also make ammo out of wooden sticks. Again, do that only when you've positively run out of ammo, because fletchery sets don't grow on trees. The gain is yet again low - usually you get very few arrows or quarrels from a wooden stick.&lt;br /&gt;Rocks can be accumulated by digging through walls or triggering stone block traps, if you're feeling desperate. Even if you don't have a pickaxe, you can go to PC:2 and let the ants dig through the walls, producing plenty of rocks. Also a good source of rocks: Collapsing tension rooms.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, one of most practical alternative sources of ammo are monsters. Not only can they randomly drop ammo just like other items; there are some monsters that have high chances of dropping certain kinds of ammo. An example is the goblin rockthrower: He will often drop rocks for you to use. A list of the ones that are sort of relevant in the early game:&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians: Found in the wilderness, so you can hunt them down if you can spare the game time. They're quite tough in the beginning, but become manageable - if you haven't run out of ammo, that is. Fire arrows and can drop very decent stacks. They also tend to drop short bows, their leaders even longbows.&lt;br /&gt;Black hurthlings: Rare, but weak, fortunately. Fire tiny quarrels and can drop very small stacks of these. They also drop hand crossbows.&lt;br /&gt;Dark elven archer: Rare and not total pushovers. Fire tiny quarrels and can drop very small stacks of these. They also drop hand crossbows.&lt;br /&gt;Gargoyles and Margoyles: Rare, pretty sturdy and can hit a low-level PC quite hard. If you eat their corpses, you get a small amount of rocks.&lt;br /&gt;Goblin rockthrowers: Common and weak. Fire rocks and can drop small stacks. They also drop slings frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Kobolds: Common and weak - if they're not large. Fire arrows and can drop stacks. They also tend to drop short bows.&lt;br /&gt;Ogres: Quite rare, and formidable opponents for low-level PCs. Fire rocks and can drop small stacks. They also drop slings frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Pixie archers: Rare and weak. Fire tiny quarrels and can drop small stacks.&lt;br /&gt;Quicklings: Rare, fast, how well you fare against them depends on your luck hitting them. Fire tiny quarrels. Because they are so fast, they can actually fire a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;Raiders: Rare, not that tough. Fire arrows and can drop decent stacks. They also tend to drop short bows and longbows.&lt;br /&gt;Ratling archers: Rare, not very tough. Fire quarrels and can drop decent stacks. Also a possible source of light crossbows.&lt;br /&gt;Because you have to kill these monsters somehow, it's best not to let your last missiles go out before gathering more. Generally, keep an eye on your ammunition status and if you drop below, say, 20 ammo left, take measures to obtain more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the game progresses, the ammunition situation changes dramatically. Sooner or later, if you religiously pick up any stack of quarrels and arrows you find just as I told you, you'll find yourself with tons of ammunition in your backpack. Now you've got another problem: Weight. Arrows and quarrels may weigh only 2 stones each, but once you have enough of them, they can really drag you down, especially since you want to carry other stuff as well (good ADOM players usually pick up every single potion, scroll and wand they find, just for the chance they need them someday...). Walking around strained or even very strained for a prolonged period of time will lead to dexterity loss. While that is somewhat less of a problem if you've got mosses of mareilon to repair the damage, it's still something to be avoided. Here is a couple of pieces of advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When you know you've got enough ammunition anyway, start picking out and dropping those that have no magical properties and are on small stacks, for instance your single cursed arrow (-2, 1d6-1) and your bundle of 2 blessed arrows (+1, 1d6-2) and so on. Small or even single stacks are very impractical because if you use them, you have to reload much sooner, and reloading costs a turn. It is a lot better to have 50 arrows in one stack than having to fire 50 single arrows one after another... Of course, since these useless stacks are small, you won't be getting a lot out of it unless you extend the limit of how small a stack can be to remain in your backpack. If you like gradually increase the size of the stacks you remove until your weight is tolerable once more. Just don't drop slaying or higher metal ammo (at least not eternium or adamantium), as these will come in useful for their high damage. Depending on your preferences, you might like to have arrows/quarrels of thunder or darkness, too.&lt;br /&gt;- If you know you won't be using rocks, then don't take them with you. They're too heavy. The same goes for throwing clubs. Even throwing daggers and scurgari weigh a bit too much for them to hang around in your backpack unused in great stacks. Make sure you only carry lots of ammunition for weapon types you'll be using. A boomerang here, a curved throwing club there is not gonna hurt, but having a heap of 4 throwing clubs (+0, 1d8) [120s] or a heap of 32 rocks (+0, 1d4) [160s] simply is a waste of precious space.&lt;br /&gt;- The same goes for tiny quarrels. If you've got enough normal quarrels, you don't have any need for the tiny ones. Drop them and your hand crossbows. (An exception could be made for tiny quarrels of slaying.)&lt;br /&gt;- An archer benefits greatly from the talents Porter, Master Packager and Beast of Burden because these allow him to take larger amounts of ammo with him. Archers also love girdles of carrying and want decent strength.&lt;br /&gt;- It is only good sense to have some spare missile weapons, but don't overdo it. You'll never need more than three missile weapons of the same type, and even three is pretty paranoid. One spare bow and one spare crossbow is usually enough, except if you're about to enter an area with high rates of item destruction, like the Tower of Eternal Flames, the Air Temple or the Blue Dragon Caves. Also, the need for spare weapons disappears completely once you get your hands on an artifact missile weapon.&lt;br /&gt;- Generally, if I feel uncomfortable getting rid of an item, I tend to keep it. You can survive pretty well being strained the whole game, you'll just never be super-dextrous - with mosses of mareilon, however, you can always get back to mid-twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. General equipment&lt;br /&gt;Archers love the same stuff everyone else loves. They love PV to survive enemy attacks. They love DV to avoid being hit. They especially love Speed, though, because being able to outrun opponents can often be the difference between victory and defeat. For the same reason, seven league boots are an archer favorite. Archers usually have trouble carrying all the stuff they want, so you should wear a girdle of carrying, or better, a girdle of giant strength. Regeneration items, like bracers or crowns of regeneration, are wonderful for any character. You should, in any case, take care not to wear too much equipment that lowers archery to-hit, especially not early on. A plate mail just isn't the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Items to wish for&lt;br /&gt;This is not the order in which you should wish for things, but serves rather as a pool of ideas in case you've got a wish and don't know what to do with it; it should be noted, however, that the first possible wish listed *is* a very good investment. The exact phrase you should use is in "". Note that when it comes to items, it's always a good idea to wish for them in plural: In most cases, you actually get more than one. When I didn't put the item in plural, it's because you only get one either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "amulet of life saving". For Khelly, because he rewards you with six scrolls of chaos resistance and is essential to the ultra endings.&lt;br /&gt;- "Find Weakness" skill if you don't have it already.&lt;br /&gt;- "arrows/quarrels of -foo- slaying" if you lack any before a fight. Sometimes the random number generator just loves to keep his humanoid slaying ammo to itself. The following types of slaying ammo exist and can be wished for: dragon, demon, humanoid, giant, jelly, construct, undead.&lt;br /&gt;- "potions of quickling blood", just to increase speed some more, though instead you should wish for&lt;br /&gt;- "Athletics", if you're not too advanced in levels already (or already have it).&lt;br /&gt;- "pairs of seven league boots". With this item, archers can potentially beat any opponent provided they have the space, since they'll be able to outrun ANYTHING except quicklings. Prime candidate for a wish after Khelly has been saved.&lt;br /&gt;- "rings of ice", so you may fare better in the Tower of Eternal Flames - a very nasty place otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;- "scrolls of chaos resistance", because they are always nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;- "wands of destruction" to finish the game.&lt;br /&gt;- Ultra ending stuff, if you're feeling ambitious. Check the guidebook for what you need.&lt;br /&gt;- "girdle of giant strength" to solve all your carrying problems - that is, until the next eye of destruction/annihilator.&lt;br /&gt;- "phase daggers" to deal with high-PV monsters, though you should likely have penetrating arrows and weapons.&lt;br /&gt;- "emperor moloch", if you have lots (and I mean LOTS, because this wish creates like 25 of them) of demon slaying ammo, yet your trollish archer still doesn't seem to get any decent XP. Penetration weapons also work against them, but you're asking for trouble if you melee thes guys. Also, when doing this wish, beware of greater molochs picking up hulking armors and wearing them. Due to a bug, they become super-fast all of a sudden if they do that and can easily destroy you.&lt;br /&gt;- "books of Strength of Atlas", provided you have decent Literacy and Learning, to solve your carrying problems indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;- "Herbalism" if you chose Healing earlier, though at the stage where you get the most wishes you don't need it that much.&lt;br /&gt;- "Alchemy", but only if you've got time left to train it to 100 and check the recipe for potions of gain attributes.&lt;br /&gt;- "scrolls of education" if you want a chance to get several skills, but that's just gambling. Note: You should wish for&lt;br /&gt;- "magical writing sets" if you've already seen scrolls of education or of chaos resistance and want to make more.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful armor, like "-color- dragon scale mails" or "eternium plate mails". Note that you have to specify the kind of dragon scale mail, it is not possible to wish for dragon scale mails and get one of every type. The following colors are possible: blue which grants shock immunity, white for cold immunity, black for acid immunity, and red to get fire immunity. There are no "karmic dragon scale mails", sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Archer crowning gifts&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know you don't actually benefit that much from knowing this information. There is no way to affect the choice of the random number generator anyway. But I think it's nice to know what to expect from your crowning. And since almost every archer far in the game will be stuck with one of these at some point, why not give them a little bit of attention?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) boots of the divine messenger&lt;br /&gt;+3/+3 DV/PV, increases Dexterity by 5, grants death ray resistance, paralyzation resistance and teleport control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never actually gotten this artifact before. It offers a couple of very useful magical properties. The DV/PV is rather low compared to what you can get with smithed up equipment, but pretty nice otherwise. The added dexterity is a very nice bonus. Death ray resistance, paralyzation resistance and teleport control are intrinsics every PC needs, as each of them can be invaluable when dealing with certain situations. Having Boots of the Divine Messenger on, I'd imagine, removes a couple of headaches you have regarding endgame equipment (especially the paralyzation resistance, because even the most powerful characters can be utterly destroyed by greater mimics without it). While all of the resistances and teleport control can be obtained in other ways (most famously trough the respective amulets or, in case of teleport control, rings or blink dog corpses), it would be nice to keep the amulet slot available for wearing amulets of rapid healing or the ankh. I'd consider this a lucky crowning gift, the only disadvantage of the Boots of the Divine Messenger as a crowning gift is the fact that the non-artifact seven league boots are already so useful to an archer. A luxury problem, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) The Far Slayer&lt;br /&gt;Adds +18 to crossbow to-hit and damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten this artifact before, though not as an archer crowning gift. Should you find it randomly, you can recognize it through its weight: It's the only heavy crossbow that weighs 350s. Simply put, it's the best crossbow in the game. It surpasses even the best heavy crossbow of accuracy by lengths. With this artifact, your quarrels become mighty quarrels o' kill. If you get this artifact, do not hesitate to specialize in crossbows more, and most importantly, use your fletchery sets on quarrels. With several hundreds of quarrels, the Far Slayer and Mastery (eventually Grand Mastery) in Crossbows you almost don't need slaying ammo anymore to be able to kill absolutely anything. With slaying ammo... Let's just say that this artifact also removes headaches, simply because you don't have to worry anymore whether you'll be able to compete in the endgame. Far Slayer is one of the best crowning gifts you can get as an archer, and having it is a reason to celebrate. And by celebrate I mean kill monsters to take their loot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Sun's Messenger&lt;br /&gt;Adds +15 to bow to-hit and damage and slays undead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have gotten this before, again not as an archer crowning gift. If you're an elf, you've got slightly higher chances to get this. It's easily recognizable by being called an elven longbow, though its weight is the same as a normal longbow. This artifact is more or less Far Slayer for arrows. The difference in to-hit and damage is more than made up by the undead slaying property. So what if you are slightly less likely to hit other opponents and deal slightly less damage compared to the Far Slayer? Being able to one-shot the more wussy undead (most importantly, ghost lords) and quickly defeat all the others more than makes up for that. With this artifact longbow, you can spout laughter and mocking at these pesky emperor liches! Well, until they defeat you anyway that is. What I said about The Far Slayer still holds true otherwise. If you get Sun's Messenger as a crowning gift, specialize in arrows and switch to arrow-making exclusively. On a side note, you can choose to sell your arrows and quarrels of undead slaying in the nearest general store. You won't be needing 'em anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d) True Aim&lt;br /&gt;+10 to-hit, deals 15d5 damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This silvery arrows (only one in the game) weighing the usual 2s is one of the crowning gifts you'll get if the random number generator hates you. Apart from its higher damage, this is regular ammo. It does not have slaying powers, higher critical chance nor does it even make a funny noise when it hits a monster or something else remotely interesting. It simply deals 15d5 instead of 1d6 extra damage (and is a bit more likely to hit than other arrows). 15d5. That's 15-75 damage. An eternium arrows deals, on average, 10-20 damage. That is quite a bit lower, granted. But now consider what I told you about the importance of slaying ammo. For the dangerous opponents, you shouldn't use eternium arrows or True Aim: you should have suitable slaying ammo ready, they're the biggest stick in your arsenal, not True Aim. And while it deals a fair bit of damage, if it's used and the opponent still lives (and he will unless he's a goblin or something), you have to use other arrows anyway. Sun's Messenger is so much more useful than True Aim it's not even funny, since it adds its damage to ANY arrow you shoot, including SLAYING ammo. If you get stuck with this shitty artifact, feel free to scream obscenities or whatever helps you cool down (I know it helped me). Just remember that life goes on, even if your crowning sucks. And at least you got an immunity, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e) Thunderstroke&lt;br /&gt;+8 to-hit, deals 20d4+8 damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember what I said about the silvery arrow? This obsidian quarrel may be of an entirely different color, but it sucks just like that for the same reasons. Thunderstroke deals 28-88 damage, which is quite a bit more than True Aim. Still a great deal better than the 12-32 of an eternium quarrel, but still no slaying powers, still only one-time usable in a given fight, still no funny noises. Due to the opposite appearance compared to True Aim, you may vary on the kinds of obscenities you scream if you get stuck with this garbage. (Maybe shout "Unholy piece of shit" instead of "Holy piece of shit"...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) Whirlwind&lt;br /&gt;+12 to sling to-hit and damage, grants resistance to fire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sling is easily noticed by the fact that it is covered in runes for some reason. Like Sun's Messenger and Far Slayer, it's the best missile weapon for its class you can ever hope to find. Unlike Sun's Messenger and Far Slayer, having it is no reason to specialize in slings, as I've explained in length in another section above. Also, the to-hit and damage bonus is not that spectacular compared to Sun's Messenger and Far Slayer, considering crossbows and longbows of accuracy can scale almost all the way up to +12 to-hit as well. If you're a hurthling archer and have somehow ended up using rocks until your crowning, you'll be glad to know that you can actually keep up the rockslinging until the end of the game and both success and Grand Mastery are almost guaranteed. The fire resistance is only of minor interest, but may be somewhat nice if you lack a fire resistance source for the ToEF and can't have your favorite missile weapon equipped all the time anyway. This crowning isn't as bad as the artifact missiles, but mostly it's also no reason to jump around in circles. Chances are good you stuff this in your backpack, keep on using bows and crossbows and forget about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V. Archer vs. Boss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember for all of these that blessed ammunition is a lot more useful than uncursed or especially cursed against most enemies - so do invest a fair bit of holy water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keethrax: Any type of ammo should work due to sheer archer damage. Humanoid slaying is almost instakill. Remember to take a light source with you, though, since Keethrax uses Darkness spells and you can't fire in the dark. Also, you should be resistant to fire so his magic barrages don't hurt you too much, and remember that he shoots missiles - berserking is risky.&lt;br /&gt;Hotzenplotz: Berserking archery to start off, humanoid slaying is instakill. When he manages to catch up to you, your best bet is to switch to coward mode and shoot off a couple of wands. That, or simply be faster (105 speed is good, 110 is better; remember to be unburdened and normally satiated, also remember that if you have lower than one third of your HP left, your walking speed increases if you switch to coward. Some ways to become fast: Choosing the Raven starsign, having high dexterity and/or Athletics, choosing Quick talents or Long Stride, wearing speed- or movement-enhancing equipment) in some way so you can gain some ground on him again. You DO NOT WANT to be hit by Hotzenplotz too often - his poison attack is strong enough to kill even the poison resistant once he gets a few hits in.&lt;br /&gt;Rehetep: Undead slaying ammo is the best way, together with fire spells. Rehetep is less of a problem in general, his servants can mean loads of trouble. Be prepared, optimally level 16 or even 17 (the pyramid closes for characters of a level higher than 16, but as long as you're in, you're free to gain as many levels as you want), preferably have as many different kinds of slaying ammo as possible to cover the widest base of opponents possible, be invisible, have the fireball wand Thrundarr gives to you.&lt;br /&gt;Nonnak: Humanoid slaying ammo, berserking archery. Be immune to ice and keep him at a distance, and you should be able to ace this fight.&lt;br /&gt;Griff: Undead slaying ammo (though I love teleporting behind him and pouring holy water on his grave - you still get XP as if you defeated him!)&lt;br /&gt;Snake from Beyond: No slaying ammo will fit, I'm afraid, except universal slaying ammo. The Snake can be beaten with normal ammo, too, but you'll take some beating as well. Clear out the area, have high speed so you can use hit and run tactics. Berserking archery helps if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;Skeletal King: Undead slaying ammo. Confusion resistance.&lt;br /&gt;Ancient Chaos Wyrm: Dragon slaying ammo. Only pack it out shortly before encountering the wyrm, or have a ring of ice handy, because you DO NOT WANT your dragon slaying ammo to burn before the ACW is dead - you have almost no other chance of beating that beast. Nasty is the fact that your bows and crossbows are also vulnerable to the fire. Archers need rings of ice. Also have potions of extra healing, since that shock attack hurts like hell and if you have a clear shot at the ACW, he gets a clear shot too. If you do have a clear shot, be invisible so you can afford to go berserk even with monsters nearby. It is possible to one-shot the wyrm with high weapon skill, blessed slaying ammo plus decent bow or crossbow and berserk tactics!&lt;br /&gt;Cat Lord: Humanoid slaying ammo. Also lots of potions of extra healing because that thing is trouble. No hit and run for you since he is so fast, and berserk mode is out of the question because of the same reason. Paralyzing him works wonders, because if he can't move, he can't hit you, and if your archer can't be hit, it's time for berserking! (Paralyzing is useful against any opponent, but hard to come by since it is only in wands - depending on how many cats you killed, the cat lord is going to be one of the best choices to use your wands of paralyzation on!) Note that the Ring of the Master Cat is an extremely useful artifact for archers, so you should avoid to kill cats.&lt;br /&gt;Master Summoner: Humanoid slaying ammo. First lure the Master Summoner into the hallway you dug, then get a bit of distance between him and you (By this time your speed should be halfway decent) and use berserking archery. With that and slaying ammo, he should be down in two hits, tops. You should drop valuable equipment you won't need in the fight on another level, and the stuff you will need somewhere outside the area where items are destroyed. Especially your slaying ammo should not be brought inside. Pick it up once you have left the item destruction area with Yulgash behind you, equip it, use it! And don't bother exploring the whole temple and killing every monster. It ain't worth the item destruction.&lt;br /&gt;Ancient Stone Beast: I hope you saved all that penetration ammo or found a penetrating weapon or phase dagger, 'cause you won't beat this monster through normal means. Best to deal with its earthen goons first. Lure the Ancient Stone Beast to another level so you can fight it one-on-one. Got no penetration? Then either retreat and find some or go crazy with berserking hit and run and hope for lucky damage rolls and criticals. This is IMHO the biggest pain in the ass for archer characters. Not because it is so dangerous - for a monster this late in the game, it doesn't hit that hard - but because it is so annoyingly hard to kill. If you've reached level 40, your class power is going to come in very handy.&lt;br /&gt;Chaos Archmage: Humanoid slaying ammo. Notice the pattern? Humanoid slaying is among the most useful types of slaying. Against the Chaos Archmage, remember the death ray resistance, the confusion resistance and the light source under all circumstances! (Just fought against him without confusion resistance. It's doable, but the stat decreases you get while wasting turns staggering around are horrible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your slaying ammo for the most dangerous enemies, like demon slaying against balors, dragon slaying against ancient dragons and wyrms (and Sraxxarrakex), giant slaying against giant kings and titans, jelly slaying against death oozes, undead slaying against emperor liches and lich kings. And an ultimate archer ending definitely includes finding a nice stack of humanoid slaying ammo and blessing it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I forgot the first time, I want to thank all the guys at the ADOM forum for their being tremendously nice and fun people to chat, discuss, and generally be with, my friends for generally kicking ass, my girlfriend for kicking the most ass (and for actually trying to play ADOM, if only to humour me), and Soirana, Nightmare, Narcolepcy, Hendar23, Giant Frog, Battle bunny and Mewto for their suggestions. If you others want to get special mentions too, why not point out some flaws of this guide to me? ;)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/8514998351581459654/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=8514998351581459654' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/8514998351581459654'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/8514998351581459654'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2007/09/guide-to-being-archer.html' title='Guide to being an Archer'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3710148354194913408.post-1695604430787313759</id><published>2007-09-13T18:06:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2007-09-13T18:43:53.144+02:00</updated><title type='text'>An introduction</title><content type='html'>If you've arrived here, you have either come from the ADOM forums over at the Hall of Fame, or walked a path too mysterious for me to fathom. Anyway, welcome to this blog that is not actually a blog. You'd think it would be something cool like a top secret nuclear weapon laboratory, but basically it is a place where I post hints and guides for ADOM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADOM stands for Ancient Domains of Mystery, a freeware role-playing game downloadable over at the official website &lt;a href="http://www.adom.de"&gt;www.adom.de&lt;/a&gt;. If this is new to you, it's a good time to go there, download the game and try it before browsing through anything posted on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've tried to play through ADOM, you'll have realized already that it is a very hard game, the very hard part being not dying. While in other, more mainstream games like Oblivion, Diablo, Neverwinter Nights or whatever you can either be resurrected or at least save your game and reload, there is no such luck in ADOM. When you're dead, you're dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And death lurks from behind all corners. Were someone to compile a list of the deaths you can die in ADOM, I could show it to you and you would be in awe at how long it is. But since there isn't and it would take too much time to make one, just cut straight to the awe. Anyway, of all these deaths, a single one is enough to keep you from winning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, ADOM is very fun to play by itself, you don't need to win it. But as the highscore list gets filled with characters who met their end at the hands of dangerous monsters, cruel, cruel fate or their own stupidity, you'll probably start to desire more. A greater destiny. To complete the quest to save the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is a document called the &lt;a href="http://www.andywlms.com/adom/"&gt;ADOM guidebook&lt;/a&gt; that can help you. In the most parts, it contains all the information you will ever need, though it can be a spoily read. This compendium of ADOM guides (that doesn't contain a single one yet, I'll comment on that later) shall be seen as some kind of an expansion the the ADOM guidebook. I plan to post guides that tell the reader that wants to hear it everything there is to be told about a certain class, so that they may take this class and actually, finally, win the game with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall make the start with the Archer guide... soon. Tomorrow, to be exact. Hopefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This introduction, however, shall announce an integral part of Adom Guides' policy: Contribution! Or do you think I actually want to write all the Guides for this website alone?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're an experienced ADOM player, why not write a guide yourself and send it to me? I'd be happy to put it up here, give people the opportunity to comment, and make this a place where as many people as possible can get that little step closer to victory...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/feeds/1695604430787313759/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3710148354194913408&amp;postID=1695604430787313759' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/1695604430787313759'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3710148354194913408/posts/default/1695604430787313759'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://adomguides.blogspot.com/2007/09/introduction.html' title='An introduction'/><author><name>Silfir</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15556090754583144358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>2</thr:total></entry></feed>
