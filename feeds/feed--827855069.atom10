			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7">WordPress 2.7</a> is available for <a href="http://wordpress.org">download</a>. The update packs a number of new features that any current or new WordPress user will welcome with open arms.</p>
<h3>WordPress Upgrader</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="http://5thirtyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/upgrade-27.png" alt="Automatic updates" /></p>
<p>WordPress 2.6 already offered immediate plugin updates directly from within the admin Dashboard. 2.7 adds a little more convenience by providing that same functionality PLUS core - <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7#WordPress_Upgrader">WordPress upgrades</a> - updates.</p>
<blockquote><p>The WordPress Upgrader will give you the option of downloading, installing, and upgrading to the latest WordPress version from your Administration Panel. </p></blockquote>
<p>Rest assured that the added functionality is for convenience purposes. Automatic updates are <em>initiated by a site admin</em> and are not done automatically behind the scenes.</p>
<h3>Significant Dashboard updates</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="http://5thirtyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/new-dashboard-27.png" alt="Admin Dashboard screenshot" /></p>
<p>This latest update will take some getting used - <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7#Navigation">navigation</a>, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7#Shortcuts">shortcuts</a>, and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7#Module_Control">controls</a>. Fortunately, most of the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7#Administration_Panel">primary functions are available front and center</a> (less digging through menus).</p>
<h3>Sticky posts</h3>
<p>Somewhere between normal posts and excerpts / asides. WordPress 2.7 provides a new editor option which allows users the option to &quot;stick&quot; post(s) to your front page. Great for featuring and protecting content that you do not want pushed off of the front.</p>
<h3>Grid Focus WordPress theme update</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="http://5thirtyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Grid-Focus-Demo.png" alt="Grid Focus updated for WP 2.7" /></p>
<p>A long overdue update for the <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/grid-focus">Grid Focus</a> theme originally released in May 2007. Grid Focus is WordPress 2.6 / 7+ compatible. If you want the threaded comments feature enabled, please update to WP 2.7 before installing. Save any personal modifications you may have made to the theme before updating (most of the code was re-written and cleaned up). More details, a summary, and demo of the update can be found on the <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/grid-focus">download page</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What started out as an experiment transformed into a permanent alternative replacement for my standard living room furniture. Last year, my favorite pieces of furniture was a blue sectional and clean white steel coffee table. Ask me what my favorite pieces of furniture are today, and I won&#8217;t hesitate to utter the name <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/">Sumo</a>. </p>
<p>Last <a href="http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2008/06/13241/">June I shared my experience</a> with Sumo Lounge Gear - the incredible <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/sumosac.php">SumoSac</a>. A giant plush lounge bag suitable for two. Since then, Sumo has unveiled an even larger gigantuan bag called the <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/sumosacG.php">Sumo Giganator</a>. If any company made anything any bigger, customers would need to accept the fact that come moving day, their favorite bag wouldn&#8217;t be leaving the house. The line of bags come in a wide array of sizes and materials to fit the need of any individuals looking for a comfortable alternative to the sagging couch in front of the television.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://5thirtyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sumo-sleepers.jpg" alt="Sleeping on Sumo Lounge Gear" /></p>
<p>The entire Sumo Lounge Gear line is an incredibly versatile, well constructed, family of affordable bean bags [that aren't really filled with foam beans]. Plush, comfortable, and preferred by all ages. Sumo offers bags between $149 and $399. Compare that to their competitor prices at $250 to $1000.</p>
<p>Jump on one, hurdle yourself off the couch into one, throw your niece and nephew across the room into one, lounge and fall asleep in one, let your dog disappear into one, prop one up in front of the TV + Xbox, or make a mess on one and throw the cover into the wash to start all over. <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/">Sumo Lounge Gear</a> is the perfect answer to the question: &quot;How can I get something that looks cool, is comfortable, and doesn&#8217;t carry a high price tag?&quot;</p>
<p>Get the same bags in my living room: <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/sumosac.php">Sumo Sultan</a> x 2 and the <a href="http://www.sumolounge.com/sumosac4ft.php">Sumo Gamer</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Boxing day blowout sale December 26th through January 15th! Mark your calendars for an extra 10% - 15% off.</p>
