			<title><![CDATA[ 10 Things You Need to Know About PlayStation Home ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/home7.jpg" width="807" height="544" style="display:block;float:none;" />The PlayStation Home Open Beta <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5107585/playstation-home-open-beta-is-out-now">is out</a>, and it's simply the best way to taste what Sony has in store for the PS3 over the coming years. Here are the ten things you should know.</p> <p><strong>1) PlayStation Home is out, but in Open Beta status.</strong> If the world of Home feels sparse or buggy, Sony wants you to remember that it's not really out yet, even though it's actually been released to the public. The final version of PlayStation Home with all of the features Sony has teased is promised for next year.</p> <p><strong>2) It's not a firmware update.</strong> So to download PlayStation Home, don't go searching around System Update for the software. The option to download Home is built right in to the XMB under Network. And while the initial download is just 77MB, each area takes another 10-20MB. The system requires that you reserve 3077MB of storage for all of Home.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/pshomedload_01.jpg" width="807" height="631" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <strong>3) Chatting has mixed results.</strong> Talking to others is fairly mediocre in quality but is interestingly proximity-based, just like in real life. So if someone is speaking near you, you hear it, whether you want to or not. (Luckily, I was able to mute the idiot shouting "I'm a venereal disease" over and over.) Also of note, if you have friends in a different territory than you live, they won't be seen in public spaces, but you can invite them to your apartment to "chat."</p> <p><strong>4) There will be microtransactions, lots of 'em.</strong> Diesel is the partner Sony has been most vocal about for the time being, with pieces of their branded clothing available for $1-$2. And if you want to expand beyond your base apartment, a Summer House will be available for $5.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/home3.jpg" width="807" height="482" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <strong>5) There are lots of dudes.</strong> Lots of them.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/home2.jpg" width="807" height="455" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <strong>6) Free Games!</strong> PS Home features free bowling and billiards along with a few choices in arcade games. Your avatar actually walks up to a particular arcade cabinet before playing games like a <em>Breakout</em> clone or a gimped version of Ecochrome. Interesting in theory, so-so in execution. And only one guy on a machine at a time.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/home1.jpg" width="807" height="424" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <strong>7) Game Spaces will be limited for now, but available in the Open Beta</strong>. These are the themed areas for your group to meet before loading a game. The only two spaces accessible at launch will be ‘Far Cry 2‘ and ‘Uncharted.‘ Each also features puzzle-like objects to interact with and strategic objects like maps for strategic pre-planning.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/uncharted_1_01.jpg" class="center" style="display:block;"><br> <strong>8) Video sharing is not yet available.</strong> The Open Beta will be missing one of Home's potentially coolest features, the option to share your media with others to enjoy virtually. Whether it's technical or licensing issues that are holding Sony back on this feature is unknown.<br> <strong><br> 9) The theater works great...for an ad.</strong> You can sit down to watch a movie...if there were a movie. For now, you can watch a loop of a preview for Twilight and an accompanying music video. The quality is that of typical flash video, though the video screen does render smoothly into the 3D background.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/home5.jpg" width="807" height="454" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/home4.jpg" width="807" height="377" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <strong>10) PlayStation Home is not Second Life.</strong> You cannot <em>create</em> anything in PlayStation Home. You can only buy it. Sure, you have your apartment to decorate as you see fit and you can choose the clothes your avatar wears, but these options are based upon preselections&mdash;preselections that Sony has complete control over. There are five shirts available to men in Home and you can't change the color. If Home were Second Life, not only would there be more shirts, but those shirts would be covered in animated dildos dancing to the beat of a live vocalist.</p> <p>Home could be a great platform one day, but Sony needs to provide the content to back it up. And right now, anything short of more advertising is lacking. In Home, I feel like a prisoner&mdash;my uniform matches all the other inmates as I walk around beside the other inmates endlessly with nothing to do.</p> <p>[Additional sources: <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/12/touring-playsta.html">Wired</a> and <a href="http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/12/11/sony-answers-some-key-playstation-home-questions-dodges-others/">MTV</a>]</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Best Xmas Tree Ever Has All the Sci-Fi Decorations You Can Imagine ]]></title>

Earthlings, behold the best Xmas tree ever, decorated using every single sci-fi electronic figure in the Universe, as the gallery shows. From Star Wars to Star Trek, the mind boggles.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"> galleryPost('stridertree', 3, ''); </script></p> <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/scifitree2_gizmodo.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/scifitree2_gizmodo.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;"></p> <p>The tree belongs to own of our dearest commenters and his wife, and the first ever to hold a star in Gizmodo: Strider. Or like he wants to call himself in real life: Mike. As you can see, it's absolutely spectacular, even overwhelming with all that sound.</p> <blockquote> <p>In 1997, when Hallmark started the light and sound Star Trek ornaments, my mom bought all my brothers and sisters (including my then-girlfriend) the original NCC-1701 Enterprise ornament. Every year since then my wife and I have tried (and I'm pretty sure succeeded) to collect them all, including the Star Wars ones, although I'm not actually sure how complete our collection is at the moment. We don't keep track, we just get the ones we want, which is usually all if not most of them.</p> <p>I use eight individual strings of lights to spread out the electrical load of the light-powered ornaments. It takes at least a few hours to set the whole thing up. It's so worth it though. We're up to two of those large plastic bins of the ones that get put away. Every year we decide to keep a couple more of the battery operated ones out. -I want the big TIE fighter for my desk, personally.</p> </blockquote> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/arts_culture/Nerdgasm_Best_Xmas_Tree_Ever_Has_All_Sci_Fi_Decorations'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>[Big thanks for Mike and his wife, Melissa—who put the decorations up— for the amazing job of documenting the decoration of their tree for us]</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Do the New MacBook Pros Have Faulty Nvidia Graphics Cards? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/macbookproboom.jpg" width="807" height="430" style="display:block;float:none;" />We already know the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5099671/beta-culture-apple-acknowledges-video-problems-in-new-macbooks">new MacBook Pros have video problems</a>, so when <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/921/1049921/inquirer-confirms-apple-macbook-pros-have-nvidia-bad-bump-material">the Inquirer says</a> their Nvidia GeForce 9600 GTs use the same faulty material that <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5021713/lots-of-nvidia-laptop-graphics-cards-are-overheating-dying">killed earlier graphics cards</a>, it doesn't look good.</p> <p>So a quick recap on the original issue and the back and forth between Nvidia and the Inquirer: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5021713/lots-of-nvidia-laptop-graphics-cards-are-overheating-dying">Nvidia admitted back in July</a> "significant quantities" of notebooks are defective, built and packaged with "weak" materials that are leading to them to overheat and fail at a "higher-than-normal" rate, but declined to state which cards specifically.</p> <p>The Inquirer said <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5023963/inquirer-every-nvidia-graphics-card-with-g84-or-g86-chipset-is-ready-to-die">every single G84 and G86 card was affected</a>, and a GPU apocalypse was coming, and indeed, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5063105/defective-nvidia-graphics-cards-confirmed-in-desktops">more</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5038776/dell-extends-warranties-for-laptops-with-failing-nvidia-chips-while-nvidia-stays-mum">more models</a> from different manufacturers came to light with the problem. The previous-gen MacBook Pro was actually the last one revealed to be smitten by the plague, like the final Cylon or something, since <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5061605/apple-confirms-failing-nvidia-graphics-cards-in-macbook-pros-offers-free-repairs-and-refunds">Nvidia was reportedly less-than-honest about the problem to Apple</a>. Nvidia continued to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5037070/proof-nvidia-desktop-g86-graphics-cards-affected-by-materials-defects">reiterate most chips are just peachy</a>.</p> <p>Nvidia says that its current chips don't use the weak materials, which produce what are called <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/378/1004378/why-nvidia-chips-defective">"bad bumps."</a> Obviously, the Inquirer thought they were lying, so they took a new MacBook Pro to a lab, cracked it open, sliced apart the G96 GPU and checked it out under a scanning electron microscope with an X-ray microanalysis system.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/9600graph.jpg" class="center" width="807" height="544" style="display:block;float:none;">The result? The Inq says the same old bad bumps, which were composed mostly of lead, are there in the GeForce 9600 vs. the new, good eutectic bumps that are in the GeForce 9400M (the MacBook and MacBook Pro's chipset/integrated graphics). Or more straight up, "The 9600 is unquestionably using 'bad bumps', directly contradicting the statements from Nvidia...It suggests that there are 15-inch Macbook Pros being sold with 'bad bumps', the same materials that brought down so many HP, Dell and Apple parts, both laptop and desktop."</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/9600bump.jpg" class="center" width="640" height="480" style="display:block;float:none;">Naturally, I asked Nvidia for their reaction to Charlie's Inq piece, and a spokesperson reiterated that the GeForce 9600 GT graphics cards in the MacBook Pros "don't have bad bumps at all." He said that, "yes, they're lead bumps" but "hundreds of millions of chips have lead bumps." And it's "a different material set [from the faulty one], one they transferred to earlier" that's used in the 9400, 9600 and 9800.</p> <p>Of course, the Inquirer's whole point is that Nvidia is lying. So, who to believe? Well, here's what we know for sure. When I talked to Nvidia about the original run of faulty chips, and why we saw it some systems and not others, they told me it was largely a thermal issue, which, in combination with the weak materials, would cause the kiss-of-death cracking&mdash;so you'd see it in systems that ran hot, in other words, like some notebooks or <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5037070/proof-nvidia-desktop-g86-graphics-cards-affected-by-materials-defects">slimline desktops</a> with poor circulation. (Which is why the "fix" for the problem <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5030036/dell-issues-bios-update-to-keep-nvidia-geforce-cards-from-frying">were firmware updates</a> that cranked the card's fans sooner.)</p> <p>We further know that the 9600 GT cards in the MacBook Pro are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5099671/beta-culture-apple-acknowledges-video-problems-in-new-macbooks">currently having problems</a> that appear to be heat-related, causing them to lock up and launch into the "black screen of death." Also, Nvidia pointed out that there aren't a whole lot of labs properly equipped to do the kind of analysis the Inquirer commissioned&mdash;you can't just walk down to your local Discovery Channel store&mdash;though they left it at that.</p> <p>And that's about as definitive as we can get, for now. Two things bother us: We would've liked a slice and dice of one of the previous-gen bad chips to directly compare to the new, supposedly bad one. And Nvidia's subtle implication that the people with labs equipped to perform this kind of analysis have a vested interest in the outcome also has the magical effect of shielding them from the results.</p> <p>You can believe Nvidia. You can believe the Inquirer. I just know that given the thermal problems that already clearly exist, I really hope the Inquirer is wrong. <em>If you know something about this you wanna share, <a href="mailto:matt@gizmodo.com">email me</a>.</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ The New and More Reader-Friendly Gizmodo ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/gizpage.png" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="800" height="261" style="display:block;float:none;" />As you can hopefully see, we've redesigned our Gizmodo front page yet again to make it easier for <strong>you</strong> to find the stories you want to read. We think you'll like it, and here's why.</p> <p>First, the condensed page allows us to keep more stories on the front page (about 200% more!) for a longer period of time. This means you'll no longer have to pick up on page two after you've come back from lunch. You'll also notice a decrease in page load time, which also helps you get to where you want to be that much faster.</p> <p>What's nice is that if you really don't like the new format, you can click up there in the "View" dropdown and go back to the old page format with stuff expanded.</p> <p>The new layout also allows us to do things like call attention to really IMPORTANT stories, for example the Zune Phone being announced or a real life Batman sighting. Readers who are subscribed to our email alert list will also get notifications via that method as well. We'll also have some new features as well rolling out in the coming weeks, keep an eye out.</p> <p>Hopefully you'll like what we've done, but you should definitely let us know here in the comments how we can improve even more. Thanks!</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Dealzmodo Hacks: 8 Ways To Get More Miles Out Of Your Old PC ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/oldpc-retrofit.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="703" height="370" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/hardware/Hacks_8_Ways_To_Get_More_Miles_Out_Of_Your_Old_PC'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>Before you drop the dough on a whole new system, here's a list of upgrades for squeezing a few more months, years even, out of ol' faithful, during these trying economic times.</p> <p>If your Windows PC is seriously Dark Ages material, you might want to try converting it into <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5085572/dealzmodo-hack-get-some-use-out-of-your-useless-old-pc">something altogether different</a>, like an NAS or media center. But stick around here if you're riding that thin line between acceptable day-to-day use and the scrap heap and try these quick and cheap upgrades first.</p> <p><strong>1. Reinstall Your OS</strong><br> Over the years, operating systems inevitably pick up random pieces of clutter that start hogging your limited resources and bring your system to its knees. Forget spyware and malware cleaners—they're often just as guilty of mucking up your machine.</p> <p>No, the best way to start fresh is of course to reinstall Windows. It's a pain, but thankfully there are a number of tools that will make the process easier.</p> <p>• <a href="http://www.nliteos.com/">nLite</a> and <a href="http://www.vlite.net/index.html">vLite</a> for XP and Vista respectively are great tools for not only automating a large chunk of the reinstall process, but also for slimming down and customizing the installation to make sure you have a version of Windows that's optimized for your old hardware</p> <p>• Kevin from Lifehacker also has a great guide <a href="http://lifehacker.com/386526/slipstream-service-pack-3-into-your-windows-xp-installation-cd">for slipstreaming XP Service Pack 3</a> onto a custom install disc so you can avoid hundreds of Windows Update downloads after you reinstall using the older XP disc you probably have lying around.</p> <p>• There are a ton of tools to help back up your data before a reinstall, but an easy no-brainer (especially if things have gotten so bad that you can't boot) is to boot with a Linux live CD like Ubuntu and move your files from your Windows volume to an external drive before wiping it.</p> <p><strong>2. Buy a New Graphics Card</strong><br> A huuuuge part of what we humans perceive as slowness while using a computer are delays and hang-ups in the graphical UI—something that doubling or quadrupling your available video memory and beefing up your GPU rendering muscle will go a long way in alleviating. Graphics cards are super cheap these days, so think about dropping $100 or less on a new video card for your system and see where that gets you before going full monty on the replacement. As you probably well know, <a href="http://Newegg.com">Newegg</a> is the place for cheap hardware—for $150 or less you can do very well with a variation on the solid Nvidia GeForce 9800 GT or ATI Radeon HD 4850.</p> <p><strong>3. Max Our Your RAM</strong><br> Many of you may be saying "duhhh" here but this can't be more of an important point—if you haven't maxed out your RAM yet, do it. Now. Just like graphics cards, RAM is super cheap, especially if you're running a common motherboard configuration. So head to <a href="http://crucial.org">Crucial</a> or <a href="http://www.macsales.com/">OWC</a>, have it scan your system, and price out some new RAM sticks for you. Remember—matched pairs (in terms of size) are always faster than unmatched, and to taste every last bit of a 4GB upgrade, you'll <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5076473/giz-explains-whats-so-awesome-about-64+bit">need a 64-bit OS</a>.</p> <p><strong>4. Get a Bigger Display</strong><br> This one is more of head game than an actual upgrade, but I swear, every time I hook my laptop up to the big 22" widescreen monitor here in the office, my machine feels about a year or two faster. Something about having more screen real estate just helps. Plus, once you do finally get a brand new screamer, you can just swap it right over. Cheap LCDs are our daily <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/dealzmodo">Dealzmodo Roundups</a> bread and butter, so keep an eye out there for a good bargain on a decent brand.</p> <p><strong>5. Get a Bigger, Faster Hard Drive</strong><br> You can never have too much storage. So abiding by this rule, a few bucks spent on a new HD will at the very least free up more space for virtual memory on your boot volume. You could also look at a 10,000RPM drive for a desktop or a 7,200RPM drive for your laptop, which will undoubtedly be faster than your stock drive. Don't worry so much about your new HDD's cache size so long as its at least 8MB (which is common), as anything higher tends to offer diminishing returns. For everything else you'd want to know and more about getting a new hard drive, check out <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5106129/giz-explains-everything-you-need-to-know-about-hard-drives?skyline=true&s=i">yesterday's Giz Explains on HDDs</a>.</p> <p><strong>6. Optimize Your Boot Time</strong><br> Another psychological downer is waiting 5 minutes for your machine to boot. Again, Lifehacker to the rescue: Less than a month ago, Gina published a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5087101/the-complete-guide-to-speeding-up-your-pcs-startup">complete guide to streamlining your Windows startup speed</a>—make that your first stop.</p> <p><strong>7. Clean Out Your Browser</strong><br> Your web browser is where you spend most of your time—and just like Windows, Firefox can get bogged down in bloat. If you have a ton of extensions installed that you never use, disable or remove them. You can also dive into the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5041335/useful-firefox-3-configuration-tweaks">world of about:config</a> and follow the numerous guides to tweaking FF's guts for more speed.

			<title><![CDATA[ Windows Mobile Browser Battlemodo: Can You Get the Real Internet? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/winmophones.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="807" height="489" style="display:block;float:none;" />Many of you asked for a re-do of Windows Mobile browser testing after <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5090988/mobile-browser-battlemodo-which-phones-deliver-the-real-web">our Battlemodo declared the platform beyond worthless</a> for surfing. So here it is, the internet running on Windows Mobile's finest hardware.</p> <p>Before we get started, a quick note on the last Windows Mobile test, and what we're doing differently here. Some of you guys complained that the Samsung Epix was a crappy, slow piece of hardware. However, according to Laptop, <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/cell-phones/samsung-epix-att.aspx?mode=specs">its 624MHz Marvell processor and 128MB RAM</a> are specs that <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/cell-phones/sony-ericsson-xperia-x1.aspx?mode=specs">just about</a> on <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/cell-phones/htc-fuze-att.aspx?mode=specs">par</a> with the three phones clamored for in the comments. Still, you get your wish: Here we lined up the Sony Xperia X1, HTC Touch Pro (AT&T's Fuze) and the Samsung Omnia, and put them through the same tests. On the Epix, for Opera testing, we went with v8.65 in order to not use beta software. (<a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/download/">Opera's own site</a> lists 8.65 as its most recent stable version.) Here, all the Windows Mobile hardware we've added to the test have Opera 9.5 built right in.</p> <p>So without further explanation, here are the numbers&mdash;time to load the page, and how accurately it was rendered using Firefox 3 as a reference:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/WinMo_3G_Browsing.jpg" width="667" height="351" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/WinMo_Wi-Fi_Browsing.jpg" width="616" height="314" style="display:block;"><br clear="all"></p> <p>As you can see, the Xperia, Fuze and Omnia are about on par with the Epix when it comes to IE (they suck!), though Opera Mobile 9.5 obviously crushes 8.65 when it comes to speed and competency. I asked Opera why I saw the performance differences between the three phones and they admitted that there are some tweaks, which "are mainly with making our browser work best on the different devices." So, let's look at the new phones and see how they rate against the Epix:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/xperia.jpg" class="center" width="807" height="563" style="display:block;float:none;"><strong>Xperia X1</strong><br> You probably noticed in the chart that load times are longer over Wi-Fi in a few spots. This is because it would randomly hang, not loading data, for up to 20 seconds. The Xperia was aggravating because its touchscreen seemed to be the least responsive of the three, making navigation a pain, though its optical mouse came in handy for zipping around pages, and it worked better than the Omnia's. One other annoyance is that Opera blocked its virtual symbol keyboard from coming up, which made it hard to enter one of the URLs. It falls smack in the middle.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/touchpro.jpg" class="center" width="807" height="579" style="display:block;float:none;"><strong>HTC Fuze</strong><br> I had the smoothest overall experience with the Fuze, and would be my closest thing to a recommendation. Its touchscreen was responsive, which made double tapping to zoom and pan around pages fast and mostly intuitive in Opera Mobile. Having symbols mapped directly to the keyboard is a big time saver while punching in URLs. This is good, since it seemed to be the slowest of the three, both over 3G and Wi-Fi. Sluggishness aside, the web experience is markedly more usable than the other two new phones.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/omnia_01.jpg" width="807" height="537" style="display:block;float:none;"><strong>Omnia</strong><br> The all-touchscreen Omnia, despite being the fastest over 3G in a number of cases, was a nightmare. During the 3G tests, it managed to crash Opera on three of the six pages tested. I also had tons of Wi-Fi issues. Eventually I was told by Samsung that VZAppZone, Verizon's pseudo-app store that's all but pre-installed on the phone (after you fire it up, it installs), was breaking the Wi-Fi. (On the Epix in the previous showdown, I was later told by Samsung that installing Opera is what broke Wi-Fi for IE. So, uh, Samsung maybe...oh, whatever.) Also, its portrait keyboard has keys so ridiculously skinny, they'd remind anorexic models not to eat. When Opera did work and a page was actually loaded, it was the snappiest at moving around the page. But overall, yeesh.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br> So where would I slot Opera 9.5 overall if I were to slide it into the previous browser battle? I'd give it a B-. It has a great, desktop-y UI (though I wish a few of the buttons were a smidge bigger, taking into consideration fat fingers and the inadequacies of resistive touchscreens). It's really competent, and it has a solid zoom metaphor, with the double taps usually working like a charm. And it has extras like tabs. But, and this is the big but, it still doesn't feel quite as smooth or instantly responsive as Safari or Android's browser. It's clearly an OS issue, though, not an Opera one.</p> <p>Speaking to that, testing these three phones actually took longer than it did to test the six in the original Battlemodo, entirely because of how much wrestling I had to do with Windows Mobile. I've used close to a dozen Windows Mobile devices over the last year, and it's still a bitch.</p> <p>If you haven't noticed in our reviews of Windows Mobile phones, we've basically ceased comparing to them anything but other WM phones, in a wishful attempt at dulling our totally appropriate disdain for the OS, lest the review essentially turn into <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/wm6-sux/first-moto-q9m-unbox-and-grope-mini+review-and-gallery-292281.php">one giant bitchfest</a>. They're clearly off in their own world of performance and function.</p> <p>Even ceding the point that Windows Mobile is somehow more functional than the iPhone or Android, it's like comparing one of those 100-in-1 kitchen gadgets that'll blend, slice, dice, toast, saute, braise, set the table, clean the dishes AND suck you off while it's doing all that to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waring-MX1000R-Professional-Horsepower-Blender/dp/B0001XASVW/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1228975737&sr=8-1">Waring MX1000 blender</a>. It doesn't matter how much the all-in-one gadget can technically do if you can't figure out how to use it, and it performs every task with only mediocre results.</p> <p>If the iPhone ran half as poorly as Windows Mobile phones, Apple haters would (rightfully) scream as loudly as Apple fanboys do about Vista. If any BlackBerry was as much of a flustercuck, reviewers would trash the crap out of it. I'm sorry, but at this point, any apologist left defending Windows Mobile is either delusional or full of crap&mdash;either way, not worth listening to.</p> <p>I won't touch another Windows Mobile phone until WM7 or at least 6.5, no matter how awesome the hardware looks. Call me when it runs Android.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ <i>Terminator Salvation</i> Set Visit: It Just Might Not Suck ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/term-8_01.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" style="display:block;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/movies/Terminator_Salvation_Just_Might_Not_Suck'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>Good news, everyone! <em>Terminator 4</em> might not suck. I can’t know for sure without actually seeing the film, but I do have a good feeling about it, having flown to New Mexico a few months back to explore various hot, dusty sets and meet cast and crew.</p> <p>The three themes I heard over and over during my set visit were “Batman,” “Macs,” and “T3 sucked.” It was like attending some strange but beautiful techno-mass that was worshiping Gizmodo’s own holy trinity.</p> <p>“In the same way Warner Bros. took Batman and really turned the franchise on its head and made it really dark and really cool, we’re going through the same whirl with our Terminators,” production designer Martin Laing explained to us in front of a wall of concept art.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/term9.jpg" width="807" height="390" style="display:block;float:none;">He showed us robots, lots of them. But unlike the slick and crafty T1000, these machines are constructed of dark, dirty alloys. They’re big. They’re bad. And they’re driven by crude mechanics like pistons. The T600, a completely new, Frankenstein-ian Terminator is evidence of this trend. Standing over seven feet tall and modeled to be the product of a Soviet tank factory, the T600 has a blatant disregard for personal grooming as his rubber skin cracks away in the desert heat. He makes the Schwarzenegger T800 look like a sleek sports car, a fitness model... a politician.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/term2.jpg" width="807" height="378" style="display:block;float:none;">“Imagine your first Mac,” director McG explains later over the bounties of the crafts services. (That's movie-talk for free food.) “You had a IIcx. You had two megs of memory. And now you have a MacBook Air. It’s leaner, faster. Technology is more and more space efficient and that’s the language we’ve been following with the machine development.”</p> <p>Indeed, McG and Laing both mentioned Macs and Batman, an unlikely combination that makes a whole lot of sense in terms of SkyNet’s learning curve in eradicating the human race, especially as I inspect the giant exoskeletons, the retrofitted robotic motorcycles, and the huge bulldozer-esque people “Harvests.”<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/term8.jpg" width="807" height="373" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/term5.jpg" width="807" height="373" style="display:block;float:none;">This is the post-apocalyptic <em>Terminator Salvation</em> world we have to look forward to, one that’s crude and imperfect&mdash;not just unpolished, but smeared in a deep mixture of oil and dirt.</p> <p>“Anybody can flap their lips and say that this is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread,” McG admits. “All I know is that Bale doesn’t fuck around&mdash;he’s already Bruce Wayne, he doesn’t need to be John Connor.”<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/term7.jpg" width="807" height="360" style="display:block;float:none;">That's pretty much all I can say for now, but rest assured you'll hear more from my visit later on.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Rumor Smash: No Zune Phone at CES ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/no-zune-phone-ces2.jpg" width="495" height="428" style="display:block;" />Sorry dudes. Just it first hand from Brian Seitz, Group Manager of Zune: "No Zune phone at CES."</p> <p>Well, at least no Zune Phone as we're hearing it. A few days ago, some analysts stirred up the rumors of a Zune specific piece of hardware this week, complete with hardware details, which Barrons quoted. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5099004/cnbc-zune-phone-is-real-codenamed-pink">CNBC declared that a Zune Phone, called Project Pink</a>, was slated for CES. Mary Jo Foley at ZDNet, who separated the Zune Phone hardware from the Pink project <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1618">weeks ago</a> reminded us that Pink is not a piece of hardware but a platform of services that could allow Zune like services to run on platforms like Windows Mobile. (Although Mary Jo Foley told me today that she thinks that it would be powerful if Pink services ran on other devices, and I agree.) So leave the hardware and Pink apart for a moment. Mary Jo believes Pink could come at CES and with it, a platform for Zune like content on mobile devices, but in line with what Seitz has said on behalf of Microsoft and what Mary Jo Foley believes, I think the Analyst and CNBC have the details slightly skewed.</p> <p>Both CNBC and the analyst <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/12/08/microsoft-to-unveil-zunedanger-device-at-ces-keynote/">Barrons quoted</a> could have been talking to a manufacturer of a phone, describing a specific implementation of Zune like features on a given set of hardware, via Pink components. But coming from a company that builds their best devices in house, I don't think we can call a Zune Phone a Zune Phone until we see actual devices designed in house design by the Entertainment and Devices team. (To me, this stands in contrast with Google and its Android platform, where every implementation of the OS is a Google Phone, since they have no claim to making great hardware.)</p> <p>Based on all this, I reiterate that my best guess is that we have is a good chance of seeing Pink, but not a Zune Phone, at CES 2009. [<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1618">Thanks to Mary Jo Foley for her expertise</a>]</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Giz Explains: Everything You Need to Know About Hard Drives ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/harddrive.jpg" width="807" height="534" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/hardware/Giz_Explains_Everything_You_Need_to_Know_About_Hard_Drives'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>Some say that the end of the trusty hard drive is near, killed by SSD. But let's not be so quick to give up on a technology that stores a whole terabyte for $100.</p> <p>It'll be years before solid-state flash-memory disks (in this case usually referred to as SSDs) let us cheaply bank the same amounts of data as trusty old hard disk drives for a reasonable price. So, you might as well know how they work, 'cause honestly, they'll have a place on or next to your desk holding all the crap that won't fit on daintier solid state drives&mdash;HD movies, huge pictures, music and who knows what else if you're Jason Chen.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/hdhead.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="566" style="display:block;float:none;"><strong>What Goes on Inside</strong><br> The reason hard drive is abbreviated as HDD is that it's really a hard disk drive. Inside you've got <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/hard-disk2.htm">what's called a "platter," which is a magnetized recording surface</a> that spins around really really fast, with a head that zooms across the disk to read and write data, think kinda like a record player, except that the head never actually touches the disk except, as you will see below, when bad things happen. [Image via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hdhead.jpg">Wikipedia</a>]</p> <p>Hard drives also come in a few different sizes, with 1.8", 2.5" and 3.5" being the most common, but they've been bigger (and smaller). 3.5" is for desktops, 2.5" is for notebooks (or obsessively quiet desktops), and 1.8" is what goes in classic iPods, MacBook Airs and other small portable devices.</p> <p>The more platters a drive has, the more data it can hold, but most advances in storage have focused on increasing storage density. A really high-capacity drive <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Seagate-Barracuda-1-5-TB,2032.html">can have four platters</a>, while many 3.5" desktop models and some elite laptop 2.5" drives have three platters. Most laptop drives and all the 1.8" portable-device drives that we know of are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5047611/toshibas-18+inch-120gb-and-240gb-drives-appear-uh-wheres-the-240gb-ipod">limited to two platters</a>.</p> <p>The real catalyst for those 1TB and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5024044/seagates-15+terabyte-barracuda-desktop-hard-drive">1.5TB monster drives</a> pooped out by Hitachi and Seagate wasn't platter stacking, though. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_recording">perpendicular magnetic recording</a>, which allows for triple storage density by storing data vertically (or perpendicularly) along the platter's recording layer, rather than spreading it out across it horizontally (parallel-ly?). However, data is more fragile and susceptible to erasure when stored vertically, hence the slow creep in precision allowing for greater storage densities and capacities.<br> <object width="506" height="417" class="left"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-xPvD0Z9kz8&hl=en&fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-xPvD0Z9kz8&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="506" height="417" class="left"></object><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/-xPvD0Z9kz8_03.jpg" style="display: none;" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail"></p> <p><strong>What All Those Numbers and Letters Mean</strong><br> You might've noticed hard drives are often labeled as IDE or SATA or PATA or PITA (kidding), with specs like 5400RPM or 7200RPM, plus they come in various sizes, like 1.8, 2.5 or 3.5-inches. Confusing, no? So here's all that crap means.</p> <p>RPM means the same thing it does in cars, <strike>rotations</strike> revolutions per minute. In hard drives it's important because the faster the disk spins, the faster it can read and write data. 7200RPM is the standard for desktop drives, but performance models run at <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sas-hard-drives,1702.html">10,000RPM or 15,000RPM</a>. Notebook drives typically run at 5400RPM, because they're smaller, but recently, you can order them with 7200RPM to get more performance at the cost of battery life.</p> <p>A higher RPM is the <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/understanding-hard-drive-performance,1557-3.html">single greatest performance variable</a>, since the faster it spins, the more data it can read or write within whatever time frame&mdash;it also makes access faster, since the head doesn't have to wait as long to pass over the right data once it's moved to the right spot. And a faster (lower) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seek_time">seek time</a>, basically, refers to how long it takes for the drive to move its head where it needs to go to read or write data. High end drives have a seek time of just 2ms, while typical consumer drives are close to 9ms. Also, the higher the buffer&mdash;most typically 8, 16 or 32MB&mdash;the more data it can pre-cache, though Tom's Hardware found that you get<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/understanding-hard-drive-performance,1557-3.html">diminishing returns there</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/hdcables.jpg" class="center" width="807" height="324" style="display:block;float:none;"><strong>How They Connect</strong><br> The various kinds of drives essentially refers to <a href="http://www.geeks.com/techtips/2005/techtips-010605.htm">how it interfaces or connects</a> with your computer's motherboard. There are a bunch, but only a few worth knowing. Up until the last few years, the dominant standard was <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/over.htm">ATA, or Advanced Technology Attachment</a>. Once SATA, or serial ATA, came onto the map (more on that in a sec), regular ATA picked up the alternative name parallel ATA.</p> <p>Further revisions to the ATA spec allowed for hard drives with greater storage and faster transfer speeds, and you might see drives using the later spec revisions called "Ultra ATA" or something similar, and they can transfer data at 133MBps (which is slooooow). ATA drives are commonly called IDE (integrated drive electronics), but ATA is more precise. If you've ever messed around inside a computer, you'd recognize them because they connected to fatass ribbon cables that take up a lot of room. The third major interface, which you should know of, but not necessarily about, is <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/scsi1.htm">SCSI (pronounced "scuzzy")</a>, which was primarily used in the enterprise or high-end space when ATA was still king. The ATA/IDE interface also confused some with its master/slave assignations, which, as you'll see, is no longer a problem.</p> <p>Okay, so the current hard drive standard in consumer PCs as of a few years ago is SATA, which is worlds better than ATA. For one, it's faster&mdash;first-gen devices ran at 1.5Gbps, but now they're up to 3Gbps, and are on the road to hitting 6Gbps. Also, their cables are way thinner, for better air flow and less tangly crap inside your case. And because they're smarter and don't depend on a lot of configuration, they're easy to work with, and are even hot-swappable. Newer external drives use a variant of SATA, eSATA (e for external) that essentially just moves the port to the outside of the computer case, delivering SATA speed for peripherals. Soon, eSATA will come in a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/345524/self+powered-esata-on-the-way-power-bricks-everywhere-shudder-in-fear">bus-powered format</a>, much like the smaller portable USB drives you see today.</p> <p>Fast seek times are different than fast transfer times from a good interface&mdash;one pertains to how quickly the data can be located on the disk, and the other is how fast it can be sent over. To describe it in somewhat oversimplified terms, you can see how a slow interface on a fast seek drive would be better for a system that's constantly shifting tiny bits of data, where a fast interface on a relatively slower drive is good for moving really large files around.</p> <p><object width="506" height="417" class="left"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8hSHBO-yZRg&hl=en&fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8hSHBO-yZRg&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="506" height="417" class="left"></object><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/8hSHBO-yZRg_01.jpg" style="display: none;" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail"><strong>Why They Die</strong><br> Remember how I said the head usually never touches the drive's platter surface? When the head actually does touch the drive platter, it's what's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_crash">called a head crash</a> (check out the video above), and it means you're skee-rewed. Normally the head flies on a tiny pocket of air, but a single particle can make the head bounce on the disk, totally hosing the magnetic layer, especially at higher RPMs. And it just gets worse from there, because stuff scraped away by a head crash making it more likely that more head crashes will happen. More mundanely, the delicate mechanical parts eventually just wear out over time, which is typically measured by the the drive's rated mean time between failures. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot you can do to predict when your drive is gonna go down in flames, unless you bought a drive from a series suffering manufacturing defects.</p> <p>So what is really the single most important thing you should know about hard drives? Back your crap up, they may be awesome, but that doesn't mean they're without weakness.</p> <p><em>Something you still wanna know?

			<title><![CDATA[ Lips Karaoke Game For Xbox 360: Hardware and Media Import Review ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/lips1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="800" height="427" style="display:block;float:none;" />Xbox 360's Lips karaoke game is notable for two reasons. One is the Vegas loungy <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5024505/xbox-360s-lips-karaoke-game-microphone-has-motion-sensing-vegas-lounge-lights">motion-sensitive wireless microphones</a> that trigger bonus scoring opportunities for you as part of the game. The second is the feature that lets you <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5025015/lips-karaoke-confirmed-lets-you-sing-any-song-on-your-zune-or-ipod">use <strong>any</strong> DRM-free song</a> from your iTunes/Zune/Amazon library as a base for singing. So what the hell went wrong?</p> <p>A number of things. Head to <a href="http://kotaku.com/5103940/lips-review-kinda-puckered-up">Kotaku</a> if you want to see how the software side works (or doesn't work), since we're only focusing on the hardware and the media aspects. First, the hardware.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/lips3.jpg" width="800" height="485" class="center"><strong>Hardware</strong>:<br> The two wireless microphones are fairly weighty, nicely balanced and can sense gestures you perform while singing. At least, on paper it can. In our tests we found that vague shakes of the mic can trigger the bonus mode, giving players an alternative to actually have to do fake air guitaring, fake rope lassoing and fake whip cracking.</p> <p>As for actually singing, the three AA-powered microphones are at least as good as Rock Band's and Singstar's versions at picking up audio, if not slightly better. These are also wireless, which is a welcome solution to the problem of tripping over cords in the living room. They're also being <a href="http://kotaku.com/5102909/lips-mic-will-work-with-rock-band-2-eventually">adapted for Rock Band use</a> eventually.</p> <p>But wireless mics with no displays actually make it a pain in the ass to sync up with your Xbox 360. The wordless, diagram-only instructions were little help, telling us to hold down the power button for a second, then pause to turn on the 360's sync button, then hold down the power again for three seconds. We may have been beaten on the head a lot when we were kids, but it shouldn't take us 10-20 tries to get this to sync correctly.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/lips2.jpg" width="800" height="561" class="center"><strong>Media Import</strong>:<br> Here's where Lips really disappoints. The implicit promise of having Lips take in any song from your music library as a track for you to sing and give you a comparable&mdash;if not quite as good&mdash;experience as a pre-packaged track is not just broken, it's shattered. Your own songs will be missing both lyrics and a tone bar, meaning you need to either recite lyrics off a nearby laptop or cull them from your memory. And, you don't know if you're hitting the right note other than your score going higher as you get in the ballpark.</p> <p>There's also no option to import lyrics into your songs, even if you have lyrics embedded inside your MP3. Or timing data, if somehow you knew what Lips supported and rigged that up. There's nothing you can do to salvage the experience. It's the same as playing back an MP3 in iTunes and singing along, except with a halfway decent note detector grading you on how close you are to any noise being reproduced; even the guitar and backing string tracks.</p> <p>The act of importing music isn't much better. For some reason&mdash;and we're guessing it's a memory constraint&mdash;you're limited to only viewing 5356 songs at once from input source. This includes your iPod, your Zune, your shared music over the network, your local hard drive or an optical disc. 5356 songs is quite a lot to actually import into the game, but most people's music collections, let alone their iPods, have more than 5356 songs on it. That means you can only SEE that many songs at once, leaving the rest of your songs hidden and unimportable. Huge oversight. As for the songs it can actually see, Lips takes about 30 seconds per 100 songs, so you're going to be sitting there for a long ass time waiting for your music to show up in the list so you can select it.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong>:<br> All these gripes aren't to say that the game is bad. The actual game itself with the set of 40 packaged songs is polished and fun. But the media import "use your own music" feature, which is one-third assed (not even half-assed) at best, should probably have been left off entirely than shipped in such a tattered state. It's only that this game had so much promise that were so disappointed. We predict that it will be a long time before we actually see a game that delivers on the promise of taking your own purchased content and presents it in a new and entertaining way.

			<title><![CDATA[ Sony Ericsson, HTC to Release Android Phones in 2009 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/android-se2.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="500" height="394" style="display:block;" />It was <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5105406/androids-open-handset-alliance-adds-14-members-sony-ericsson-garmin-asus-and-more">bound to happen</a>, but we never imagined it was going to be so soon. <a href="http://phandroid.com/2008/12/10/sony-ericsson-htc-androids-set-for-summer-2009/">Phandroid says</a> that Sony Ericsson will release their first Android-based telephone <strike>in summer 2009</strike>, according to IDG Sweden. <b>Update:</b> Gustaf Brusewitz has said that no specific timetable has been officially announced yet.</p> <blockquote> <p><strike>We expect to initially focus on higher-end products, but we will also add products for a broader mass market at a later date. The first Android handset will arrive in the summer.</strike></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The development has started, but it’s still early in the process, and we cannot comment on the timing at this stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>That was the official word from Gustaf Brusewitz, an official Sony Ericsson spokesman for Sony Ericsson in Sweden. He also added that they will continue to develop for Symbian and Windows, to get all their bases covered.</p> <p>HTC, the current makers of the G1, will also come with their own Android cellphones in summer 2009. Not only model, but a whole portfolio, according to HTC exec Peter Frølund:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, we will have one or more Android-products by the summer of 2009. I can say that we are working on a portfolio of models.</p> </blockquote> <p>Personally, I can't wait to see what HTC and Sony Ericsson will bring to the table in terms of hardware design and—hopefully—User Interface overhauls.

			<title><![CDATA[ PlayStation Home Launches Everywhere December 11th ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/homebeta2-1.jpg" width="807" height="332" style="display:block;float:none;" />We knew it was on the way, but last we'd heard, PlayStation Home was coming <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5104054/playstation-home-coming-in-9-days">December 17th</a>. Wrong! PS Home will actually launch worldwide <em>tomorrow</em>.</p> <p>Remember, technically PlayStation Home is only an open beta. So if it kinda blows, melts your PS3 or sucks your physical body in to a Tron-like world of horror, it's not Sony's fault. <em>You</em> downloaded it. Oh, and apparently you can buy clothes for your avatar from Diesel. Yes, your fake you will dress better than your real you. Full details:<br></p> <blockquote>PLAYSTATION®HOME BETA SERVICE WILL BECOME AVAILABLE TO ALL PLAYSTATION®3 USERS ON DECEMBER 11<br> Highly Anticipated Service Open For All PLAYSTATION 3 Users <p>Tokyo, Foster City, London, December 10, 2008 – Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCE) today announced that its highly anticipated PlayStation®Home Beta service for PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3™) will become available for all PS3 users around the world *1 on December 11, 2008. Following the successful completion of the closed beta service, PlayStation Home’s open beta service will continue to evolve with new features and functionality.</p> <p>PlayStation Home is a ground-breaking 3D social gaming community available on PS3 that allows users to interact, communicate and share gaming experiences. By leveraging the power of PS3, PlayStation Home delivers overwhelming visual graphics and rich gaming social experiences only possible on the PS3 platform.

			<title><![CDATA[ Ultimate Toy Robot Battlemodo ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/robomodo.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="800" height="542" style="display:block;float:none;" />Everyone wants love, companionship and contact. Those who can't get it from humans can turn to the latest crop of hot toy robots: Wall-E in three sizes, WowWee's Rovio, Femisapien and Mr. Personality, the dino D-Rex, multi-talented Elmo Live and Sony's enchantingly personable Rolly music player. Each exudes a desire to be your loyal friend from every noisy servo and glowing LED. But which should you choose?</p> <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/robomodoon.flv", 475, 376,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/robomodoon.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;">Keep in mind, though two of these list for $400, most cap at $250, and they're <em>all</em> toys. They don't have a heck of a lot of AI, though they do have an impressive array of user-triggered functionality and some goofy "spontaneous" behavior. You ain't getting C-3PO no matter where you turn, not even R2-D2, but there's something cool about each of these:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/mrpersonality300.jpg" width="300" height="371"><strong>Mr. Personality - $245</strong><br> This is one <em>weird</em> bot. Turn it on and it will act like one of the many "personalities" you have downloaded to it, telling jokes, reading fortunes and interacting with you along the way.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> 3-legged, multi-directional wheels move in all directions easily; multiple personalities technically mean relief from boredom; depending on the personality, it'll call you "master"<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> The default personality is very annoying; not enough functions to stay entertaining; obstacle sensors are too sensitive<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Doubtful. Depending on the power of the development community some fun personalities may emerge, but they are severely limited by the options on the remote.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/scaled.rovio494.jpg" width="493" height="505" style="display:block;"><strong>Rovio - $240</strong><br> Maybe the most technical bot of the bunch, the Rovio is a webcam-on-wheels controlled via an internet interface. With some smart maneuvering, you can snoop on your daughter's date in the living room from the privacy of your bedroom. Or, if you have your own domain server, you can control the Rovio from anywhere in the world. It has major limitations, like an awful camera and outside of Internet Explorer you can't hear any sound, but its API allows customization so there's true potential that has yet to be reached.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Good looking, highly interactive UI; like Roomba, can return to its base to charge itself when batteries run low<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Seriously shitty webcam; setting it up on a Mac is torture; if you bought this thinking you can easily control it from anywhere in the world for free you're SOL<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Not yet. The Rovio is a great concept, but you'll be much better off waiting for version 2.0... or maybe 3.0.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/femisapien300.jpg" width="300" height="532"><strong>Femisapien - $50</strong><br> She's the female companion to Robosapien, and she'll blow you kisses, dance to music or speak in her very own gibberish language with you. She doesn't do anything very fancy, but she's the only girl here, so she looks better doing it than most of these other bots.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Fairly interactive; relatively inexpensive; giant robot boobs<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Command system very complicated; routines aren't all that exciting<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Only if your name is <a href="http://gizmodo.com/367698/technosexual-one-mans-tale-of-robot-love">Zoltan</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/2idancewalle400.jpg" width="400" height="412" style="display:block;"><strong>iDance WALL-E - $53</strong><br> The cheapest WALL-E of the crop, and a less expensive alternative to the Rolly, iDance WALL-E dances&mdash;if you can call it that&mdash;to the beat of your MP3 player, or his own built in sound bank. A one-trick pony, but I'll be damned if it isn't an adorable trick.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Look at that little bot&mdash;how could you not love it? His dancing is fun and silly, and he couldn't be any easier to use<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> The speaker sucks; WALL-E's moves don't match the music closely like Rolly's do<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> When we first saw the iDance WALL-E, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5017387/25-idance-wall+e-is-one-seizuriffic-lil-bot">he was only supposed to cost $25 bucks</a>. But now, at twice the price, it's definitely one bot we can live without.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/2ultimatewalle400.jpg" width="400" height="378" style="display:block;"><strong>Ultimate WALL-E - $400</strong><br> The name says it all: The biggest WALL-E of the litter is ultimate in every way. It will follow you around, dance to your music, or perform a pre-programmed series of movements and noises. Best of all, it uses a really interesting controller that can move WALL-E using a touchpad.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Big enough to seem realistic; a ton of features so it won't bore quickly<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive; controller has too many buttons that don't do very much; did I mention "expensive"?<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Who has that kind of money to spend on a robot? Especially one that isn't programmable, upgradable or all that intelligent. It should've stayed at <a href="http://gizmodo.com/386884/wall+e-robot-toy-in-action">its original $190 price</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/2ucommandwalle400.jpg" width="400" height="355" style="display:block;"><strong>U-Command WALL-E - $130</strong><br> U-Command WALL-E is the Baby Bear of the WALL-E bunch, <i>just right</i> in almost every way. Its controls are comparable to the Ultimate WALL-E, it can move, dance and make noises on your command, all for a much more attractive price.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Essentially a "lite" version of the Ultimate WALL-E for less than half the price, versatile controls allow for repeated play without getting too stale<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> The only WALL-E without a line-in speaker for MP3s; not as technically impressive as other over-$100 contenders<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Totally. Even at $130, it's one of the cheaper robots on the list, and the most fun right out of the box.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/rolly400.jpg" width="400" height="265" style="display:block;"><strong>Sony Rolly - $400</strong><br> At first glance, the Rolly doesn't fit the traditional robot mold. The egg-shaped MP3 speaker looks like it's just another smooth white gadget with an "i" in front of its name. But when you see it in action, it's one of the most exciting little toys around, dancing wildly and putting on a light show to the rhythm of the songs coming from its body.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Great speaker; customizes dance/light shows to your own songs; amusing even after repeated viewings<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Can't customize songs on a Mac (but you can on a Vaio!); can't jump to a specific track on the device<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Surprisingly, it might well be. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but I get a huge kick out of the Rolly. The fluidity and snazziness of the movement and lights explains the steep cost.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/DRex494.jpg" width="494" height="370" style="display:block;"><strong>D-Rex - $150</strong><br> The scariest bot of the lot, D-Rex growls, attacks and lets out the sounds of bodily functions from every orifice. Rubbery, lizard-like skin and huge, moving yellow eyes add to the effect.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Creepy; fun to play with (for a while); the coolest looking of all the robots<br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn't do too enough; may scare little kids (or is that a "pro"?)<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Tough call. D-Rex is probably the biggest robot here and isn't that expensive for being so big. But since it only performs a few functions, don't expect anything close to a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pleo-review/playing-with-pleo-the-pet-camarasaurus-verdict-neat-but-pricey-333336.php">Pleo</a>.<br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/elmolive400.jpg" width="400" height="501" style="display:block;"><strong>Elmo Live - $60</strong><br> What's left to say about the newest version of every kid's favorite fuzzy friend? It raps, dances and tells stories and jokes, all in the body of the most popular Muppet of a generation.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5062947/elmo-live-video-review-verdict-buy-if-you-love-your-children">Buy this for your kids and they will love you forever.</a><br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Don't buy this for your kids and they will hate you forever; also, the song "Elmo's Gotta Get On Up" has been stuck in my head for damn near six months<br> <strong>Worth the money?</strong> Do you have a choice? At $60 it's a steal compared to most of these other bots... but good luck finding it.<br clear="all"></p> <p>And now...<br> <strong>The Winner:</strong> U-Command WALL-E. One of the few bots here that is fun to play with more than once, this WALL-E is cute, interactive and kids can enjoy him without driving parents crazy by playing the same thing over and over&mdash;*cough*Elmo Live*cough*.</p> <p><strong>Runner-Up:</strong> Rolly. I can't stop looking at this little dude. His syncopated dancing demands attention from anyone who sees him, and he is the bot that performs his most essential function&mdash;playing music through a speaker&mdash;the best.</p> <p><strong>Honorable Mention:</strong> iDance WALL-E and Ultimate WALL-E. I like you both a lot, but why did you get me all excited with your decent prices, and then double them when I wasn't looking? Not cool guys.</p> <p><strong>The Loser:</strong> Rovio. No offense here Rovio, we really like the though of a remote controlled, customizable webcam and we think you will get it right one day, but right now you cost too much and the most important feature you have&mdash;your webcam&mdash;is absolutely terrible.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Netflix Streaming Battlemodo: TiVo vs. Xbox 360 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/netflixtivo.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="800" height="550" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/gadgets/Netflix_Streaming_Battlemodo_TiVo_vs_Xbox_360'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>Now that Netflix's Watch Instantly is on both <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5103308/netflix-available-on-tivo-now">TiVo</a> and Microsoft's <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5071275/netflix-hd-impressions-on-xbox-360">Xbox 36</a><a href="http://www.mobilecomment.com/">0</a>, the natural question for you, Se&ntilde;or and Se&ntilde;orita tech enthusiast, is which one of these two should YOU use to watch Netflix on. The answer, surprisingly, is whichever one you want. <b>Updated 2:33 PM EST</b></p> <p>Here's how they both compared in video quality, navigation (getting around inside a movie), and general UI experience (queueing up movies to watch).</p> <p>&bull; Video Quality: <b>Tie</b>. We got up to the maximum bars of quality on both TiVo and Xbox 360 for an HD movie, which meant Netflix was streaming the same file content to us on either device. This boiled the visual quality down to each box's respective rendering capability, and it was pretty impossible to tell the difference between the two. The tie means that in terms of quality, you're fine going off with either machine. When watching one of the couple hundred of HD movies on Netflix, you'll get a slightly better than DVD quality experience no matter which one you go with. (Strangely enough, we got one bar down from maximum quality while streaming an SD movie, even though we were able to hit max on an HD one.)</p> <p>&bull; Navigation: <strong>Tie</strong>. <strike>The Xbox 360 still has the problem of not being able to fast forward or rewind, but only jump around in 10(ish) minute increments.</strike> TiVo, on the other hand, CAN fast forward and rewind through the entire movie. There's a lower-resolution video stream that pops up while seeking to show you where you are in the movie, minimizing guesswork as best it can. Unfortunately, only the 7 second skip back feature was implemented to fine-tune your FFing and RWing; the 30 second skip forward forwards you all the way to the end of the movie.</p> <p><b>Update</b> The Xbox 360 actually can fast forward, but not in HD titles (the ones we tested, including <em>The Thing</em>). SD titles seek by way of thumbnailed pictures, slightly different from the way TiVo does it. Thanks to the commenters that pointed this out. They also say that <i>some</i> HD content is able to be FF'ed through.</p> <p>&bull; General UI: <strong>Tie</strong>. You have to add titles from your browser on your computer for both the boxes, since neither one has an on-board Netflix browsing system. The Xbox 360 does have a slightly nicer way of presenting each show, but nothing that should sway you one way or the other.</p> <p>What these ratings mean for you is that you're fine watching Netflix on whichever device you currently have, and shouldn't feel the need to go out and buy the other one. If you've got TiVo and Xbox 360, we'd prefer TiVo's implementation because of the fast forwarding and rewinding feature.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Why You Should Stop Buying Your Computers Fully Loaded ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/Studio17-complete.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="600" height="408" style="display:block;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/hardware/Why_You_Should_Stop_Buying_Your_Computers_Fully_Loaded_2'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>Hard economic times require that we think more closely about how our money is spent. When it comes to computers, Prof. Dealzmodo has a philosophy: build it and values will come.</p> <p>In other words, it makes more financial sense to buy the most basic model at a bargain-basement price and turn it into the top-notch computer of your dreams. It can save you hundreds and maybe even thousands of dollars overall.</p> <p><strong>Laptops:</strong> I visited Dell.com and selected a mid-range laptop&mdash;in this case, the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5019703/dell-studio-notebooks-officially-bring-decent-design-to-mid+range">Studio 17</a>. A model with 2GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive will <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop_studio_17?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs">run you $799</a>&mdash; but what happens when you want to beef it up with some extra RAM and an even bigger hard drive? Just like that, the price shoots up to $1049 for the following configuration (if you stick with Dell hardware upgrades):</p> <blockquote> <p>Dell Studio 17</p> <p>&bull; 2.0GHz Intel Pentium Dual Core T3200<br> &bull; 4GB DDR2 RAM<br> &bull; 640GB (2x320) SATA Hard Drive (5400 RPM)<br> &bull; Integrated graphics</p> </blockquote> <p>However, a quick trip to Newegg to pick up <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134605">RAM</a> and an additional <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822116096">320GB drive</a> brings the total down to $918 for the same computer. Basically, I just shaved $131 off the price by doing these simple upgrades myself.</p> <p>Note: On any system, to make use of all 4GB of RAM, you need 64-bit Windows. You should get it at no extra charge when configuring a system, so be sure to ask up front. Buying an extra copy separately for will cost you <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832116488">a punitive $100</a>.</p> <p>Before you settle on a laptop, make sure that you check to see what can be upgraded and whether or not you can find easily exchangeable parts at a discount. And keep in mind that savings could be increased even further if you start with a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5075525/why-you-should-buy-a-refurbished-laptop">refurbished model</a> or a model that is not loaded with an OS.</p> <p><strong>Desktops:</strong> We all know that desktops, much less custom-built desktops, are not highly sought after these days. Still, the tremendous values here are hard to ignore. PC Gamers are well acquainted with the practice, but I see no reason (outside of the need for portability) why budget shoppers can't take advantage of the savings as well. Once again, I chose a mid-range product from Dell as the control&mdash;the Studio desktop.</p> <p><strong>Example #1 (A Studio configuration straight from the <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/desktop-studio-mini?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&~ck=mn&ST=dell%20studio%20desktop&dgc=ST&cid=35215&lid=885189">Dell website</a>):</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>&bull;2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E7300<br> &bull; 24" Widescreen HD LCD<br> &bull; 4GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM<br> &bull; 1TB Serial ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM)<br> &bull; ATI Radeon HD 3650 256MB GPU<br> &bull; 16X DVD+/-RW Drive<br> &bull; Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio<br> &bull; Vista Home Premium</p> <p>Total Cost: $1464</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Example #2 (A Studio configuration with custom-installed parts):</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Base model<br> &bull; 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E7300<br> &bull; No monitor<br> &bull; 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM<br> &bull; 500GB Serial ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM)<br> &bull; Integrated graphics<br> &bull; 16X DVD+/-RW Drive<br> &bull; Integrated Audio<br> &bull; Windows Vista Premium</p> <p>Add custom parts:<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231203">4GB DDR2 SDRAM</a> for $40<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236049">24" Asus Widescreen HD LCD</a> for $300<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148274">1TB Seagate Serial ATA Hard Drive</a> (7200RPM) for $110<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127375">Radeon HD 3650 256MB GPU</a> for $55<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829102027">Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio</a> for $50</p> <p>Total Cost of Base Model: $749<br> Upgrades: $555<br> Total Cost Overall: $1304</p> </blockquote> <p>As with the laptop, by simply upgrading components myself I managed to save cash&mdash;in this case, $160&mdash;and I have an extra 500GB drive to boot.</p> <p><strong>Example #3 (Total custom build):</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>&bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119159">Cooler Master Case with 460W Power Supply</a> for $90<br> &bull; 24" Asus Widescreen HD LCD for $300<br> &bull; 1TB Seagate Serial ATA Hard Drive for $110<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106263">Lite-On 20x DVD+/-RW Drive</a> for $21<br> &bull; Radeon HD 3650 256MB GPU for $55<br> &bull; Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio for $50<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823164003">Basic keyboard</a> for $5<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826193024">Basic mouse</a> for $5<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227199">4GB DDR2 SDRAM</a> for $42<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130217">Motherboard</a> for $45<br> &bull; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115132">2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E7300</a> for $120<br> &bull; Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit for $100</p> <p>Total Cost of Build: $943</p> </blockquote> <p>By building from scratch, I was able put together the same computer (in terms of performance) as the Dell Studio in the first example for $521 less&mdash;and the majority of the components are better. I also saved an extra $361 over the upgrade to the base Studio model in example #2.</p> <p>It is also important to note that making upgrades on laptops and factory desktops can void your warranty. This may be something you want to check on before proceeding. You may also want to investigate local businesses that specialize in custom builds if you lack the skills necessary to make the upgrades yourself. Even though these services are an added expense, you are still likely to come out on top.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The bottom line is that saving money on a computer is more than just finding the best deal online. In this case, it's kind of like buying a fixer-upper. When you walk into the property the realtor tries to help you focus on what the home <em>could be</em> as opposed to what it currently is. Again, before you buy, make sure to check and see if doing some of the upgrades yourself can help you save some extra money. In order to maintain continuity and keep things simple, I stuck with Dell and Newegg here&mdash;but, obviously, branching out could lead to greater savings. You could also save a lot more if you are willing to make a sacrifice or two here and there&mdash;like going with AMD over Intel (although I doubt many Intel fans would be willing to make that jump no matter what the cost).</p> <p><em>Prof. Dealzmodo is a regular section dedicated to helping budget-minded consumers learn how to shop smarter and get the best deals on their favorite gadgets.

			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblu1.jpg" width="807" height="318" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/movies/Review_The_Dark_Knight_Blu_ray_Disc'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>I don't claim to think that I can in any way influence your purchase of <em>The Dark Knight</em> on Blu-ray ($24) or DVD ($15/$21). In fact, I don't really want to. I couldn't care less if you buy it, rent it or stomp any loose copies you spot at the store.</p> <p>But to me, the 3-disc Blu-ray set (2 discs of content and an extra disc for the digital copy) has brought an unparalleled experience to my home theater. And I'm going to fanboy out a bit for 30,000 or so words.</p> <p><strong>The Movie</strong><br> In one respect, a 1080p display could never hope to capture the multi-story IMAX experience. And it doesn't. But seeing the first shot of the movie, that of a less recognizable Chicago skyline, rekindled what it was like to sit in the theater and see film as I'd never quite seen it before. It was also the prettiest high definition moment I've experienced yet.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblunew4.jpg" width="807" height="448" style="display:block;float:none;">Just as in its theatrical release, the IMAX footage plays at a different resolution. It fills an HDTV in 1.78:1 aspect while the rest of the movie plays back with black bars in 2.4:1. And just as in its theatrical release, the transition is barely noticeable.</p> <p>But despite all of this video glory, I've never felt so torn over a DVD release. On one hand, <em>The Dark Knight</em> is a technical masterpiece&mdash;sharp, colorful, vivid and pretty much any other advertisement-inspired words you could imagine. On the other, its inability to be contained on a 40-inch LCD reminds me of why we will always need theaters. A big movie simply cannot be captured on the small screen scale, even though it's a lot of fun to watch <em>The Dark Knight</em> try.</p> <p><strong>The Extras</strong><br> As for the extras, I was shocked to find no commentary by director Christopher Nolan. It's rare that I actually watch those things, as much as they've successfully tipped the scales on me making many a DVD purchases. But I wanted to hear Nolan's unscripted reminiscences of filming in Chicago, flipping trucks and blowing up cars on the streets of my hometown.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblunew3.jpg" width="807" height="428" style="display:block;float:none;">What we get instead is about an hour of featurettes that can be called up during relevant parts of the movie or just played from the main menu. While I was initially pretty bummed about the unworthy substitution, I will say that these short documentaries were lovingly assembled, providing incredibly detailed accounts of pulling off a chase sequence on shady Lower Whacker Drive with only ambient lighting, and loading an IMAX camera onto a steadicam rig...only to snap the metal suspension bar under the camera's weight.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblunew1.jpg" width="807" height="453" style="display:block;float:none;">I hadn't realized that the film used minatures for some of the great Batmobile sequence, which was entertaining in the most childish-fulfilling way. But maybe even more impressive was when the crew submitted to the impossibility of shooting Batman's base jumping scene over Hong Kong. They used a stunt double on a green screen instead&mdash;a stunt double that still dropped 120 real feet in a studio.</p> <p>There are countless little bits of trivia like these along with lots of behind the scenes footage (all shot with decent HD cameras, btw). From the Batpod to all of Batman's tiny gadgets, we get access to it all in this fantastic hour of features.</p> <p>That's disc one.</p> <p>Disc two contains is technically the one containing all the extras, but honestly, it's the first disc that's more impressive. There are two History Channelesque documentaries (one on Batman's gadgets and the other on Batman's psyche). Both are extremely professionally assembled, and they tend to explore the Batman from comic books as much as the Batman from recent films. I enjoyed watching the CIA discuss Batman's utility belt from 1960s comics and getting a look at how we build bulletproof ceramics in real life.</p> <p>But the rest of the features disc is filled with about an hour's worth of faux newsreels known as Gotham Tonight. It's bad internet content that's filling up room on the back of The Dark Knight box. And it's just awkward to watch b-list talk about Batman sightings and Gotham politics, frankly.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblu2.jpg" width="807" height="525" style="display:block;float:none;">There's also a notable series of slideshows, but the pictures should really go full screen.</p> <p><strong>The BD Live</strong><br> As for BD-Live content, you've got to remember that this is Warner Bros' first BD Live enabled disc, and it actually offers something really, really promising with the platform. You can record your own commentary track. The only catch is that you actually do the recording through Warner Bros' site while you watch the film streamed (before you later download it to your Blu-ray player). But it's a neat idea for BD Live and it will be interesting to see what the fan base does with it. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the website working yet.<br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblu4.jpg" width="807" height="628" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/batmanblu3.jpg" width="807" height="476" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <strong>The Heroic Ending</strong><br> Like I said, it's more than a bit futile to review <em>The Dark Knight</em> on Blu-ray. It's almost a sure thing to outsell its predecessors. The most popular movie of the decade will certainly be the best selling BD of the last handful of lackluster years.</p> <p>But I do think that Warner Bros. did the material justice, even if the discs have a bit of worthless filler. The film is, of course, excellent. And the extras that are worthwhile <em>really are</em> worthwhile, representing the upper echelon of behind the scenes film content.</p> <p>If I had one complaint, it's that Nolan and Bale clearly didn't have contracts that were binding enough to force them to sit in the same room for two and a half hours, making awkward, human small talk over a film that's grown so legendary in its reputation and lore.</p> <p><em>One thing we meant to mention: The BD and premium DVD versions of the film also include a free VOD copy of the movie along with the digital version if purchased from Amazon.</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ FYI: Blending a Charged iPhone Causes Explosions ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/blendiphone_02.jpg" width="494" height="370" style="display:block;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/apple/Will_it_blend_iPhone_20'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>On Saturday at the Gizmodo Gallery, we blended a fully-functioning iPhone with a Blendtec, sacrificing it to the gods of copy and paste. What we learned was that if you blend an iPhone with its battery inside, it explodes. Whoops!</p> <p><script type="text/javascript"> newVideoPlayer("/blendiphone.flv", 506, 423,""); </script><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/stills/blendiphone.flv.jpg" style="display:block;display: none;">Yeah, so we probably should have taken the battery out, but we wanted to show that it worked when we blended it (the iPhone was Blam's first generation model). Of course, I was the idiot chosen to do the blending, but luckily I was wearing a lab coat, which caught most of the battery acid milkshake. The same can't be said for Brian, who caught a lot of it on the face, but luckily none in his eyes.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"> galleryPost('blendiphone', 12, ''); </script>So yeah, we stopped the blending session after that, because it scared the everloving crap out of me. It's better to leave these sorts of things to the professionals, it turns out.</p> ]]></description>

MOVIES AND TV EPISODES<br> FROM NETFLIX DIRECTLY TO THE TV THROUGH TIVO DVRs AVAILABLE TODAY</p> <p>Just in Time for the Holidays, Offering Brings Budget Conscious Entertainment to Consumers</p> <p>ALVISO, Calif. - December 8, 2008 — After announcing a groundbreaking partnership in October with Netflix Inc., TiVo Inc. (NASDAQ: TIVO), the creator of and a leader in television services for digital video recorders (DVRs), today announced that subscribers to both Netflix and TiVo® Series3, TiVo HD, or TiVo HD XL can now access thousands of movies and TV episodes instantly streamed from Netflix directly to their TVs.</p> <p>The service is being offered at no additional charge to customers who subscribe to both services. This morning subscribers can browse through an expanding library of more than 12,000 movies and TV episodes at www.netflix.com, add them to their Netflix instant Queue, and then watch them on TV with just a click of the TiVo remote. The library includes titles from every genre, with a modest selection of HD content available as well. Both standard and HD titles are expected to grow in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <p>“With so much talk focusing on the economy these days, this partnership makes more sense than ever because it brings people more movies at home, offering substantially more entertainment options than cable or satellite," said Tara Maitra, GM and Vice President of Content Services at TiVo Inc. “TiVo offers consumers everything they need from just one box.

			<title><![CDATA[ Today at Giz Gallery: Mars in 3D, Deathmatch For Charity, Closing ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/gizmodo-gallery-yoyo_01.JPG" width="494" height="328" style="display:block;" />Today is already the last day of the Gizmodo Gallery, and we've got a few special things happening before we close up shop today at 4PM and send all the gear back to its makers.</p> <p>&bull; More showings of NASA's Mars Rover images, for the first time in 3D. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5103595/at-giz-gallery-mars-in-3d-on-our-giant-tv">And to Bowie</a>!<br> &bull; More <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5103167/beat-gizmodos-call-of-duty-fanatics-make-them-frown-win-a-prize">Deathmatch for Charity</a>.<br> &bull; Raffle prize collection starts near the end of the day, so check your emails if you donated earlier in the week or earlier today.

But you're probably more sorry! After the free liquor-fueled party at The Annex, we retreated back to the Gallery after hours for pizza, beer and Call of Duty 4 on the 103-inch Panasonic plasma.

			<title><![CDATA[ Virtual Visit to the Gizmodo Gallery ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/gizmodogalleryvr.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="646" height="296" style="display:block;float:none;" />Jesus H Christ. The Gizmodo Gallery is kicking ass, as my hangover from yesterday's party demonstrates. For those of you who can't come, <a href="http://luminous-newyork.com/">German photographer Joergen Geerds</a> has done a ultra-high definition virtual reality panorama. Check it out:</p> <p><iframe width="800" height="369" frameborder="0" id="gizmodo" name="gizmodo" src="http://newyorkpanorama.com/clients/gizmodo/2008-12-Gizmodo-Gallery.html"></iframe></p> <p>You can zoom in using the shift key in your keyboard (or your mouse zoom button). The level of detail is amazing, and the VR execution absolutely flawless. If you want to see more of his work—or perhaps commission some job—visit <a href="http://newyorkpanorama.com/">New York Panorama</a>. And don't forget to check his <a href="http://luminous-newyork.com/">his photos of NYC at night</a>. Gorgeous.</p> ]]></description>

(Uh, if anyone got photos of any of last night's debauchery, could you email them to me? I forgot to take photos.) Chris and I are just finishing sweeping the floors and we're ready to have more guests look at our wonderful and weird collection of gadgets. It's all to help buy Toys for Tots. If you're in NYC, you have to come down. If not to see the big TV and say hello, then at least to see our special events that are happening today and today only.</p> <p>Watch Matt and Adam face all comers in our Deathmatch for Charity happening at 1PM until they give up, and at 3PM, we'll do a live Will it Blend demo using our computer controlled Blendtec blender. While they haven't sanctioned this public showing of their fantastic shredder at work, I think if you bring some gadgets to destroy, I'll consider it.</p> <p>Watch the proceedings&mdash;during daytime hours&mdash;on the live Justin.tv feed:<br> <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="263" width="320" id="jtv_player_flash" data="http://www.justin.tv/widgets/jtv_player.swf?channel=gizmodo" bgcolor="#000000"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.justin.tv/widgets/jtv_player.swf"> <param name="flashvars" value="channel=gizmodo&auto_play=false&start_volume=25"></object></p> <p>[Thanks to <a href="http://www.thereedspace.com/">REED ANNEX</a> and thanks to our benefactor <a href="http://www.gizmine.com/">gizmine.com</a>]</p> <p><b>Gizmodo Gallery</b><br> <br> <a href="http://www.thereedspace.com/">Reed Annex</a><br> <br> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=151+orchard+street+ny&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ll=40.721226,-73.989122&spn=0.009741,0.015814&z=16&g=151+orchard+street+ny&iwloc=addr">151 Orchard Street</a><br> <br> New York, NY 10002</p> <p>Gallery Dates:<br> <br> December 4th-7th</p> <p>Times:<br> <br> 12/4 Thursday<br> <br> 12-8</p> <p>12/5 Friday<br> <br> 12-8</p> <p>12/6 Saturday<br> <br> 11-8</p> <p>12/7 Sunday<br> <br> 11-4</p> <p>[Read more about our <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5082811/gizmodo-gallery-our-wonderful-world-of-gadgets-on-display-in-nyc">Gizmodo Gallery here</a> and see what else we'll be <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/Gizmodo%20Gallery">playing with</a> at the event.]</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Gallery Today: DeLorean, Meetup, Free Shirts, Deathmatch ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/delorean-beer-tshirt.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="572" height="428" style="display:block;" />Hey, the Gizmodo Gallery is open again, and we've got some fun stuff happening today and <em>only today</em>, including a reader meetup with <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/exclusive/gizmodo-limited+edition-iphone-launch-t+shirts-272864.php">free t-shirts</a> and cheap beer. And a DeLorean.</p> <p>&bull; The DeLorean, with full <em>Back to the Future</em> rigging, will be here at 5pm, parked in front of the Gallery. Maybe we can arrange for rides?</p> <p>&bull; <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5099673/at-giz-gallery-reader-meetup-with-a-back-to-the-future-delorean">The reader meetup is happening tonight</a>. The Gallery will be closed to the public at 8, but if you're a reader, knock on the REED ANNEX door and say the password ("password") for a private viewing until the drinks across the street happen at 9. We'll also be giving away a few iPhone t-shirts that Jesús designed for the original iPhone launch, and in the bar across the street (The Annex, not to be confused with REED Annex) beers will be $4, which I'm told is some kind of freaking discounted price in NYC. Got that? Full details for location below.</p> <p>&bull; Matt Buchanan and Adam Frucci have told me they think they can take on ANYONE in Call of Duty. And if you come in and beat them between 4PM-5:30pm, I've got some prizes for you from our giant stash.</p> <p>Of course, we also have all the gallery items we've run before, plus some newly arrived <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/bug%20labs">Bug Labs</a> gadgets and a 20th Anniversary Mac which we're giving away&mdash;more later on that.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Dealzmodo Hack: Make Your Old USB Stick Into a Digital Multitool ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/usbtop.jpg" width="807" height="497" style="display:block;float:none;" />With 8GB flash drives available for under $20 and 32GB drives edging into the mainstream, nobody can blame you for shelving old USB sticks. But there are a surprising number of uses for those rickety, sub-gigabyte keychains.</p> <p>There are nearly endless ways to bring a USB stick out of retirement, and they're not just gimmicks: virtually all USB sticks, 32MB USB 1.1 dinosaurs included, can be repurposed into anything from a lifesaving troubleshooting tool to an entire portable OS. Here are your best options:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/bitlocker_01.jpg" width="150" height="137"><strong>Turn it into a physical "key" for your computer</strong><br> For security freaks or the extraordinarily literal-minded, Vista has built-in software to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/vista/windows-vista-tip-enable-bitlocker-with-a-usb-drive-234459.php">convert your USB key into an actual key</a>, such that your PC won't boot without having it inserted. It might not be ideal if your key may be old enough that it is likely to fail on you, if you have a propensity to lose tiny things, or if your laptop only has one or two USB ports to begin with, but it definitely offers a special kind of peace of mind. For Macs, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5037637/rohos-logon-key-converts-any-usb-stick-to-a-mac-login-key">Rohos essentially does the same thing</a>, but at $30, it's not particularly recession-friendly.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/linux_01.jpg" width="150" height="181"><strong>Install a portable OS</strong><br> This is actually simpler and less esoteric than it sounds&mdash;installing a wide array of Linux systems is pretty easy nowadays, and will more importantly net you a fully functional desktop that you can take with you wherever you go. Lifehacker recently assembled a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5069054/battle-of-the-thumb-drive-linux-systems">useful comparison</a> of popular USB-able Linux distributions, in which they recommend the fantastic <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">UNetbootin</a> or creating the bootable keys in the first place. It's worth noting that two of these distros will work on keys at less than 128MB capacity (DSL is just 50MB, total) and all carry a legitimately useful range of apps.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/portapps_01.jpg" width="150" height="148"><strong>Use portable apps to create a pocketable user profile</strong><br> Most free software now comes in a portable variety, meaning that at least under Windows, programs that normally extend their tentacles into your user profile and registry can be installed completely&mdash;user data included&mdash;onto a USB stick. All you do is insert the stick and find the desired .exe, and you're good to go.</p> <p>The most obvious advantage to this is profile portability&mdash;in other words, your portable <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Firefox</a> (or <a href="http://www.opera-usb.com/operausben.htm">Opera</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5045439/portable-chrome-puts-chrome-on-your-thumb-drive">Chrome</a>) isn't just the app, it's your favorites, history, user preferences and cookies too. The <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/pidgin_portable">portable version of Pidgin</a>, a multiprotocol IM program, can hold your account data, transcripts and settings. Most of these installations are quite small&mdash;Firefox is just 8MB, for example&mdash;so you can build an extensive user profile on all but the oldest keys.</p> <p>The very best one-stop shop for portable apps is the, well, aptly named <a href="http://portableapps.com/suite">PortableApps.com</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/ubcd_01.jpg" width="150" height="112"><strong>Create a powerful troubleshooting toolbelt</strong><br> Portable <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/clamwin_portable">antivirus</a> and file <a href="http://www.recuva.com/">recovery apps</a> are convenient, but a USB key can be loaded up with much more powerful software. <a href="http://www.ubcd4win.com/index.htm">Ultimate Boot CD for Windows</a> is a sort of software panacea which, in addition to including a selection of Windows maintenance apps, carries a veritable treasure trove of low-level troubleshooting programs, made accessible by booting into a sort of temporary "Windows Lite" desktop. It can manage disk deletion and partitioning, software and hardware diagnostics and a huge variety of lifesaving recovery functions. Despite the "CD" part of its name, Ultimate Boot CD for Windows can be loaded onto a USB key, though it requires a Windows installation disc from which to build the aforementioned "Windows Lite" environment. If you don't run Windows but still want a basic DOS-based suite of hardware diagnostics and disk tools, the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">vanilla Ultimate Boot CD</a> has you <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2006/03/25/install-and-boot-ultimate-boot-cd-ubcd-from-a-usb-device/">covered</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/emu_01.jpg" width="150" height="131"><strong>Convert it into a tiny SNES, Genesis, MAME, etc.</strong><br> Emulators are tiny, and most ROMs are even tinier; a USB key, no matter the size or speed, can probably hold more vintage console games than you can find the time to play. Many popular emulators come in a portable flavor, so your display settings, saved games and cheats will follow you everywhere. Without the need to install anything, this potentially opens up work, school or other public PCs to most pre-PlayStation gaming. Popular portable <a href="http://fceultra.sourceforge.net/">NES</a>, <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/">SNES</a>, <a href="http://boycottadvance.emuunlim.com/Downloads.htm">Game Boy</a>, <a href="http://www.gens.ws/downloads.shtml">Genesis</a>, and <a href="http://mameui.classicgaming.gamespy.com/">arcade</a> emulators. As for ROMs, that's on you. (Pro tip: GOOGLE).</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/vnc_01.jpg" width="150" height="150"><strong>Carry a portal to your home computer</strong><br> Virtual Network Computing (VNC) sounds more complicated than it is&mdash;it simply lets you see and control your computer screen remotely. Whatever OS you run (<a href="http://www.uvnc.com/install/installation.html">Windows</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxvnc/">Mac OS X</a>, <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/download.html">Linux</a>), VNC servers are simple to set up and, if configured correctly, plenty secure. While many provide web interfaces to be accessed through a browser, they're almost always clunky, Java-based monstrosities. A simple <a href="http://www.uvnc.com/download/index.html">VNC client</a> (download the binary archive version) will carry your settings, run responsively and offer more quality, speed and transfer options than its bastard HTTP brother, transporting a home computer's desktop to wherever you happen to be.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/charity_01.jpg" width="150" height="112"><strong>Donate it to charity</strong><br> If you're some kind of ingrate who doesn't see the potential in any of the above options (or you're just a good, charitable person), <a href="http://www.inveneo.org/">InVineo</a>, a non-profit tech outreach organization will find someone who does. They'll <a href="http://www.inveneo.org/?q=Thumbdrive">gladly take</a> your 64MB Cruzers and send them to developing countries to be used in schools or local governments.</p> <p>Hat tip to <a href="http://Lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> and <a href="http://portableapps.com">Portable Apps</a>.</p> <p><em><a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/dealzmodo-hacks">Dealzmodo Hacks</a> are intended to help you sustain your <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5059598/zero+cost-gadget-upgrades-for-the-next-great-depression">crippling gadget addiction through tighter times</a>.

The Gizmodo Gallery has been a huge success so far, especially with <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/">Phil Torrone</a> from Make doing free laser etchings all day for anyone who brought him a graphic and a gadget to tattoo. But setup, well, it took awhile. </p> <p>Especially deciding where to put what furniture, and what gadgets to put on what particular pieces of furniture. We ended in a mental loop for a few hours, trying to sort everything out so it would be presented perfectly, and in the end, we were satisfied. But from start to finish, it took us 15 hours to do. Which we compressed into a 45 second time lapse video which you can see above.</p> <p>[Thanks to <a href="http://www.thereedspace.com/">REED ANNEX</a> and thanks to our benefactor <a href="http://www.gizmine.com/">gizmine.com</a>]</p> <p><b>Gizmodo Gallery</b><br /><br /> <a href="http://www.thereedspace.com/">Reed Annex</a><br /><br /> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=151+orchard+street+ny&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ll=40.721226,-73.989122&spn=0.009741,0.015814&z=16&g=151+orchard+street+ny&iwloc=addr">151 Orchard Street</a><br /><br /> New York, NY 10002</p> <p><strong>Gizmodo Gallery Reader Meetup</strong><br /><br /> The <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5099673/at-giz-gallery-reader-meetup-with-a-back-to-the-future-delorean">reader meetup</a> takes place across the street from the Gallery, at a place called <a href="http://www.theannexnyc.com/">The Annex</a> (not to be confused with REED ANNEX where the gallery is hosted.)

			<title><![CDATA[ Computer Assisted Memory: Brilliant or Horrific? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/11/mouse_x220.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2"/>I'm no memory or brain expert, only barely having the necessary equipment, but this <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/01/woman-has-perfect-ep.html">perfect episodic memory</a> post on BoingBoing got me thinking about memory and how technology will alter it in the future.</p> <p>To summarize, Jill Price, 42, can remember everything from the year 1980 on. This is fine if she wants to remember exactly when and where O.J. Simpson was arrested, but <i>horrible</i> if she wants to forget an embarrassing situation, a loved one dying or any slights anyone has ever caused her. In Price's case, she's actually not that great at all types of memory recollection, but can remember exactly how she felt during certain instances.</p> <p>The researcher who studied her case and subjected her to five years' worth of tests, says that it's actually a part of our brain's design that we have to forget things. If there are too many connections, "the brain would be hopelessly overburdened and would operate more slowly." (<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,591972,00.html">Full article here</a>)</p> <p>But in the next 50-some years, super memory may not be relegated to just the realm of individuals with specific genetic quirks, but belong to <i>everyone</i> by way of computer assisted memory. <a href="http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200518/000020051805A0661216.php">Here's one of several research projects dedicated to the topic</a>. Here's a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3D9173FF933A15755C0A9649C8B63">NYT</a> article talking about replacing living neurons with silicon ones. It's all very far in the future, but would you want it if you could?</p> <p><strong>No</strong>: If all it meant was an increase in what we currently have; meaning, the ability to make more memories like Jill Price but no further ability to control it. Not to get too existential, but what would you do if you couldn't forget <i>anything</i>? You'd be like Leonard in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>, reliving your wife's death every time anything reminded you of her. You'd alienate yourself from not being able to forgive others' indiscretions. No thank you.</p> <p><strong>Yes</strong>: If the technology gave you <i>extra</i> abilities to control your memory. You could access anything you wanted from the past&mdash;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5101998/mamoru+kun-finds-misplaced-glasses-and-slippers-i-no-longer-fear-getting-old">where your keys are, for example</a>&mdash;but control what you wanted to remember. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5067451/forget-for-good-chemicals-could-permanently-erase-memories-one-day">There's already a chemical found to erase long-term or targeted memories</a>. Had a bad day at the office? Block it off, or at least block off the emotions that are attached to it. Had a family member pass away? Technologically put some distance between you and the event, letting mental scars heal faster. This option introduces many other implications that are more philosophical than we should get into here, but as we're doing more and more body modifications in the future, it's something we'll all have to think about.</p> <p>What do you think? Which would you choose?

			<title><![CDATA[ Lightning Review: New Apple In-Ear Headphones ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/headphones_8.jpg" width="800" height="490" style="display:block;float:none;" /><strong>The Gadget:</strong> Not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-In%252dEar-Headphones-%252d-M9394G%252fC/dp/B000VRU4JE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1228421805&sr=8-1">original In-Ear Headphones</a>, Apple's <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5047355/new-apple-premium-in+ear-headphones-with-dual-drivers-only-79">new In-Ear Headphones</a> have been redesigned from the ground up with balanced audio powered by two drivers in each ear. It also comes with a remote and microphone that's compatible with the iPod Nano 4G, iPod touch 2G, iPod Classic and iPhone 3G (kinda).<br> <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"> galleryPost('inearapple', 3, ''); </script></p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> $80</p> <p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> After a history of offering lackluster earbuds, Apple has come through with a product that sounds really good and is reasonably priced, all things considered. The balanced sound and dual drivers makes all the difference in the quality factor. While not necessarily thumpy, the bass has a nice resonance without drowning out many of the high end intricacies found in jazz or electronic music. The midrange audio is relatively flat and doesn't overpower your ears, which is nice because it allows the high end noises to really stand out, letting you hear things you don't get from your car or computer speakers.</p> <p>To see how they stacked up in the headphone scheme of things, I tested them against a pair of standard iPod headphones, the premium Zune headphones, and the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/shure-nuf/shure-busts-out-99-se110-earphones-secretly-makes-them-iphone-friendly-295572.php">Shure SE110s</a>, the winner of our <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5033455/ultimate-cut+the+crap-in+ear-headphone-battlemodo">earphone battlemodo</a>.</p> <p>&bull; Unsurprisingly, the Apple In-Ears outclassed the normal iPod earphones in every category, providing superior sound and comfort.</p> <p>&bull; The Zune Premium Headphones v2, which are very good for only costing $30-$40, had bass that was a bit punchier, but could not compete against the mids and highs of the Apple In-Ears. If you really like bass or a lower price, you might favor the Zune headphones, which more than get the job done. But on sound quality alone, the Apple In-Ear headphones are superior.</p> <p>&bull; Compared to the Shure SE110s, the Apple In-Ear headphones don't quite match up. It's not a stark difference between the two, but the SE110s are superior in almost every category, from bass, to high end clarity. Part of that is because the Apple In-Ears don't have the noise isolation capability, and partly because they're just not quite as good. And though theyre $40 cheaper than the SE110s MSRP, you can find the SE110s at some online outlets as low as $75.</p> <p>As far as remote capabilities go, I tested the Apple In-ear headphones with an iPhone 3G and a first gen iPod touch (neither of which are officially supported. As Apple claims, the audio works fine with both devices. Neither the remote or the mic work with the iPod touch 1G at all, merely reducing it to a pair of headphones. On the iPhone 3G, you can't use the volume. You can still play/pause a song, answer/end a call, change tracks and make use of the microphone. But all of those work perfectly fine on the iPhone.</p> <p>Overall, the Apple In-Ear Headphones are a quality product at a fairly reasonable price. They sound great, and work as expected. That said, unless you really need a remote on your headphones (or just want to show the world you're a card-carrying member of the Cult of Apple), there are still a couple of better values out there. Still, Apple's latest headphone offering is not a bad choice. [<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/inearheadphones/">Apple</a>]</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ The Ultimate $250 Camera Shoot-Out ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/psshootout.jpg" width="807" height="415" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/gadgets/The_Ultimate_250_Camera_Shoot_Out'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>There are a lot of $200-$300 point and shoots on the market right now, and there's no way the test display at Best Buy is going to tell you which to buy. How is elbowing other shoppers while analyzing your hasty snapshots on a 3-inch, low-rez screen going to help you make an informed buying decision?</p> <p>Instead, I put six of the most popular point-and-shoots on the market through some major testing. Then I decided on the one that you should buy without the hedging BS.</p> <p><strong>Meet our competitors</strong><br> <br> <em>Each of these compact point and shoots features optical image stabilization and is priced around $250:</em></p> <p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=camerascamcorders&type=digitalcameras&subtype=tlseries&model_cd=EC-TL9ZZBBA/US">Samsung TL9 ($280)</a><br> <br> 10MP, 5X zoom, 2.7-inch LCD</p> <p><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=145&modelid=16718#ModelDetailAct">Canon SD790 ($250)</a><br> <br> 10MP, 3X zoom, 3-inch LCD</p> <p><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-Camera/26120/COOLPIX-S560.html">Nikon S560 ($250)</a><br> <br> 10MP, 5X zoom, 2.7-inch LCD</p> <p><a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665309170">Sony W170 ($250)</a><br> <br> 10MP, 5x zoom, 2.7-inch LCD</p> <p><a href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/shop/Cameras-Camcorders/Digital-Cameras/Lumix-Digital-Cameras/model.DMC-FS20K_11002_7000000000000005702">Panasonic FS20 ($250)</a><br> <br> 10MP, 4x zoom, 3-inch LCD</p> <p><a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=13044&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=7962">Kodak M1093 ($200)</a><br> <br> 10MP, 3x zoom, 3-inch LCD</p> <p><strong>Studio Shoot</strong><br> <br> The shots inside were captured under diffused sunlight in full auto mode at max (10MP) resolution. I won't say that it wasn't an extreme disappointment that only one camera, the Kodak, was able to shoot with proper white balance in this situation and offer us colors as they really look (you'll have to trust me on this one). The other cameras compensated poorly, possibly metering the diffused light as tungsten light, and producing a fairly cold image because of it.<br> <br> <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"> galleryPost('camerabattlemodo', 6,''); </script><br> <br> Other than the color, you can't make out much from the wide shots. But if you blow the images up to their native resolution, there are huge differences. Even in the web-compressed images here, it's obvious that Canon captures the most detail:<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/canoncookies2compressed.jpg" width="807" height="440" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>It's basically a tie between Sony and Kodak for second place. Here's what Kodak looks like:<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/kodakcookie2compressed.jpg" width="807" height="466" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>And then there's a pretty hard drop in quality. Panasonic comes in a solid last place here:<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/panasoniccookie2compressed.jpg" width="807" height="384" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>You can fix the color by manually choosing a smarter white balance (color temperature), or adjusting the balance in post. But you can't get the texture of those cookies back. Big win for Canon here.</p> <p><strong>Motion Photography</strong><br> <br> It's no secret that many point-and-shoots are horrible for capturing the spontaneity of a child or pet, in part due to focus lag and often an additional wait before the shot is actually taken. While DSLRs are the best solution, I wanted to see if any point-and-shoots could rise to the challenge of capturing some action.</p> <p>So I put them to the test on a Chicago side street where cars get up to 15-20mph. After repeat testing on each model, once again, we had a clear winner. Trouble is, it's Panasonic, loser of the resolution match! Panasonic features more shooting settings than any of its competitors, so my guess is that they spent a lot of time on optimizing at least this particular preset optimization.<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/panasonicmotion.jpg" width="807" height="518" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <br> The remainder of the competition was fairly close, and I can't say that even the Panasonic model will capture any incredible sports action photography. But I will say that the Nikon and Samsung seemed to lag more than the others from button press to shot acquisition. They both tended to have the blurriest shots as well. Here's a typical result of the Nikon:<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/nikonmotion2.jpg" width="807" height="556" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p><strong>Video</strong><br> <br> Like high-speed photography, point-and-shoots aren't fundamentally designed for video. But then again, since they all shoot video, people have begun using them more frequently than they ever used their bigger, more specialized camcorders, so a test was necessary.</p> <p>After playing some billiards, I found Canon's image, though not technically the highest resolution, to be the best. A point as well to its realistic sound capture of ball on ball action.<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/canonvideo.jpg" width="807" height="476" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <br> Second place goes to Kodak. Even though you can make out a great deal of grain on the table's felt surface, it also captures a relatively sharp, pleasantly contrasty image when you examine each ball.<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/kodakpicnewsss.jpg" width="807" height="445" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <br> Last place? This title is, once again, reserved for Panasonic. For some reason, the camera interpreted the red table as some sort of blurry pastel. And the sound was a like a fast food drive-through speaker.<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/panasonicvideo.jpg" width="807" height="454" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p><strong>Flash</strong><br> <br> We've all been there. It's late. A friend is in town. Your cameraphone can't hope to capture a shot in your drunken stupor, especially as you're hanging out in a smokey bar. I'd loved to have recreated this scene precisely in its brilliance, but instead I opted to take pictures of my cat with the lights low.<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/sonyflash.jpg" width="807" height="529" style="display:block;float:none;"><br> <br> It's an unfair challenge for a small-lensed, small-chipped camera to capture a decent picture in low light, even with flash as a crutch, but the Sony did as well as I could have hoped, illuminating my subject and her background alike, lacking the hotspots of most flash photography.</p> <p>The other cameras were predictably mediocre, but the absolute worst at handling flash had to be the Nikon. Not only did it give my cat a washed-out glow, but it didn't even consider properly exposing that obnoxious pile of boxes behind her. The shame.<br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/nikonflash.jpg" width="807" height="540" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p><strong>Weird Features and Gimmicks</strong><br> <br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/samsung-tl9.jpg" class="center" style="display:block;">None of these items should probably determine your buying decision, but I wanted to mention a few of the more...interesting features of the cameras. The Samsung TL9 has a set of snazzy analog dials on top that display battery life and remaining memory like a car's dash&mdash;plus it plays music and movies. The Panasonic has categorized an Intelligent Auto Mode that gives a lazy but informed user a nice way to tell the camera, "hey, you may need to boost the ISO," without messing with any other controls or gimmicky menus. The Nikon will warn you if a subject's eyes are closed. The Canon has ditched the standard up, down, left, right menu dial for a spinning ring...that's bold, if not always intuitive. And Sony will shoot in 16x9 or stretch images to that ratio for quick HDTV slideshows. Plus, smile/face detectors are everywhere. How did we ever take pictures before boxes enclosed a loved one's face?</p> <p><strong>So What Should You Buy?</strong><br> <br> After all my testing, I'd recommend the Canon SD790. Sure, it didn't win every category, but it won the one that counts most&mdash;detail. It came first in the video category. And it never ever fell flat on its face.</p> <p>Maybe this conclusion sounds a little too clinical to you. If so, let me say that there are less tangible elements I appreciate about the Canon SD790: It includes the best built battery charger and it is the only model tested to sync with a computer via mini USB (as opposed to some annoying proprietary cable or dock). On top of those, it always seems quick to capture a shot after I pressed for the shutter, though it's still not nearly as responsive as my prosumer DSLR. The one thing I'd ask for in this camera is a more powerful zoom lens (something you can get in the Canon line for a few bucks more).</p> <p>If you know an extreme technophobe, you might tell them about the Kodak M1093. It offers the simplest shooting experience with one button to choose a photo mode, one button for flash toggling and one button to actually take a picture. Digital cameras don't get simpler than that, and I have to admit, as the cheapest model in this roundup ($200), with the least techie brand name, it performs better than I expected&mdash;though it does have a propensity to bump the ISO, producing some unwanted noise.</p> <p>But as for the Sony W170, while it does feature the widest angle lens with 5x of zoom, it's clunky in the hand and rarely brilliant in quality. As for the Nikon S560, it takes mediocre shots. The Panasonic FS20 is inconsistent&mdash;bordering on horrendous much of the time&mdash;and features a small screen and a dated interface. Meanwhile, the Samsung TL9 just completely fails to impress me.</p> <p>So go ahead, pick up the Canon. It seems the company's overwhelming market share is well deserved. Or don't. I won't lose sleep or anything. Just don't come crying to me when all your pictures look like crap.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ At Gizmodo Gallery: The Full List of Wonderful Stuff ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/11/GizmodoGalleryAnnex.jpg" style="display:block;" />For a few weeks you've been hearing about the Gizmodo Gallery in NYC, catching <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/gizmodo-gallery/">plenty of teasers</a> for the cool stuff&mdash;contemporary marvels, homemade wundergear and pieces of history&mdash;we're showing down at the Reed Annex on Orchard St. from today 12 noon through Sunday 4pm. Now, for the first time, we're revealing <i>the whole list</i>.

			<title><![CDATA[ Giz Explains: Why OS X Shrugs Off Viruses Better Than Windows ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/windowosxvirus.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="804" height="359" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/apple/Why_OS_X_Shrugs_Off_Viruses_Off_Better_Than_Windows'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>Mac OS X, mythically immune to common computer plagues, has actually always <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5100996/false-alarm-apple-mac-os-x-anti+virus-recommendation-is-old">welcomed antivirus software</a>. Or, uh, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5101266/apple-removes-antivirus-support-note-reiterates-os-xs-built+in-protection">maybe not</a>. Confused? No worries&mdash;here's how OS X and Windows differ on resisting viruses and other nasties.</p> <p>It's not a matter of opinion: OS X <em>is</em> less susceptible to catching a cold than Windows. So is Linux, for that matter. There are two major reasons (and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5100217/the-simpsons-gets-20-years-of-apple-jokes-out-of-the-way-at-once">Steve Jobs' pee</a> actually isn't one of them). First, Windows is <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/154800/.html">on 89.6 percent of the world's personal computers</a>, while OS X is on just 8.9 percent of them. Second, the Unix architecture that OS X and Linux are based on is inherently more secure than Windows, particularly pre-Vista versions. (If these reasons are familiar to you, you may not know the subtler side-effects of each reason that strengthen the case even more, so read on.)</p> <p>There are a few different ways that Microsoft's mammoth market share actually hurts Windows and helps OS X. For one, writing nastiness that the vast majority of the world's personal computers are susceptible to is a more efficient use of resources than writing the same evil for a sliver of the population. In biology, a more homogeneous population is more susceptible to a genocidal plague. Same principle applies to the vast, Windows-powered ecosystem. I don't mean someone could write a virus that wipes <i>everybody</i> out. Just that if everybody's running Windows, the population is a much easier target.</p> <p>The flipside of this&mdash;which you might not have considered&mdash;is that most malware writers obviously use Windows. They're going to whip up code for the OS they're familiar with and know best. And more to that point, most of the tools and scripts used to wreak havoc on computers are written for Windows. The same ecosystem that provides the biggest, most susceptible audience also provides the most fertile breeding ground for the nasty executables.</p> <p>But suppose this was some bizarro world where OS X was king. Would Microsoft run ads about how virus-plagued OS X was? Well, it would still be more prudent to run anti-virus software, since there'd be a lot more crap thrown at the Mac OS, but if malware acted mostly like it does today, it likely wouldn't have the same impact as it did on Windows pre-Vista.</p> <p>A lot of that is because of the way permissions work in OS X vs. Windows. Basically, Unix-based systems are architected so that they require administrator privileges to modify the OS and are traditionally more strict in enforcing them. Critical areas are walled off from normal users&mdash;you see this when OS X asks for a password to install updates or change a system setting. A standard non-admin user account is restricted; bad software can't wreak much havoc at all without that password.</p> <p>This is precisely what Vista's somewhat-maligned User Account Control attempts to replicate, limiting points of intrusion and requiring explicit user permission to get anywhere deep. On Windows, historically, the enforcement of these restrictions has been lax in the name of convenience.</p> <p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9007883&pageNumber=1">This is not to say</a> that OS X is invulnerable, <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2424-9595_22-251586.html">by any means</a>. The main applications folder is <a href="http://www.macforensicslab.com/ProductsAndServices/index.php?main_page=document_general_info&cPath=11&products_id=174">relatively unprotected</a>, and any running app can write to it and most of what's inside. Coupled with OS X's app-bundling architecture, this makes it easier to replace program executables or sneak in a piggybacking one. Even then, however, the malware would need to elicit elevated permissions to do any hardcore damage to the core OS; it could, unfortunately, nuke your relatively unprotected Home folder though. Another point of vulnerability, or at least a pain point, according to Mac Forensics Lab, is OS X's centralized address book, which also has weak defenses. If the Home folder book did require the same level of permissions, it would be kinda unusable, because you'd have to elevate permissions to make any and every change.</p> <p>This brings us to OS X's biggest security hole, the one that it actually shares with every operating system: you. It doesn't matter how good baked-in security is if a user throws out the welcome mat for whatever crap comes their way. On the flip side, you're also the first, and best, line of protection. Don't do anything stupid, and you'll be fine, anti-virus software or not&mdash;whatever OS you're running.</p> <p><em>Something you still wanna know?

			<title><![CDATA[ False Alarm: Apple Mac OS X Anti-Virus Recommendation Is Old ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228246664653_mr-t-antivirus_01.jpg" width="804" height="367" style="display:block;float:none;" /></p> <div style='float:right; margin-left:-9px;'><script type="text/javascript"> digg_skin = 'compact'; digg_bgcolor = '#f1f8fa'; digg_url = 'http://digg.com/apple/False_Alarm_Apple_Mac_OS_X_Anti_Virus_Recommendation_Is_Old'; </script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"> </script></div> <p>The Washington Post, the BBC, Cnet, and other outlets are pointing out that Apple is, for the first time ever, "quietly" recommending anti-virus software for Mac OS X. A little research shows that this is completely false.</p> <p>Here's the Apple note they point at, postulating the old theory that Apple is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2008/12/can_the_mac_catch_a_cold.html">feeling the heat of the increased market share</a> and, therefore, an increasing risk of virus attacks:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/newvirus.jpg" width="728" height="558" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7760344.stm">BBC labels this as the result of a "fresh threat"</a>. The <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/12/apple_mac_users_should_get_ant.html?nav=rss_blog">Washington Post wonders</a> if they will stop showing their Mac and PC "Virus" TV Commercial. Cnet goes as far as saying that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10110852-83.html">"Apple changes its tune by advising Mac users to install antivirus software in nod that even Mac users aren't immune to rising malware threats."</a> (they have edited their story after it was demonstrated false by some internet users). The reality is that the note above is just an update to this support article from <b>2007</b>:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/oldvirus.jpg" width="728" height="574" style="display:block;float:none;"></p> <p>The new tech support note, which even shows the reference from the old article, only lists new anti-virus software versions. This is normal in tech notes.</p> <p>In fact, the old tech note itself is actually nothing new either: Apple offered anti-virus software as part of their .Mac subscription. In fact, the company has been recommending virus software since the pre-Unix years.</p> <p>In other words: No conspiracy theories, no "quietly published" technical notes. Just the same old recommendation they have been doing forever.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Nokia N97 Unveiled, The First High-End N-Series Touch Phone ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/12/n97_shot_1_800.jpg" width="800" height="532" style="display:block;float:none;" />It's been a long time coming, but after dabbling with touch on the midrange <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5058030/nokia-5800-xpressmusic-hands+on-with-nokias-first-s60-touch-phone">5800</a>, Nokia has finally brought a touchscreen to an S60 "N-Series" smartphone, the N97. Take a look at our hands-on impressions and the complete rundown on Nokia's new flagship. <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"> galleryPost('nokian97', 6, ''); </script></p> <p>But it's not quite a full dive into touch—there's still a horizontal QWERTY keyboard hidden below the 3.5" 640x360 resistive touchscreen and accesable via a smooth 30&deg; flip mechanism. The N97 will run an even further touch-enhanced Symbian OS, S60 v5, which features the 5800's quick contacts bar and adds an assortment of customizable desktop widgets that can pipe in your Facebook info, RSS feeds and the like, much like those found on Nokia's internet tablet OS. The widgets will be open to third party developers and available via the traditional "Downloads" Symbian app "for now" says Nokia—so not quite the App Store equivalent fans would hope for, but customization via software add-ons is definitely the route being pursued here.</p> <p>But alas, the downsides. Characteristically for Nokia, the N97 is aimed at Europe and Asia first. So big ballers in Moscow and Macau can expect to be toting an N97 sometime in the "first half of 2009," with a U.S. release (with the appropriate 3G bands) to follow "soon after." In Europe it'll run a hefty &euro;550 ($695) unsubsidized.</p> <p>The model we briefly handled tonight in NYC was, of course, the Euro version, with no U.S. 3G (and, sadly, no Wi-Fi network availabile). Its handlers were keeping it close to the vest, and with no connectivity there wasn't much testing to be done, but we can say that the hardware is indeed pretty—befitting a $700 Nokia piece. The desktop Symbian widgets look nice, but the drawbacks of a resistive touchscreen (there, as always, to ensure character recognition via a stylus for Nokia's Asian market) were immediately noticeable when dragging widgets around the desktop. A resistive touchscreen relies on pressing two layers of screen together with a fingernail or stylus to register a signal, so it is not as responsive as a capacitive screen which is driven by the natural electricity in your fingers (<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5036516/giz-explains-the-magic-behind-touchscreens">more on the difference here</a>).</p> <p>Rounding out the gaudy specs are 32GB of on-board memory (with 16GB more available via microSD), A-GPS with Nokia's refreshed Maps 3.0 app and a compass, accelerometer for landscape/portrait screen switching, 5MP camera with Zeiss lens and LED flash, 3.5mm headphone jack, and N-Gage support.</p> <p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2O2Li74EYew&hl=en&fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2O2Li74EYew&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></object></p> <p>Full press release follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Desktop. Laptop. Pocket: The era of the personal Internet dawns with the Nokia N97</p> <p>Tilting touch display, QWERTY keyboard and personalized home screen - a true mobile computer.</p> <p>Barcelona, Spain – Nokia today unveiled the Nokia N97, the world’s most advanced mobile computer, which will transform the way people connect to the Internet and to each other. Designed for the needs of Internet- savvy consumers, the Nokia N97 combines a large 3.5” touch display with a full QWERTY keyboard, providing an ‘always open’ window to favorite social networking sites and Internet destinations. Nokia’s flagship Nseries device introduces leading technology – including multiple sensors, memory, processing power and connection speeds – for people to create a personal Internet and share their ‘social location.’</p> <p>“From the desktop to the laptop and now to your pocket, the Nokia N97 is the most powerful, multi-sensory mobile computer in existence,” said Jonas Geust, Vice President, heading Nokia Nseries. “Together with the Ovi services announced today, the Nokia N97 mobile computer adjusts to the world around us, helping stay connected to the people and things that matter most. With the Nokia N97, Nseries leads the charge in helping to transform the Internet into your Internet”.</p> <p>The Nokia N97 introduces the concept of ‘social location’. With integrated A-GPS sensors and an electronic compass, the Nokia N97 mobile computer intuitively understands where it is. The Nokia N97 makes it easy to update social networks automatically with real-time information, giving approved friends the ability to update their ‘status’ and share their ‘social location’ as well as related pictures or videos.</p> <p>The home screen of the Nokia N97 mobile computer features the people, content and media that matter the most. Friends, social networks and news are available by simply touching the home screen. The 16:9 widescreen display can be fully personalized with frequently updated widgets of favorite web services and social networking sites. The Nokia N97 is also perfectly suited for browsing the web, streaming Flash videos or playing games. Both the physical QWERTY and virtual touch input ensure efficiency in blogging, chatting, posting, sending texts or emailing.</p> <p>The Nokia N97 supports up to 48 GB of storage, including 32 GB of on-board memory, expandable with a 16 GB microSD card for music, media and more. This is complemented by excellent music capabilities, full support for the Nokia Music Store and continuous playback time of up to 1.5 days. The Nokia N97 also has a 5- Megapixel camera with high-quality Carl Zeiss optics, 16:9 and DVD quality video capture, and support for services like Share on Ovi for immediate sharing over HSDPA and WLAN.</p> <p>The Nokia N97 is expected to begin shipping in the first half of 2009 at an estimated retail price of EUR 550 before taxes or subsidies.</p> </blockquote> ]]></description>
