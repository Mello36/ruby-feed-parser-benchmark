<p>Al-Dhahabî, <em>Siyar A’lâm Al-Nubalâ`</em> in his biography of Al-Fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span>ayl b. ‘Ayyâ<span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<p>Wanting good for the Muslim rulers and supplicating to Allâh for them features as an important aspect of the creed of Ahl Al-Sunnah wa Al-Jamâah, and distinguishes them from the extremist ideology of the Khawârij sect. This has been recorded in the classical works of Sunni ‘aqîdah, for example:</p>
<p>Al-Barbahârî (<em>Shar<span style="text-decoration: underline;">h</span> Al-Sunnah</em> p113, 114) states, “If you see a man supplicating against the ruler, know that he is a heretic (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>a<span style="text-decoration: underline;">h</span>ib hawâ), and if you see a man supplicating for the ruler, know that he is a Sunni – inshâ Allâh.”</p>
<p>Al-Imâm Al-Âjurrî (d360H) states (<em>Al-Sharî’ah</em> Vol.1 p371), “I have mentioned warnings against the ways of the Khawârij that convey the message for everyone who Allâh protects against the ways of the Khawârij, and who does not hold the views of the Khawârij, but is [instead] patient over the injustice of the rulers … and who prays for the wellbeing and righteousness of the rulers, and who does Hajj and Jihâd  behind the rulers against every enemy of the Muslims, and who prays the Jumu’ah and ‘Eid prayers behind the rulers. Whoever fits this description is upon the Straight Path – inshâ Allâh.”</p>
