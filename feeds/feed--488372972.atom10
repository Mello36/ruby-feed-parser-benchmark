			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/12/03/ncdm-show/" target="_blank">NCDM show</a>, old friend Sally Krumholz, who I knew through the <a href="http://www.internetoldtimersfoundation.org/modules/smartcontent/page.php?pageid=1" target="_blank">Internet Oldtimers Foundation</a>, has convinced me to do a gig while in Orlando.  I&#8217;ll be speaking to (the?) <a href="http://www.doterati.com/" target="_blank">doterati</a>, Central Florida&#8217;s interactive marketing, media and technology association Weds 12/10 at 6 PM.  <a href="http://doterati.com/events/what-can-web-analytics-do-for" target="_blank">Details here</a>.</p>
<p>The topic is <a href="http://doterati.com/events/what-can-web-analytics-do-for" target="_blank">What Can Web Analytics Do for You?</a>  Not the advanced class for sure, this presentation is really about <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/02/07/reporting-analysis/" target="_blank">moving from Reporting to Analysis</a> - aligning KPI&#8217;s with business goals and taking action on the data.  Sally figures that&#8217;s about the level the average doterati member is at - they run reports, but they&#8217;re too busy doing everything else to really get into the KPI and Action phase.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll also let them know about the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/webanalytics/" target="_blank">Yahoo Web Analytics list</a>, <a href="http://www.webanalyticsassociation.org/" target="_blank">the WAA</a>, the <a href="http://www.tech.ubc.ca/webanalytics/" target="_blank">UBC / WAA courses</a>, the <a href="http://www.webanalyticsassociation.org/en/cms/?612" target="_blank">books</a>, etc.</p>
<p>But, if you&#8217;re a web analytics Pro, there still may be a reason to stop by - I hear this event may be a warm up for the area&#8217;s first <a href="http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wednesday/waw_faq.asp" target="_blank">Web Analytics Wednesday</a>.  So a strong WA Pro showing would help push that idea along, if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Hope to see ya there!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week I will be moderating a panel at the NCDM show. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know NCDM?  If you&#8217;re a web analyst interested in what happens in BI from a Marketing perspective, this is the show for you - <a href="http://www.ncdmevents.com/ncdm2008/public/enter.aspx" target="_blank">National Center for Database Marketing</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m moderating a &#8220;shootout&#8221; panel titled <a href="http://www.ncdmevents.com/ncdm2008/public/SessionDetails.aspx?SessionID=1630" target="_blank">Web Analytics Solutions Showdown: How Do You Measure Customer Engagement?</a> with panelists Barry Parshall from WebTrends, <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">John Squire from Coremetrics, and David Kirschner from Omniture (Jon Gibson / ClickTracks had to drop out).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">No right or wrong answers for this session, mostly a demonstration of how different WA platforms approach the challenge of &#8220;Measuring Engagement&#8221; differently.  Just tell us what you believe &#8220;Engagement&#8221; is and how it is measured with your tool using a case study.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Then moderated audience tears your vendor heart out.  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Should be a hoot!</span></p>
<p>I came up with this idea because I thought it would be quite useful for the NCDM audience to see what web analytics looks like when it mimics traditional offline database marketing thinking.  An &#8220;outreach&#8221; kind of idea, from a Web Analytics Association perspective, if you know what I mean.  And these BI folks, they can be a very tough crowd, they&#8217;ve seen a lot of this before, just from different data / systems.</p>
<p>In fact, there are tons of BI people out there who want to learn as much about WA as they can, because they can <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/11/07/web-intelligence/" target="_blank">see what is coming</a>, they want to figure out how to merge offline and online Intelligence.  And by my way of thinking, &#8220;Engagement&#8221; - however you want to measure it - is probably the single most important data export WA offers into the BI world.</p>
<p>Why?  Because BI can&#8217;t measure the &#8220;high funnel&#8221; nearly as well as WA can.  But this capability is also the curse of WA, because there&#8217;s so much irrelevant data.  So what BI really wants to know is this: How do I define and extract the <strong>important</strong> events (<a href="http://semphonic.blogs.com/semangel/2008/11/warehousing-web-analytics-data-finding-magic-moments-.html" target="_blank">what Gary calls Magic Moments</a>) from WA data?</p>
<p>If you are going to the NCDM show, hope to see you there!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not clear why this show could be really important to your web or business analyst career, read the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/11/07/web-intelligence/" target="_blank">post on Web Intelligence</a>, and then read <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2008/12/web-analytics-career-advice.html" target="_blank">I am an Analytics God, I want more $$.  How?</a> by Avinash and think about the 4 paths he describes.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, I went with the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/marketing-bands-series/" target="_blank">HSN analytics team</a> to NCDM.  We were the only team talking about getting data in real time (from the live show) and overnight customer updates.  Everybody else was dealing with lags of a month if not a quarter to get data.   On the way home we were all were wondering if HSN was a unique case, that this idea of running a business &#8220;interactively, in real time&#8221; was something other companies simply would never have to deal with.  How would the systems interact?  How would you deal with the Latency issues between &#8220;interactive&#8221; and &#8220;regular&#8221; business? </p>
<p>What is the value of &#8220;transient data&#8221; versus &#8220;static data&#8221;, of group versus segment versus individual behavior?  How much transient data do you need to store, how do you convert transient group and segment data into individual static data that is meaningful?  </p>
<p>15 years later, I&#8217;m proud to explore those very ideas in this session with the attendees at NCDM.</p>
<p>By the way, if you&#8217;re sticking to the tech track up the BI ladder, the show for the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/08/10/marketing-technology-interface/" target="_blank">opposite side of the brain</a> to NCDM is the <a href="http://www.tdwi.org/" target="_blank">TDWI show</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is from the <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a href="http://www.jimnovo.com/newsletter-11-2008.htm" target="_blank">November 2008 Drilling Down Newsletter</a></span>.  Got a question about Customer Measurement, Management, Valuation, Retention, Loyalty, Defection?  Just <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/about-blog/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ask your question</span></a>.  Also, feel free to leave a comment. </p>
<p>Want to see the answers to previous questions?  The pre-blog newsletter archives are <a href="http://www.jimnovo.com/newsletters.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Offline Engagement Modeling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In our business (airline) - particularly on the loyalty side - we&#8217;ve been using both <a href="http://www.jimnovo.com/RFM-tour.htm" target="_blank">RFM</a> as well as lifetime and current cumulative totals.  For instance in our mileage program, we look at both lifetime miles earned and used as well as current balance. </p>
<p>Does that seem appropriate?</p>
<p><strong>A:  </strong>Well, I guess the question is appropriate for what purpose, what action are you driving to?</p>
<p>For example, if you were to divide metrics into &#8220;strategic&#8221; and &#8220;tactical&#8221;, meaning &#8220;for management / long-term planning&#8221; and &#8220;for campaigns / taking short-term action&#8221; then you get different answers.</p>
<p><span id="more-273"></span></p>
<p>Lifetime Miles earned is more of a strategic idea, as in &#8220;how many folks do we have that have flown over 100,000 miles?&#8221; and of course you want to see that number grow over time.  If it doesn&#8217;t, there may be some fundamental flaw in the business that needs to be addressed by management - service, scheduling, pricing, something beyond the every-day sort of campaign stuff that Marketing might handle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you combine LifeTime Miles with &#8220;source&#8221;, as in how did we acquire this customer, and you find out 50% of the folks with over 100,000 Lifetime Miles joined the Loyalty program through an offer made in Amex credit card statements, you now have a tactical idea that tells you to focus on more marketing opportunities like the one that generated 50% of your best customers.</p>
<p>As far as miles used and current balance, we know that in loyalty programs, redeemers tend to be the least likely to defect - they are paying attention and the awards are attractive. In other words, the metric &#8220;percent customers redeeming&#8221; rising means the program is structured well, customers like it, and the program is doing the job.</p>
<p>There are basically two types of redeemers - savers and spenders. If you are going to &#8220;take action&#8221; from a marketing perspective, you can look at other metrics that are more along the lines of Customer Engagement for these different behavioral segments.</p>
<p>For example, large unused balances can be indicative of &#8220;saving&#8221;, as long as the balances are below the top rewards.  When they go over the top rewards and keep growing, that&#8217;s a sign of customer apathy among best customers towards the program.  So you can look at various &#8220;thresholds&#8221; and decide what kind of action to take to keep the program fresh and exciting for best customers.</p>
<p>For point spenders - those that use points to upgrade or fly free as soon as they have enough to cover the redemption - you might wonder why these folks would pass the normal threshold foe these activities and keep saving.  If you see this behavior combined with a slowdown in trip frequency, you start to worry about a defection and take action through &#8220;double points&#8221; offerings or special rewards designed to maintain engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It&#8217;s very easy to create lots of RFM style scores - but is there any way to combine them into a single usable metric - even along a single dimension.  For instance in the very simplest case - is there a way to combine the level of importance of R, F, and M by understanding their relative importance on future <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/04/25/engagement-customers/" target="_blank">potential value</a>?  <a href="http://www.jimnovo.com/LTV.htm" target="_blank">LTV</a>?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well again, it kind of depends what you are using all this information for.  Most of the predictive power of RFM is in Recency, so if predicting defection is what triggers marketing action you can skip the &#8220;FM&#8221; and just use R.  But if you are scoring folks because you are reporting on valuation or want to know relative rankings of customers by Value and likelihood to defect then you need all the parts.</p>
<p>Sure, you can create any kind of &#8220;summing&#8221; algo you want and turn it into a &#8220;single number&#8221;.  If you are talking about some kind of management reporting, and you&#8217;re just trying to simplify for the exec level, why not?</p>
<p>But, here&#8217;s the problem with summing disparate metrics that don&#8217;t have the same fundamentals.  If you lose the detail and are talking about using scores for marketing actions, most of the time you end up kicking yourself for not saving the detail and you need to go back and recreate it by unraveling the equations.</p>
<p>Plus, Recency is very unlike any of the Frequency or Volume-oriented metrics - the base is Time, not Activity.  This will lead to interpretation problems down the road, as the interactions between the Activity / Volume and Time vectors (<a href="http://www.jimnovo.com/images/value-model.jpg" target="_blank">Current Value / Potential Value</a>) are the most powerful ideas to act on in terms of Customer ROI, not a subjective blend of these disparate ideas.</p>
<p>Also, just to clarify in case there is some confusion, most customers will have many different RFM scores during their LifeCycle, so RFM score <strong>in itself</strong> in not predictive of terminal value.  Variables surrounding the acquisition and servicing of the customer - the customer experience - <strong>are predictive</strong> of LTV, but RFM score is not.  You need to be looking at campaign source of customer, what routes they fly, what times of day they fly, behavior in the loyalty program, etc. to predict LTV.</p>
<p>What RFM is predictive of is &#8220;the delta&#8221; from a point at time when the score is assigned, the &#8220;future&#8221; part of LTV.  RFM ranks customers against each other for magnitude of future value and likelihood of capturing this future value at a point in time - the Potential Value. As I said above, you can use Recency alone for a proxy, but I don&#8217;t think that is going to get you where I think you want to go.</p>
<p>And to clarify, an RFM score does predict along a single dimension, if I understand your meaning of dimension.  If you score purchases, you get a likelihood of purchase; if you use visits to score you get a likelihood to visit, but not to purchase.</p>
<p>I think what you are trying to ask is how you combine all these various RFM scores that each predict a single action into a single, more complex and accurate prediction; and to me that means you are ready for CHAID, CART, and regression models.  Congratulations!  They are much easier to build with a rich data set of existing behavioral scoring data like the RFM data set you seem to have.</p>
<p>So for example, imagine you have dozens of RFM scores on different behaviors.  You identify some high value defectors, and the question is this: which of these dozens of scores is <strong>most</strong> predictive of the defection, or in what <strong>order of importance</strong> are they in making a prediction of defection?  You are looking for &#8220;patterns&#8221; of RFM scores that predict a defection, for example &#8220;high RFM score on miles with a rapidly increasing RFM score on calls to customer service&#8221;, meaning a best customer is having service trouble.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve now crossed into the advanced behavioral modeling area, because now you are talking about using multiple variables to predict a behavior; you&#8217;re looking for &#8220;weights&#8221; to apply to a bunch of different data points that result in &#8220;single usable metric&#8221; you can use to describe a customer.</p>
<p>These advanced models sound like the next chapter in your customer-centric quest.  I don&#8217;t think you will ever get to a &#8220;single usable metric&#8221; - you will need a separate model for each likelihood you are trying to predict - but you can get to the idea of &#8220;single usable metric along a single dimension&#8221; using many different inputs with these models.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year just before the holiday season we take a look at the customer database for the Lab Store - <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/01/25/lab-store/" target="_blank">the online retail biz my wife runs</a> - and see what&#8217;s up with 10x or more buyers.</p>
<p>I often prefer to look at &#8220;worst case&#8221; data when doing customer analysis; this way you don&#8217;t over-estimate the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/07/16/friction-model/" target="_blank">Potential Value</a> of the business going forward.  The beginning of the 4th Quarter is a good time to do this since &#8220;holiday&#8221; really hasn&#8217;t kicked in yet, so you don&#8217;t have those buying influences skewing the natural activity in the customer database.</p>
<p>At the end of September, we took a look at all customers, no matter when they became customers,  who have purchased from us at least 10 times - a best customer analysis.  Considering a &#8220;year&#8221; to be 9/30 to 9/29,  we bucketed them by when their <strong>last purchase was -</strong> past year, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 or more years ago (the business started 5 years ago).</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p>Last purchase date was in               Percentage of all 10x or more Buyers</p>
<p>9/30/07 -  9/29/08                                 75%</p>
<p>9/30/06 -  9/29/07                                 12%</p>
<p>9/30/05 -  9/29/06                                   8%</p>
<p>9/30/04 -  9/29/05                                   5%</p>
<p>If this data is still confusing, the second line above would read, &#8220;Of all customers who have ever bought 10x or more, 12% last purchased in the period 9/30/06 -  9/29/07.</p>
<p><span id="more-264"></span></p>
<p>75%  of the best, most productive customers (all else equal, like margins, service costs, etc.) we have ever had since the busines started are still active buyers with us. </p>
<p>Of course, this raises the question: What&#8217;s up with the rest of them?</p>
<p>When you segment like this, using the actual customer behavior, an analysis of each segment can be quite revealing.  What you are seeing is essentially a LifeCycle model, the attrition pattern of these best buyers.  No doubt some will come back, especially out of the &#8220;last year&#8221; 12% group, but here&#8217;s the thing - the longer they are inactive, the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/04/25/engagement-customers/">less likely they are to come back</a>.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re going to &#8220;do something&#8221; with this 12% Recent best defector group, the time to do it is now, going into holiday season, because you have buying momentum running with you.  That&#8217;s another reason we do this analysis at the end of September ;)</p>
<p>To optimize this action plan, you should know something about who these defectors are.  And here is where people make a huge mistake: because they&#8217;re inactive buyers, or in the case of non-commerce sites, inactive visitors, they are not being surveyed by the usual survey pops. </p>
<p>Let me say that again: arguably the most important segment of the customer base, dis-engaging  best customers, lacks voice under most approaches to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_the_customer" target="_blank">VOC</a>.  You have to reach out proactively to these people and find out what you did wrong; otherwise you will just keep doing it wrong and continue to churn off your best customers / visitors.</p>
<p>Got that?</p>
<p>A segmentation technique that is very helpful in this kind of analysis is to think in terms of controllable and uncontrollable customer defection.  Since the Lab Store is in the animal supplies business, the sale or death of the animal would create an uncontrollable defection - no amount of &#8220;Marketing&#8221; is going to get that customer back.  Other examples of uncontrollable defection would be when a cable or local newspaper customer moves out of the area serviced by the company, or a manufacturer ceases to produce a line and no longer needs parts.</p>
<p>We know from previous surveys of these defectors this uncontrollable population is about 4% a year.  So for each time span above, you can knock 4% off and get to the percent controllable defectors.  These are the people you really want to know about, because they are actionable.  So as far as the 12% &#8220;last year&#8221; group, it&#8217;s now about 8% of best buyers.</p>
<p>The first controllable defection trigger we would look for in the group would be Product.  Product drives everything in a commerce model; it&#8217;s why you exist as a commerce entity, and is fundamental to the Brand Promise.  If you have a product issue, no amount of Service or other drivers will fix the problem.  So Product is where you start.  Plus, you should have all the data you need, so it&#8217;s easier to get started on right away (no lag time).</p>
<p>Did these defecting best customers buy similar products which resulted in their defection?  In other words, something about the packaging, pricing, or performance of the product may be defective.  This type of analysis is how we discovered and cured the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/01/25/lab-store-managing-customer-experience/" target="_blank">staple food problem</a>.</p>
<p>The product analysis turned up an interesting trend, or non-trend, actually: while in general there were no hot spots among categories or products purchased by these folks, there was a surprising lack of purchases in the Toy category for the past year.  My first question upon seeing this: what toys have they bought from us in the past?</p>
<p>The answer: All of them.  About 70% of these defectors had purchased all the toys we carried at some point.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s several reasons we don&#8217;t carry many toys.  The community we serve is extremely sensitive to the issue of materials used in products they expose their animals to, and most animal toys don&#8217;t make that cut.  Then there is our general philosopy on avoiding commodity products and keeping product selection trimmed to <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/02/01/interview-podcast-jim-novo/" target="_blank">what people want to buy</a>.</p>
<p>But clearly, this looked like a specific, nailed down opportunity to put some effort into this area.</p>
<p>To confirm this idea, we sat down and invented a couple of products, contacted a sample of these defected best customers, and showed them what we were thinking in terms of the new toys.  This action confirmed two things for us:</p>
<p>1.  Indeed, one of the reasons they stopped buying from us is they already owned most of our toys, <strong>and</strong> their animals were not on our staple diet, so there was no recurring purchase need.</p>
<p>2.  They thought the new toys were very cool ideas - ultra safe materials, fair pricing, unique, etc.</p>
<p>So there you have it - our holiday best customer reactivation plan is set.  The items are up and we&#8217;ll  be dropping a promotional e-mail to<strong> just these defected best customers </strong>with an &#8220;insider deal&#8221; on the new toys.  The sales generated should be almost completely incremental due to the research we did, but we&#8217;ll <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/control-group-series/" target="_blank">use a control group anyway</a>, just to make sure we didn&#8217;t screw something up.</p>
<p>Now, I know a lot of people in this community would be running all kinds of statistical models and such against this defector data looking for the silver bullet, but what&#8217;s interesting about this case is:</p>
<p>1.  The segmentation was totally simple to do with a spreadsheet: Frequency cut with Recency dimension.  That&#8217;s it.  Anybody can do that, anybody.  No advanced stats needed.</p>
<p>2.  The &#8220;answer&#8221; was not something in the data, the answer was NOT in the data - lack of toy purchase. </p>
<p>Sure, there are ways to set up the modeling to find this out, but you would have to come up with the idea of &#8220;missing category&#8221; <strong>before</strong> you constructed the model.  Then you would have to make a judgement call on whether the 70% &#8221;purchased all toys&#8221; number was significant based on intimate knowledge of past customer analysis.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of skills Marketing should be bringing to the party, because the Tech side is often so very stuck in <a href="http://marketinggeek.blogspot.com/2008/11/binary-thinking.html" target="_blank">binary thinking</a>.  To optimize these Marketing systems, someone has to control for the problems caused by behavior chains like:</p>
<p>did not buy-&gt;<br />
so did not get surveyed-&gt;<br />
so did not uncover &#8220;lack of toys&#8221; problem</p>
<p>because the Tech side is always focused on what has happened, as opposed to what has <strong>not</strong> happened.</p>
<p>Might as well be Marketing who takes up this role, since solving &#8220;did not happen&#8221; problems almost always has a much higher ROI than looking at what did happen.  After all, a 4% conversion rate means 96% did not convert.</p>
<p>In solving this &#8220;did not happen&#8221; problem, we have<strong> both</strong> increased the potential for business with dis-engaged best customers <strong>and</strong> corrected a flaw in the system that would have continued to flush best buyers in the future.  One campaign, with <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/engagement-framework/" target="_blank">both Current and Potential Value</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the response rate and ROI on this best defector holiday campaign will be huge.  What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I said in an <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/10/16/see-ya-emetrics/#comment-56083" target="_blank">earlier comment</a>, I didn&#8217;t get to see many of the sessions at eMetrics DC due to a raft of WAA stuff and great interactions with the people at the show outside the sessions.  But I have seen a lot of commentary, notably from <a href="http://semphonic.blogs.com/semangel/2008/10/emetrics-redux-a-few-thoughts-from-the-conference.html" target="_blank">Gary</a>, <a href="http://judah.webanalyticsdemystified.com/2008/11/back-from-another-excellent-emetrics-marketing-optimization-summit-in-dc.html" target="_blank">Judah</a>, and <a href="http://blog.webanalyticsdemystified.com/weblog/2008/10/the-google-analytics-update-thoughts-and-implications.html" target="_blank">Eric</a>, and related, from <a href="http://christopher-berry.blogspot.com/2008/10/data-miners-and-web-analysts-unite.html" target="_blank">Christopher</a>, on the overall message.</p>
<p>I have to say I agree (or is it have agreed?) - web analytics is headed for the BI shop.  In what form, we can only speculate.  But I have a few ideas, and a great resource that could be quite helpful depending on where you want to go with your analytical career.</p>
<p>The Google Analytics API, for one thing, is going to be huge from a BI perspective.  Just exactly what you have access to and in what format will be an issue for some BI folks, who tend to want &#8220;all of it&#8221;.</p>
<p>If BI really wants all the data, WebTrends was talking about cleaving the reporting from the processing - just like a traditional BI scenario, where the analytics app sits on top of any warehouse.  But I think in general most BI folks are over-thinking this issue and in time, they are going to be more satisfied with the &#8220;right&#8221; data, as opposed to &#8220;all&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-268"></span></p>
<p>Here is what I mean.  I think you are going to see this split, where the higher level web analysts are going to head into BI, because they already know what they know, and what data is important.  BI will suck the &#8220;right&#8221; data out of the web anlaytics area and leave the rest of it.  Meanwhile, there will still be web analysts that will use &#8220;all the data&#8221;, but that will be pretty much relegated to what a lot of folks do now - straight traffic reporting, basic analysis, optimizing the web site at the campaign and page level, all that good stuff.  Important work, but for many business models, not mission critical.</p>
<p>Said another way, we&#8217;re going to get a split along Visitor versus Customer.  Web analytics will still be dealing with the transactional, backword-looking web stuff at the Tactical / Visitor level, and BI will handle data integration and all the forward looking stuff - Predictive analysis.  This means BI will be dealing with the C-Level and Strategic issues for the web.</p>
<p>Now, it certainly doesn&#8217;t have to turn out like this, and many shops using the advanced or Enterprise level web analytics platforms that run on a real data warehouse no doubt are already there - BI has come to the web analytics shop.  I suspect a lot of the pure online commerce folks are in this bucket.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many BI folks think of web analytics apps as &#8220;bridge technologies&#8221; that will have limited use once BI gets their hands on the raw web data.  I doubt this is really true in most cases; there will still be a need for &#8220;reporting&#8221; at the site level for optmization, and the BI folks I think dramtically underestimate the overhead of dealing with this kind of reporting in a data warehouse. </p>
<p>So, there is going to be a split, with commodity Visitor Reporting down the web analytics path and high value Customer Analysis / Insight moving into BI.  This means a potential player split as well.</p>
<p>Some players, on both the Tech and Marketing side, will stay with the commodity Visitor reporting side of the business.  Others on both sides will choose to move up into the BI world.</p>
<p>On the Tech side, a move up into BI means data warehousing, ETL, and that whole area, where a web analyst would be extremely valuable in terms of understanding and configuring the combined solution.  Pure analysts will start to grapple with (aggregated or <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/08/02/webtrends-score/" target="_blank">event</a>) web data in SPSS / SAS or similar apps.</p>
<p>On the Marketing side, it&#8217;s a move away from the Tactics of Advertising to the Strategy of Marketing, where you&#8217;re not just looking at the media but also customer service, product configuration / packaging, pricing, fulfillment - all the customer touchpoints.  This movement is well underway at companies that were born customer centric: catalogs, TV shopping, other <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/engagement-framework/" target="_blank">Relationship Marketers</a>.</p>
<p>To me, one of the great paradoxes of online is everybody <strong>talks </strong>about customer centricity but few actually <strong>measure</strong> anything at the customer level;  the non-stop blah blah blah is all about Visitors and Campaigns instead of Customers.</p>
<p>I think this paradox will start resolving itself during this next business cycle, since there is never more focus on customer analysis than there is in an economic downturn.  As I said in my presentation at eMetrics, it&#8217;s fairly easy to get into the prediction game with some simple analysis that is really Strategic in nature. </p>
<p>Imagine the power of predicting your business will be doing better or worse 3 months from now.  What are we doing right or wrong <strong>today</strong> that will help or hurt us <strong>in 3 months</strong>? </p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the BI / Customer angle brings to the party, for alas, web analytics / marketing has for the most part stubbornly refused to get into the Customer measurement game.  The general model and approach I presented at eMetrics, which I referred to as the Past / Last model (Frequency / Recency) for that audience - is on this blog, for <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/04/07/engagement-campaigns/" target="_blank">Campaigns</a>, <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/04/13/engagement-visitors/" target="_blank">Visitors</a>, and <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/04/25/engagement-customers/" target="_blank">Customers</a> -  if you are interested.</p>
<p>So, what to do about all this if you are a web analyst?</p>
<p>If you see yourself going the tech / warehouse route, and especially if you already have the <a href="http://www.tech.ubc.ca/webanalytics/" target="_blank">WAA / UBC Award of Achievement in Web Analytics</a>, I would consider going for the <a href="http://unex.uci.edu/certificates/it/web_intel/" target="_blank">Certificate in Web Intelligence from UCI</a>.  I heard a fabulous story at eMetrics from Shaina Boone at <a href="http://www.criticalmass.com/" target="_blank">Critical Mass</a> about some very intense warehouse stuff they are doing, and it&#8217;s working out quite well for the clients.  She&#8217;s in or completing the UCI Certificate program right now, and said this UCI material was a tremendous help with that task.</p>
<p>On the Marketing / Business side, are you one of those folks who can consistently pick the winners before the A/B testing even starts?  Or have you provided a solution that outperformed all of the machine testing just by looking at the page? </p>
<p>If so, you have developed deep insight and empathy for the customer, are a truly customer-centric thinker.  This kind of person can excel in execution on the BI side, Turning the Data into Profits.  Not by creating Campaigns, but designing entire Marketing Programs that may involve other areas like Customer Service. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for education in this area, check out some of the courses offered by the <a href="http://www.the-dma.org/seminars/" target="_blank">Direct Marketing Association</a> or read one of the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/05/26/database-marketing-books/" target="_blank">great books out there</a> on this topic.  The WAA is planning on expanding the Certificate program to cover these areas as well.</p>
<p>In the end, the difference between Visitor and Customer analysis is a matter of perspective.  Clearly a Visitor and a Customer can be the same entity; the difference is how you look at the data.</p>
<p>Visitor analysis tends to be very &#8220;one-off&#8221; transactional and is backward looking; Customer analysis tends to be about behavior over time and is <a href="http://minethatdata.blogspot.com/2008/11/wow-nordstrom-wow.html" target="_blank">forward looking / Predictive</a>. </p>
<p>For this reason, Visitor analysis tends to optimize towards performance &#8220;now&#8221; while Customer analysis optimizes for the future and is willing to take a hit in the present for higher ROI down the road. </p>
<p>Finally, Visitor analysis is very Marketing-centric while Customer analysis is often cross-functional, often dealing  with Content, Customer Service and Product issues as well as Marketing.</p>
<p>So, where are you headed?  Any thoughts on the above?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to leave the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/23/no-requirements-doc-for-online-marketing/" target="_blank">Requirements / Model</a> issue to simmer for a while; thanks for all your help exploring it.  I get the feeling people might want to connect with more practical ideas right now and not take on the windmills of the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/08/10/marketing-technology-interface/" target="_blank">Tech / Marketing Interface</a>.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll wrap up with a few relevant links to what others have recently said about this model / requirements problem.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook COO</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131534" target="_blank">Ad Age tells us</a> that Facebook&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Google and its competitors have made answering demands for information very profitable by selling ads attached to search requests, or demand fulfillment, Ms. Sandberg a former Google executive herself, noted.  &#8220;What no one&#8217;s figured out how to do is demand generation,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;We need to find a new model and new metrics,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/02/01/interview-podcast-jim-novo/" target="_blank">Serendipity problem</a>, right?  You can&#8217;t Search for what you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity" target="_blank">don&#8217;t know about already</a>?</p>
<p> <span id="more-265"></span></p>
<p>You say Demand Generation and Demand Fulfillment, I say <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/30/new-online-marketing-model/" target="_blank">Awareness and Interest</a>.  Same thing; Demand generation happens when people are made Aware of something, as opposed to having Interest already and Searching for it.  So we agree there.</p>
<p>I think where we might differ is I&#8217;m saying the web is simply too expensive for the Awareness it delivers <strong>because it&#8217;s intentionally decentralized.</strong>  I&#8217;m saying the very essence of the web, what makes the web the web, is a fundamentally poor structure for generating Awareness / Demand when compared with centralized media.</p>
<p>So while there may be a &#8221;new model&#8221; for Awareness / Demand out there somewhere, it will be inefficient compared to current media alternatives.  To keep trying to build a general purpose Awareness / Demand generation model on the web is <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/01/repeating-the-past/" target="_blank">Repeating the Past</a>.  Why don&#8217;t we just move on and create <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/30/new-online-marketing-model/#comment-53038" target="_blank">“Interest Platforms” instead of “Awareness Platforms”</a>?</p>
<p>Just to be perfectly clear, I am not saying Display &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work&#8221;.  What I am saying is that it doesn&#8217;t work <strong>well enough for the cost</strong> when compared to other Awareness media to be used for the purpose of generating Awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Search as Display, or Display as Search?</strong></p>
<p>Google-Click, if they feel generous, may provide some much needed data on <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/03/28/perfect-google-click-world/" target="_blank">what actually goes on between Display and Search</a> that will boost the value of Display.  After all, AdSense is really a (not very good) Interest platform, isn&#8217;t it?  But just to show I&#8217;m not a total wonk, some people are working on what might be a better Interest Platform. </p>
<p>Jonathan Mendez in <a href="http://www.optimizeandprophesize.com/jonathan_mendezs_blog/2008/10/display-becomes.html" target="_blank">Display Becomes Us</a> talks about <a href="http://blog.lookery.com/2008/09/28/a-comment-thread-with-fred/" target="_blank">Lookery</a> and the idea that Search could become &#8220;display advertising&#8217;s operating principle&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not exactly sure what this technology is up to, but it sounds like an &#8220;implied Interest&#8221; approach with higher quality than AdSense.  Personally, I doubt a database of search referrers can be as <strong>universally relevant</strong> as Search but it probably could work for some categories, and it absolutely has the promise to be much better than Display or AdSense, which both suffer from the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/30/new-online-marketing-model/#comment-53218" target="_blank">lean forward problem</a>.  Ar least you can <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/03/05/adsense-works/" target="_blank">fix this problem with AdSense</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Search Ads</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2007/10/02/your-ad-everywhere/" target="_blank">for some time</a> that if Social Media wants a monetization model that works (is relevant) they <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/16/wrong-model-dumb-money/" target="_blank">should try Search</a>.  But the Socials have repeatedly resisted going that way for some reason.  Now we have Facebook announcing that Search-driven monetization is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2008/10/07/facebook-friends-live-search.aspx" target="_blank">up and running with Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>I tried some searches and found not only relevant Facebook groups but also (shazzaam!) relevant ads.  It&#8217;s not Demand Generation, but it will probably make money, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><strong>Recursive Navel Gazing</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I would simply like to make the point again that just because certain highly specialized online Display promotions can be forced to work does not mean they are &#8220;Marketing Breakthroughs&#8221;, it just means they are so highly targeted they can&#8217;t fail (um, like Search?), which also means they cannot be rolled out in any volume - that old &#8220;Awareness problem&#8221; for the web again.</p>
<p>Selling Facebook widgets on Facebook or <a href="http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2008/09/bloggers-increase-hp-laptop-sales-85.html" target="_blank">HP Notebooks to people reading specific tech blogs</a> is not Marketing Genius, it&#8217;s shooting fish in a barrel.  There&#8217;s no Reach, and these efforts don&#8217;t Scale - elements critical to generating tangible Awareness.</p>
<p>The fact this kind of promotion works is simply evidence that <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/03/05/adsense-works/" target="_blank">hyper-contextual targeting works</a> on the web, which supports the general argument against an Awareness / Display platform on the web and for Search / Interest as the right model to be pursued.</p>
<p>Hey, at least some folks on the Tech side are moving forward!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, the call for a new <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/23/no-requirements-doc-for-online-marketing/" target="_blank">Online Marketing Requirements doc</a> to correct the <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/09/16/wrong-model-dumb-money/" target="_blank">Wrong Model, Dumb Money problem</a> did not get much traction so far.  So I&#8217;m thinking maybe you need a new Online Marketing Model first to hang the Requirements doc on.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the challenge: I don&#8217;t think there is a universal enough agreement on what online brings to the Marketing party.  Sure, it gets explained in tons of ways, but for the most part these explanations are all Tactical stuff - do this, get that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not good enough, that&#8217;s too small, and it&#8217;s not unique to online.  CEO&#8217;s and CMO&#8217;s are looking for the Strategy edge, and they are looking for ways Online is a &#8220;logical fit&#8221; into the Marketing Mix.  What is online &#8220;for&#8221;, and perhaps more importantly, what can it do better than what we already have?</p>
<p>This is important because if you can get to this place, then you have leverage, then you have the ability to draw more money into Online Marketing / Analysis -<strong> because it is different</strong>.</p>
<p> <span id="more-262"></span></p>
<p>When everything we come up with replicates the Offline model but doesn&#8217;t work as well - take Display advertising, for example, the business model most every &#8220;new idea&#8221; uses - then how would you expect to get any respect?  Seriously, it looks ridiculous from outside the small world (Marketing budget-wise) of Online.  What other medium relentlessly pursues a failed business model so persistently, hoping something will change?  There are exceptions.  But most of these exceptions play in such a small sandbox or are so recursive (selling Facebook widgets on Facebook) they are irrelevant to the broad scope of Marketing (<a href="http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2008/09/bloggers-increase-hp-laptop-sales-85.html" target="_blank">example</a>).  They don&#8217;t scale.</p>
<p>I have always loved the <strong>Lean Back versus Lean Forward </strong>model<strong> - </strong>one of the earliest attempts at explaining why online is different.  The first time I heard this phrase, back in 1997 on the ClickZ discussion list (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_in_peace" target="_blank">RIP</a>), I knew exactly what it meant.  It&#8217;s visual and I could immediately write a page or two describing the &#8220;Online Difference&#8221; this idea implies.  But I&#8217;m a Behaviorist, I get all the implications of this idea.  Problem is:</p>
<p>1. The vast majority of Marketers are not Behaviorists, they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_Rating_Point" target="_blank">GRP</a>-ists.  For these people, Marketing is about demographics and psychographics, not Behavior.</p>
<p>2.  Lean Back / Lean Forward is probably too abstract to be very directional for the Technologists, they can&#8217;t get to the Requirements from there.  And direction is what they need.</p>
<p>3.  I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;Either - Or&#8221; models in Marketing, just too cute.  I often talk about the concept of a <a href="http://www.customerthink.com/forum/push_vs_pull_crm" target="_blank">&#8220;slider&#8221; on a continuum</a> between ideas like Brand versus Direct (like a Low - High Volume control).  Marketing is always a mix, and the Optimal slider position between ideas like this varies by product, media, audience, etc.  Marketing is not an Either - Or concept, much as I&#8217;m sure some would like to think it is.  Would be more convenient for the Tech side!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to try to convince you what the right model might be here.  I would much rather have a discussion about concepts, and build the model together.  But I will tell you something that keeps coming to my mind over and over as we watch all this play out, as the different business models succeed and fail.  I see a high-level commonality running though all the results to date.</p>
<p>As you probably know, I&#8217;m into Marketing Productivity - Online and Offline.  I want to generate the highest, most accountable return to the company I possibly can on Marketing spend.  This attitude does <strong>not mean</strong> I can turn every dollar spent into an ROI equation.  I look for probabilities, likelihoods, any signs I can find of Marketing impact.</p>
<p>When I look at the Marketing world through this lens, and holding true to the Psych model <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/tag/aidas/" target="_blank">AIDAS</a> (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action, Satisfaction) that describes how humans process Marketing information, here is where I land:</p>
<p>Media - offline or online - are in the business of aggregating audiences.  Marketers want to access those audiences to spread messages.  The fundamental &#8220;model&#8221; problem I see is a dimensional one, meaning how the audiences are &#8220;described&#8221; or segmented.</p>
<p>In offline media, all you have is demographics, maybe psychographics.  This is useful because you can quantify Reach and Frequency and talk about &#8220;Awareness&#8221; among a certain population, the first step in the AIDAS model.  Online, the very nature of the activity - the &#8220;Lean Forward&#8221; idea - is past Awareness in the AIDAS Path. </p>
<p>Thinks about this: are Demographics and Psychographics relevant when you have Interest?  Do you care what the characterisitics of an audience are when they are <strong>already Interested</strong>?</p>
<p>Online, you are talking about audiences that have reached the Interest stage already.  This is why &#8220;Broadcast&#8221; or Display messaging is so irrelevant to these audiences <a href="http://blog.jimnovo.com/2008/03/05/adsense-works/" target="_blank">unless it is hyper-contextually targeted</a>.  They literally <strong>don&#8217;t care to be Aware of other things when they already have Interest in a specific thing</strong>.  Their minds tend to be shut to Awareness in this mode.</p>
<p>And this is what Online brings to the media party that is new, is different, is desirable.  Something very difficult to find Offline - the idea of Aggregated Interest - and a reason to invest in Online. </p>
<p>In other words, Dollar for Dollar spent,</p>
<p><strong>Offline</strong> is more efficient at aggregating<strong> Awareness</strong> than Online</p>
<p><strong>Online</strong> is more efficient at aggregating <strong>Interest</strong> than Offline</p>
<p>If you have Marketing budget to waste, I&#8217;d agree this line of thinking is probably irrelevant.  But if you&#8217;re looking for the highest and best use of that budget, does this idea make sense to you?</p>
<p>Can we start building the new Online Marketing Model from here?  If the Tech side developed more &#8221;Interest tech&#8221; and less &#8220;Awareness tech&#8221;, don&#8217;t you think Online Marketing would be better off?</p>
