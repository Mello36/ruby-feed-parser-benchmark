<p>And so, if you&#8217;re a dreamer, this can be true. Today is the anniversary of John Lennon&#8217;s shooting and death. I remember where I was and when I was when it happened. I was a 13 year old, brace-faced, Beatle fanatic with my first guitar (first song, Let It Be - McCartney, I know) on a family vacation in Florida when I found out. I was upset then and I&#8217;m upset now - by the waste of what could have been. By the knowledge that he was just beginning again, That he seemed comfortable in his own skin and ready to join the world again and matter. John Lennon was no saint, but he was a symbol, an idealist and he had a powerful voice and influence.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.tech-no-phile.com/blog/uploads/apples.jpeg" alt="War Is Over If You Want It" /><br />
And what does this have to do with the blog? Not much really. There are ongoing <a title="Beatles and iTunes" href="http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-beatles-tracks-not-coming-to-itunes-any-time-soon-mccartney-talks-at-an/" target="_blank">negotiations and setbacks</a> concerning the Beatles appearance on iTunes. Other than that I just wanted to mark Lennon&#8217;s passing as I often think about him at this time. Perhaps others have thoughts as well they&#8217;d like to share. I truly believe that war (all kinds of war - military, mental etc&#8230;) is over if we want it - perhaps we don&#8217;t like to admit that, sometimes,  we don&#8217;t really want it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the heels of <a title="Microsoft Ship is sinking?" href="http://www.9to5mac.com/microsoft-dying-slowly" target="_blank">the report that Microsoft is losing</a> further ground in both web browser share and market share - it has dipped below 90% for the first time in quite a long while  - and Apple&#8217;s share rising to 9.25% (10 times less, but come on&#8230;) I wanted to share this great piece of near nostalgia. This is pre-iPod, pre-Intel, pre-everything really great and cool. Apple also <a title="A bright spot" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/12/01/apple_a_bright_spot_during_lackluster_black_friday_kick_off.html" target="_blank">posted better than average</a> sales on Black Friday at it&#8217;s stores and was a bright spot on an otherwise lackluster holiday season kickoff in the US. Click on the link if you don&#8217;t see the embedded video. Now if only Air Canada&#8217;s aeroplan site would only work with Safari!</p>

<p><em><strong>In other news&#8230;.</strong></em></p>
<p>In a curious twist, Apple released a knowledge base <a title="Anti-Virus" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2550?viewlocale=en_US" target="_blank">article</a> &#8217;encouraging&#8217; Mac users to begin to use Anti-Virus programs</p>
<p><em>so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent, thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult.</em></p>
<p><a title="AI virus opinion" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/12/01/apple_now_encourages_antivirus_use_for_mac_os_x.html" target="_blank">Appleinsider suggests</a> that this points to a softening of Apple&#8217;s opinion on this matter. My experience has been that Macs are fairly immune to most of the threats out there and that, although there are proof of concept viruses that <em>can</em> affect the platform there is nothing widespread out there. That being said, many of my clients communicate with Windows-based users and their machines can become carriers of a virus. If you are in this position it might be a good idea to heed Apple&#8217;s advice.</p>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE - 12-3-2008</em></strong></p>
<p>Apple just pulled their knowledge base note concerning the need for anti-virus software stating that the Mac OS is built to withstand such kinds of attacks. <a title="Anti-Anti Virus" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/12/03/apple_pulls_support_note_recommending_antivirus_software.html" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>

iMacs, MacBooks, Mini&#8217;s, MacPros - all these great machines with the best feline Operating System (Leopard) around and what do most people do - write email and surf the web! Okay, not everyone. What I do hear a lot is that we all have these wonderful computers, but we tend to either under-use them or not know how to fully utilize what have in our hands. </p>
<p>My job, which is my delight, is help people find solutions to the things they do everyday. There are a lot of great resources out there and I will be forthcoming with more. A great place to start is with Apple&#8217;s very own and very helpful <a title="Quick Tips Podcasts" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=257243321" target="_blank">Quick Tips Podcast</a>. When you click on this link iTunes will open and navigate to the proper place. There you will find 30 second videos that will demonstrate some of the basic and not so basic features you never knew you didn&#8217;t know (Rumsfeld anyone?). This is a great resource for beginners and old-hands alike.</p>
<p><a title="What is a Podcast?" href="http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/what-is-a-podcast.htm" target="_blank">What is a Podcast</a>? Think of a Podcast like a radio program - which is what it basically is. There are thousands of audio and video podcasts being made by both Professionals and non alike and they are available to you directly from within iTunes. Just click on the Podcast selection in the left-hand source menu, choose to view the Podcast Directory and be prepared to be amazed. What&#8217;s even better - most are FREE! You can listen on demand, subscribe to ones you like, sync them to your iPod or iPhone - did I mention they&#8217;re FREE?!</p>

<p>&#8220;But people who were hoping for a credible iPhone alternative fortified with BlackBerry&#8217;s strengths as a mobile tool for corporate travelers will likely find the Storm a disappointment. When it comes to touch interfaces, Apple still has no peer.&#8221; - <a title="PC World Storm Review" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/154212/blackberrys_storm_awkward_and_disappointing.html#" target="_blank">PC World&#8217;s Yardena Arar</a></p>
<p>And no WiFi!</p>
<p>The Blackberry Storm will be released today (Friday) and the <a title="Stormy Reviews" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/11/20/review_roundup_rims_new_touchscreen_blackberry_storm.html" target="_blank">first hands-on quick reviews</a> are out. They make for good and essential reading. I have already written a <a title="Technophile Storm Into" href="http://tech-no-phile.com/blog/?p=266" target="_blank">preliminary piece</a> on this device based on news around the web. Those of you who are gadget hungry and have been waiting for a touch screen Blackberry may be disappointed. Also be aware that the new Storm may not be able to sync to your Mac. At the moment, <a title="Pocket Mac" href="http://www.pocketmac.net/product.php?id=1" target="_blank">Pocket Mac</a>, whose sync software is licensed by RIM for use with the Mac OS, does not support the recently released <a title="BB Bold" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/145698/rims_blackberry_bold_beats_apple_to_the_3g_punch.html" target="_blank">Blackberry Bold</a> (however, <a title="Missing Sync" href="http://www.markspace.com/products/blackberry/blackberry-sync-mac-requirements.html" target="_blank">The Missing Sync</a> does and, it appears, the Storm). <a title="Promises" href="http://www.cio.com/article/449809/Mac_BlackBerry_Users_Rejoice_RIM_Promises_New_Mac_Tools_" target="_blank">RIM has promised</a> more Mac centric apps and tools from it in the first HALF of 2009!</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note 11-26-2008 - Read <a title="Storm Review NYTimes" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/technology/personaltech/27pogue.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology" target="_blank">David Pogue&#8217;s NY Times Review</a> of the Storm - the iPhone has nothing to worry about!</em></p>
<p><strong>In Other News</strong>:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be surprised if iPhone owners wake up to a new <a title="New 2.2 iPhone Firmware Features" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/topics/iPhone_Software_2.2.html" target="_blank">2.2 Firmware update</a>. iTunes 8 was just updated this evening to <a title="iTunes 8.0.2" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/11/20/apple_releases_itunes_8_0_2_ahead_of_iphone_software_2_2.html" target="_blank">version 8.0.2</a> in anticipation of the new firmware which will bring greater security, Google Maps street views, direct Podcast downloading (yeah!) and more to the evolving <a title="The Jesus Phone" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/08/3-weeks-until-the-iphone-goes-on-sale/" target="_blank">Jesus Phone</a>. If you do update your phone, please allow iTunes to make a backup. I also suggest you backup your iCal calendar and Address Book as outlined in my <a title="How To...back up iCal and Address Book" href="http://tech-no-phile.com/blog/?p=115" target="_blank">downloadable guide in the  How To&#8230;</a> section of this blog.</p>

<p>Last year I heard about an idea that really caught my attention - so much so that I participated with my support and money. That idea and now reality is <a title="One Laptop Per Child" href="http://laptop.org/en/" target="_blank">One Laptop Per Child</a> spearheaded by <a title="Nicholas Negroponte" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte" target="_blank">Nicholas Negroponte</a>. The program aims to provide laptops for the <a title="The Other 90%" href="http://other90.cooperhewitt.org/Design/one-laptop-per-child" target="_blank">other 90%</a> of us - the $100 laptop. What exactly is One Laptop Per Child about? It&#8217;s about the power of education. It&#8217;s mission statement is</p>
<p><em>&#8230;to create educational opportunities for the world&#8217;s poorest children by providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop with content and software designed for collaborative, joyful, self-empowered learning. When children have access to this type of tool they get engaged in their own education. They learn, share, create, and collaborate. They become connected to each other, to the world and to a brighter future.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.tech-no-phile.com/blog/uploads/1lpc5.jpg" alt="1laptopperchild" /></p>
<p>Since this is a blog about technology I can&#8217;t think of a better way to spread it&#8217;s potential than through programs of this kind. Last year the OLPC launched it&#8217;s <a title="Give One Get One" href="http://laptop.org/en/participate/give-one-get-one.shtml" target="_blank">Give One Get One</a> special which allows a supporter to both buy one and either get one for a child here in North America or themselves and/or donate both to the enterprise and this week began that campaign again.</p>
<p>The price is kept down by the scale of the program and the non-profit nature of the approach. I suggest watching <a title="TED" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/nicholas_negroponte_on_one_laptop_per_child.html" target="_blank">Nicholas Negroponte&#8217;s TED video</a> (a little dated from 2006, but the it&#8217;s all there) and the website to get a sense of the vision.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.tech-no-phile.com/blog/uploads/1lpc3.jpg" alt="1laptopperchild" /></p>
<p>Given the recent election of Barack Obama in the United States on the theme of change, here is a way to make a real difference in a child&#8217;s life, a community&#8217;s hope and humanity&#8217;s future generation(s):</p>
<p><em>Most of the nearly two billion children in the emerging world don’t have access to adequate education. The XO laptop is our answer to this crisis—and after nearly two years, we know it’s working. Almost everywhere the XO goes, school attendance increases dramatically as the children begin to open their minds and explore their own potential. One by one, a new generation is emerging with the power to change the world..</em><br />
 <br />
There are many worthy causes and good ideas vying for attention this time of year - this is my pitch for just one. <a title="More" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/olpc/" target="_blank">Check out this link</a> for more videos and pics and see how this incredible tool is making a difference.</p>

<p><em>“With the laptop we can say that our school is really elevated because the children are really learning more&#8230; They see themselves discovering things that they have never been doing before.” — Mrs. M., Galadima School, Abuja, Nigeria</em></p>

It seems storm analogies abound these days what with the world financial situation and it&#8217;s effects on Main Street and Wall Street (as well as Joe The Plumber and Henry The Hamster). So on the heels of the recent news that Apple was <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/The-NPD-Group-iPhone-3G/story.aspx?guid=%7B7DDDC6C0-37E3-4534-B2D1-5F1399EBDB04%7D" target="_blank">number 1 among US consumers</a> (are there any left?) in the 3rd quarter of 2008, ahead of the Motorola Razr, number 2, the now number 3 company - our very own home-grown RIM - is poised to finally release it&#8217;s own storm - the highly anticipated <a title="Blackberry Storm" href="http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrystorm/" target="_blank">Blackberry Storm</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone knew it was coming and it does look very impressive. The specs seem to have a lot going for it - a touch screen with a stylus (I&#8217;m not sure if that means you need a stylus or you can use a finger and/or a stylus), horizontal email typing (a hole in the iPhone filled by a few apps on the App Store), a 3.2 megapixal camera with video capture (nice) and more. The demo on Rim&#8217;s site shows a touch screen QWERTY keyboard, but it looks like one of those layouts with the dual letters on each key (now touch key) is being used in Vertical mode- I personally never liked this approach. The good news is that it has a normal key-letter separation configuration in the horizontal position.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.tech-no-phile.com/blog/uploads/bbstorm2.jpg" alt="bbstorm" /> <img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.tech-no-phile.com/blog/uploads/bbstorm3.jpg" alt="bbstorm" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure this will be a big seller although no price seems to have been set yet. Is this an iPhone killer? Absolutely not. Everyone is playing catch-up to the iPhone&#8217;s incredible interface and ease of use (with little success) and RIM is no exception. I&#8217;m sure the folks at Apple are well aware of what&#8217;s going on and much more is to come from the creative minds at Cupertino. The plot thickens.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.tech-no-phile.com/blog/uploads/iphone.jpg" alt="iPhone" /><br />
I&#8217;ve been receiving requests to write about different topics so today&#8217;s post is going to deal with iPhone battery life and how it relates to the current economic situation (the second part was my idea).</p>
<p>The iPhone, if not configured properly, will suck the energy from it&#8217;s battery much the same way the economy, having been left to its own devices as in the US (think, for example, the <a title="Credit Swaps" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap#Description" target="_blank">Credit Default Swap</a> debacle there), can suck all the wealth from the coffers. To conserve battery energy and our economy some kind of intervention is required. Apple has <a title="iPhone Battery Conservation Tips" href="http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html" target="_blank">posted their suggestions</a> on its website and another set of guidelines was pointed out to me on a site called <a title="CrazyGadgetGuru" href="http://www.crazygadgetguru.com/posts/2007/8/13/the-two-laws-of-iphone-battery-care.html" target="_blank">CrazyGadgetGuru </a>(aka Charles Gordon). I recommend checking out both of these links as they offer excellent tips for better battery care. </p>
<p>One of the more interesting points I discovered from the CrazyGadgetGuru was that lithium batteries (which are used in the iPhone and Apple&#8217;s laptops) are best conserved when kept in the middle of their capacity range. He also suggests not to top off the battery to 100% if it&#8217;s reading a high charge reading. Another tip is to avoid the 20% left warning as much as possible. His summary is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>80/20 Rule. Phone is never allowed to fall below 20% level, or charged higher than 80% of indicated capacity.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Frequent Charging. The phone is charged frequently in the middle of the capacity range, typically from 30% to 70%.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Phone is charged, stored, and operated as close to 60 degrees as possible</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Web surfing is done with phone resting on a cool marble slab (kidding). Lacking that, it is never stored in a pocket or with a case that has insulative properties.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these guidelines/interventions Mr. Gordon suggests one might expect 5 years out of the battery life (instead of the usual 2).</p>
<p>I have found keeping an iPhone car charger around very handy when I&#8217;m on the go as well. Apple&#8217;s suggestions of turning off the WiFi and/or 3G features to conserve battery life, although well-meaning, makes no sense to me as that defeats the main attractions of the device&#8217;s network strengths. Why would I want to primarily use my phone over the slower Edge network? If you don&#8217;t need to receive calls (eg. in a movie theatre, out for dinner, at an important event, you find yourself in a no cell zone etc&#8230;) I suggest putting the phone into Airplane mode - this will quickly turn off all the main features of the phone until you&#8217;re ready to use them again.</p>
<p>So, with a little oversight, user intervention and responsible care one can hope to nurture and promote both a healthy iPhone battery and a healthy economy : ) $$$$$</p>

Something a little off topic, but interesting: Apple has recently come out in <a title="No to Proposition 8" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/10/24/apple-publicly-opposes-california-proposition-8-ban-on-same-sex-marriage/" target="_blank">opposition to Proposition 8</a> that seeks to eliminate the right to same-sex marriage in the state of California. It&#8217;s put it&#8217;s money behind it&#8217;s stand as well - $100,000.</p>
<p><em>Apple is publicly opposing Proposition 8 and making a donation of $100,000 to the No on 8 campaign. Apple was among the first California companies to offer equal rights and benefits to our employees’ same-sex partners, and we strongly believe that a person’s fundamental rights — including the right to marry — should not be affected by their sexual orientation. Apple views this as a civil rights issue, rather than just a political issue, and is therefore speaking out publicly against Proposition 8.</em></p>
<p>The proposition will be on the California ballot on the November 4th vote.</p>
