			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0011UK2HE/metafilter-20 src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iphonecharger.jpg" alt="" title="iphonecharger" width="280" border="0" height="280" style="float:right;margin:10px;" /></a>I got a 3G iPhone as an impulse buy the other day (they&#8217;re plentiful in Oregon it seems, no lines, got one in ten minutes at 2pm on a Friday) but the big downside aside from the higher monthly cost was that my trusty old Belkin car adapter with pre-amp line out sound no longer charged the iPhone. The newest iPhone accepts power on the USB architecture instead of the old firewire one, so most every old car charger no longer charges your iPhone (and being the battery killer the 3G is, this is important to charge it as often as possible).</p>
<p>A bit of research the other day uncovered <a href="http://carljonard.com/2008/07/how-to-charge-your-iphone-3g-in-the-car/">this list of compatible car chargers</a> (with and without sound output) and I decided to bite the bullet and buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0011UK2HE/metafilter-20">the Kensington LiquidAUX car kit</a>. </p>
<p>After getting the package and setting it up, I have to say it does exactly what it should, charging the 3G iPhone and transmitting sound via the line out cord into my car&#8217;s aux-in jack. The extra cool bonus feature is that the wireless remote actually works on my iPhone, allowing me to now skip songs, pause playback, and toggle shuffle directly from my steering wheel without taking my eyes off the road. I really didn&#8217;t expect the wireless remote (with included steering mount) to function on an iPhone, but it does and it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>So high marks all around for this. If you have a new iPhone, and you want to charge/listen to your iPhone in the car, this Kensington option is a good one (there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0011UK2HO/metafilter-20">a $5 more expensive version</a> with a iPhone holder on a stalk that I didn&#8217;t need, but you might).</p>

<p>Holy cow. 24 hours ago, I took the stage at <a href="http://thestartconference.com/">the START conference</a> and explained some of the thinking and process behind me and pb&#8217;s new site <a href="http://www.fuelly.com/">Fuelly</a>. I knew it was an influential crowd, and I knew if it was good it might take off, but I thought maybe we&#8217;d hit 1,000 users by the end of the weekend at most. </p>
<p>Thanks mostly to twitter and other blogs (like <a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> and <a href="http://getrichslowly.org/blog/">Get Rich Slowly</a>) it&#8217;s grown a bit faster than we expected. A cable network is doing a piece on it. Various awesome iPhone developers are wanting to plug into the API we still need to build. It&#8217;s really been a crazy 24 hours.</p>
<p>Our inboxes are bursting with feature requests and bugs, but I&#8217;m really happy with how far we got building a site in just a few weeks. I&#8217;ll be posting a full story of the development and creation of the site on <a href="http://fortuito.us/">fortuito.us</a> in a week or two when all this dies down a little, hopefully inspiring other developers to try building their own similar projects.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to turn this entire site into an &#8220;apple sucks for the following reasons&#8230;&#8221; blog, but I expect more from them and feel that pointing out their faults and design decisions that go against their typical fine work is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m pissed at their iTunes Store DRM. I have two computers I use daily, an iPhone, and an AppleTV. All four devices allow me to buy things directly from the iTunes Store, but wherever you purchase a file, it stays. Sometimes when I&#8217;m traveling and I&#8217;m on my laptop but I wish I had a show I left on my desktop at home, I&#8217;ll break down and go to the iTunes Store to get another copy. When you do something like that, you get this screen:</p>
<div align="center"><a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-1.png'><img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-1-300x127.png" alt="" title="picture-1" width="300" height="127" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>The thing that is broken for me is that you can playback iTunes purchased files on up to 5 computers, which I&#8217;m currently using less than the maximum of. Apple knows I&#8217;ve purchased the audio/video file before, and they know how many devices have ever played back that purchased file, but instead of allowing me to re-download the file to another computer capable of playing it, I&#8217;m forced to purchase a second copy.</p>
<p>I know I can just FTP the audio/video file from one machine to the next but sometimes you forget to do that before you leave the house. Or, you buy a TV show on your AppleTV, and that syncs to one computer, but not the other.</p>
<p>I really wish Apple would allow at least a few extra chances to download purchased media files. I&#8217;ve lost hard drives and had backup drives die as well, and it sure would be nice if they could let you see your entire purchase history and let you get things back you might have lost, or get second copies for your other devices.</p>

Unfortunately, I spent the following two weeks mostly on family vacation down in San Diego. I did get a few rides in, but I forgot how slow city riding can be with all the stoplights blocking you. Overall, I finished the month with only 333 miles ridden due to the time off for travel. On the plus side, August is my last chance to cram in the miles and climbing to train for Cycle Oregon in September. I&#8217;m hoping to hit 600 miles in August.</p>
<p>On the diet front, I shed a couple pounds more but I think I&#8217;m going to finally stop drinking soda completely for a month to see how much it affects my weight.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently bought my dad a new 20&#8243; iMac and today I set it up for him. This has been a long time coming, going back at least three years that he has suffered under viruses and adware on Windows systems that would grind his computer to a halt. Up until now, he&#8217;s been replacing each system every 9-12 months with another $500 generic PC, but since each one used the same version of windows, the cycle would repeat.</p>
<p>His iMac is probably the sixth or seventh mac I&#8217;ve set up out of a box and the experience is great as always. I loaded the programs he used on his PC (almost everything was browser-based, and on firefox, so not too big of a change) and functional replacements were tossed into the dock (TextEdit instead of Notepad.exe, etc).</p>
<p>There was one big sticking point though. He is in his 60s and runs large fonts in Windows (<a href="http://www.wordstar.org/computing/pages/monitor_cal.htm">which is easy to change</a>) in order to see everything easily. I saw his PC boot up and figured no prob, we&#8217;ll just mimic it in Leopard since Apple has consistently been a forerunner in the Accessibility options.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s where things get surprising.</p>
<p>This is the System Preferences window:<br />
<img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-41-300x256.png" alt="" title="picture-41" width="300" height="256" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2914" /></p>
<p>So I tried out the Accessibility pane since that seemed the obvious place:<br />
<a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-61.png'><img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-61-300x271.png" alt="" title="picture-61" width="300" height="271" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2915" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This preference pane looks fantastic</strong> &#8212; large fonts, high contrast &#8212; perfect for what I need, but looking under the &#8220;Seeing&#8221; options, I don&#8217;t see anything except optional key modifiers to temporarily zoom the interface. Nothing about fonts, nothing about zooming without requiring some panning when zoomed in. I just want the entire OS to look like that pane, but I&#8217;m not seeing the option.</p>
<p>I go back to the all preferences and think &#8220;Appearance&#8221; must be it then. On a Windows box that&#8217;s where you see fonts show up so I bet it is there. Let&#8217;s look:<br />
<a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-51.png'><img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-51-300x250.png" alt="" title="picture-51" width="300" height="250" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2916" /></a></p>
<p>hmm. Nothing about fonts. I try the OS X help and there are no results for &#8220;large fonts&#8221;. I can&#8217;t believe there isn&#8217;t a simple option, so I google around. Any combination of &#8220;large fonts&#8221; and &#8220;os x&#8221; and &#8220;visibility&#8221; and &#8220;leopard&#8221; ends with thousands of links to articles about the utility FontBook. After a couple hours, I only came away with the suggestion that I set the fonts large in every single app my father might use, and if I wanted the Apple menubar along the top any more legible, there is some sort of <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080402181745803">plist xml hack</a> to bump things up in Finder, using an obscure program.</p>
<p>Did I miss something obvious somewhere? I asked several longtime mac using friends where one would change the entire system to 24 or 36pt fonts by default and everyone initially thought like I did, that it must be in the Accessibility preferences, but none of my friends could find it either.</p>
<p>This is one of the few times I have to say Windows has it right (and has had right for many years) &#8212; it is extremely easy to find a way to bump the entire OS to larger more legible fonts with just a couple clicks, but I&#8217;m not seeing it anywhere on a Mac running Leopard.</p>
<p>Did I miss something obvious?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had my original iPhone for over a year now, and I&#8217;ve had a pretty stable use pattern. I charge the phone often (every time I&#8217;m in a car (daily) and every other night attached to my computer) and rarely see the battery dip below maximum. For usage, I typcially use it for about 15 minutes of internet stuff in the morning, I&#8217;ll use it for about 10 minutes or so around lunch, and I&#8217;ll often go out for 60-90 minutes of daily exercise time using it as a music player. I probably make an average of only 3-5 calls on it a week, so it&#8217;s mostly an internet device to me, acting in place of a laptop whenever I&#8217;m outside of my house.</p>
<p>In the week since the launch of the 2.0 OS, I&#8217;ve loaded my iPhone up with about a dozen apps, but mostly I&#8217;ve just tested them out or played with them for five minutes and haven&#8217;t launched them a second time. The one app I surprisingly use (surprising because I&#8217;m not normally into games and not into cards/gambling at all) is the Texas Hold &#8216;em game. I&#8217;ve probably played it an hour a day since I got the iPhone 2.0 OS.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve noticed so far is that if I play a few hands in the game, then hit the sleep button at the top to throw the phone in my pocket or put it on a table to be ignored, when I come back my battery will be down to a half or less. It happened the other night when I played the game before bed. I woke up to a nearly dead iPhone on my nightstand. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird because I&#8217;ve never &#8220;exited&#8221; or &#8220;quit&#8221; iPhone&#8217;s native apps before and I&#8217;ve never had battery life issues. I often just hit the sleep button when I&#8217;m reading email or in the camera app, and the battery will be fine hours later. Yesterday I noticed I played some poker, hit the sleep button, went away for one hour, and my battery was half drained.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s a pain that Apple screens all the apps and I bet 3G and GPS are power drains on the new iPhone, but I have a feeling even the well-vetted apps are causing a lot of power consumption that wasn&#8217;t happening in the past. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll concede this is just a hunch and I may be wrong, but after a year of a constantly full battery under mild use, the only changes I&#8217;ve made in the past week were using one new app, and my battery is now getting drained much faster.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been getting some annoying robot phonecalls recently on a daily basis. They always give me menu options to hear more, but never an option to tell them they got the wrong number (or some guy put down the wrong number). The robot leaves messages with half of their recorded message so when I was deleting a slew of them today I noticed one sounded very different from the rest, so I took a quick recording of it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something almost melodic in how the robot says the name and the message is pretty amusing in the way it reads like the worst EULA ever and that part of it sounds like the Miranda Rights being read to you.</p>
<p>Here it is, enjoy:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to be speaking at <a href="http://www.bizjamseattle.com/">Bizjam Seattle</a> this Wednesday afternoon about my high road approach to blogging (eschewing SEO snake oil and not being an annoying person on every social network). Judging by the titles, I suspect half the talks will be preaching the opposite of what I&#8217;m planning to say, so it&#8217;ll either be a breath of fresh air in a sea of insanity for attendees, or it&#8217;ll go over like a lead balloon. Either way, it should be fun.</p>
<p>Here are my slides:</p>
<div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_506659"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=bizjam-1215636929136922-8"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=bizjam-1215636929136922-8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>

</div>
<p><strong>update</strong>: I gave the talk and it went over well. I added my notes for every slide to Slideshare. Click the &#8220;view&#8221; link above, then click on the &#8220;Comments on Slide 1&#8243; tab below the slides to see my notes. It should look like this when you click on it. Then, use the arrows to go from slide to slide and you can read my notes for what I talked about on each slide (since the slides themselves have very little info on them).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One last UI nitpick I&#8217;ve been meaning to write down for ages, and it goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re viewing recent photos/posts on a website and you want to read more, so you click the button at the bottom to give you a few more older entries</li>
<li>You view those photos/posts then scroll down to get more</li>
<li>Your choices are labeled &#8220;Previous&#8221; and &#8220;Next&#8221; or &#8220;Back&#8221; and &#8220;Next&#8221;</li>
<li>Which do you choose? Why?</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem as I see it is mostly a vocabulary one in the English language used to describe date-ordered output. Since I&#8217;m viewing <em>recent</em> content and I&#8217;m wanting to request <em>older</em> stuff, I tend to think of &#8220;Previous&#8221; and &#8220;Back&#8221; as representing the idea of &#8220;Older&#8221;. But most often the Back or Previous refers to the previous page you were on, which had Newer photos/post that you already viewed, so the &#8220;Next&#8221; option is used to fetch older entries. See how that&#8217;s cognitively backwards?</p>
<p>I saw this just hit me on flickr mobile (screenshot of page 2 of my photostream is shown below) and I&#8217;ve seen it on countless other blogs and web applications. I get tripped up on this several times a week.</p>
<p><a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-1.png'><img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-1.png" alt="flickr mobile" title="flickr mobile" width="239" height="681" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2900" /></a></p>
<p><strong>My proposed solution</strong></p>
<p>Never use the phrases Previous/Next or Back/Next that cause confusion in the first place for date-based output in your web application. Instead, explicitly make your labels for pagination say Older and Newer to make it abundantly clear to users. Here are some screenshots from MetaFilter, where I use it exclusively (and I always make Older point to the left, and Newer point to the right, which I&#8217;d say is optional but pick a consistent direction for both and stick with it throughout your webapp).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cycling is going really well since the weather is nice. I rode 398 miles (just shy of my target 400-500 per month this summer) in June and I did quite a bit of hill climbing work, with over 20,000 feet climbed for the month (the month previous was about half that). </p>
<p>Diet-wise, I sort of hit a wall, recording the same weight at the previous two or three months. I exercised my ass off in June but I also ate like a horse so I&#8217;m spending the first week of July really watching what I eat and cutting out a few more things that are probably keeping my weight steady.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Threadless is my favorite place to buy t-shirts, period (this includes any offline stores). I&#8217;ve bought dozens and dozens of them and I even subscribed to the shirt of the month club for a year, but every time I make the mistake of throwing a few shirts in my virtual cart and then remembering to login afterwards, I lose all my previous selections. I buy shirts there every couple months and in between each visit I often forget about this bug in the long lost hopes someone fixes it. When I got hit with it for the millionth time tonight, I took a few quick screen captures to demonstrate the problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.metafilter.com/threadlessfail.mov">Here is video of the shopping cart failure</a></p>
<p>The first 30 second bit is me adding a shirt to my cart, continuing to shop, then logging in and trying to check out, but my cart turns up empty. Not good.</p>
<p>The second shorter bit is after I add a shirt to my cart, go to check out, then remember I should login to grab my saved address/credit card/etc info, but as you can see it clears out the cart. Oftentimes I lose 15 minutes of shopping time picking out just the right shirts in my size because the cart clears out every time upon login. Then I have to try and remember all the designs I liked and put them back in the cart (often I just quit and shop the next time they send me a &#8216;new releases&#8217; email)</p>
<p>Threadless, I love you guys to death but I&#8217;ve encountered this bug for about two years and would love love love it if you fixed it with some cookie/session storage of shirt selections so I don&#8217;t lose my cart upon login </p>
<p>(why login? if you don&#8217;t login, it basically creates a new threadless account with your exact same details and there was a time I was subscribed to their mailing list three times under different &#8220;accounts&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>: by the power of greyskull, this has been fixed!</p>

<p>My cousin <a href="http://tikitony.com/">Tony</a> and his girlfriend got married this past weekend and as a young couple in Southern California, they&#8217;ve been saving for years for their first house. On the occasion of their marriage, they didn&#8217;t want to fill a non-existent house with blenders and trinkets but didn&#8217;t want to flatly refuse gifts since weddings tend to be a place where people like to help out new couples by giving them gifts, but I think they felt weird asking for money towards a new home purchase.</p>
<p>So they came up with a pretty cool idea. He&#8217;s an artist and she&#8217;s a writer, and together they collected a bunch of paintings, ceramics, photos, and drawings and put them up for silent auction for several hours before and after the ceremony. Everything I liked had bids into the hundreds of dollars and all told, I bet they raised a couple grand in the process of letting family buy some pretty cool works of art.</p>
<p>I hope my other artist friends and family do this in the future, because I thought it was a pretty cool idea.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After upgrading my first mac (powerbook) to another powerbook, then to an iMac and finally to a Mac Pro, I realized five years of using the <a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/tips/migration.html">Migration Assistant</a> had finally run its course. Various basic parts (mostly Keychain Access) of Leopard stopped functioning properly and since everything ran great on my new Macbook Air, I decided it was time to backup, format, and reinstall fresh on my main Mac Pro. </p>
<p>A few hours after upgrading I installed Firefox and my most often used apps like Transmit and Textmate. Every few days I realized I needed one more app so I&#8217;d download and install it. After a week or so, I was pretty much done reinstalling. </p>
<p><a href="http://fortuito.us/2007/04/living_online_with_web_apps">Last year I wrote about</a> doing as much as possible using online apps and how I found it really handy, so today I looked at my Applications folder to see how many things I&#8217;ve installed aside from the default Mac apps. I counted 11 applications total outside of iLife and iWork. It includes a couple proprietary things I need for installed hardware (like the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000WJCX18/metafilter-20">ScanSnap</a>) but it&#8217;s mostly the basics (Firefox, Transmit, etc) for doing my everyday work tending MetaFilter.</p>
<p>The thing that surprises me is that I reformatted my computer about six weeks ago, and I haven&#8217;t felt like anything is missing since. Thanks to a combination of almost all my work being done online and the great set of built-in functionality of OSX, I can get by on an almost completely clean system.</p>
<p>Ten years ago I had literally hundreds of apps on my Windows box, and I feel like I was constantly needing more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I buy a lot of stuff online, so I get a lot of emails alerting me that my items have shipped, and here is a handy tracking number to follow their progress to me. Sounds great and super useful.</p>
<p><img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-4.png" alt="" title="ups" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2891" /></p>
<p>The problem is, if you click on the tracking number soon after you receive an email notification about it, your first impression is one of failure. For the first several hours, you usually get an error that tracking info can&#8217;t be found yet for that number. Later that day, it will usually update to &#8220;electronic billing information received&#8221; which tells you one computer at the retailer talked to another computer at the shipment company, but not much else. Several (unknown number, you have to guess) days later, the tracking info showing destinations left and the highly coveted &#8220;OUT FOR DELIVERY&#8221; status appears.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a person that responds pretty fast to email and I keep a fairly short window for things sitting in my inbox (typically less than a day, so it&#8217;s zero at the end of the day), so that first day, tracking number emails are essentially useless. When they do have useful data several days later, it requires a search of my archived mail to turn them up and I have to remember to check on the packages days later.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, tracking info for the shipment of packages is a great and useful thing, but the user experience of the first time you click on a tracking number link is almost always a disappointment. Is there anything we can do to make the first impression of tracking numbers a useful one?</p>

The weather improved to the point where I could ride pretty much any day I wanted to, taking my monthly mileage up to 333 miles (last month was a paltry 185). I surpassed the first of my goals for the year, which was to ride 1,000 miles in a year. For the last few years I&#8217;ve ridden just 600-800 miles over each summer, but never consistently rode enough to pass a thousand. It looks like I&#8217;ll be in the 2,000-3,000 mile range for the year if I continue riding as much as I have. </p>
<p>I also did my first big ride of the year, a leisurely 54 mile ride from a nearby town to the ocean. I&#8217;m feeling a lot stronger on my training rides and will be upping my mileage to at least 400-500 miles per month for the rest of the summer as I get ready for the 500 mile week at the start of September for Cycle Oregon. I&#8217;m planning on racing a bit as well, with some <a href="http://www.racemondaynight.com/blog/">PIR races</a> and <a href="http://www.portlandracing.com/">Short Track</a> later this month.</p>
<p>On the diet front, I&#8217;m still at the same weight that I was last month, but I did gain and lose several pounds in the middle there, so my weight loss of 10lbs at the beginning of the year is fairly stable (though I&#8217;d still like to keep going and lose 25 more). As I up my mileage this summer and eat more fresh foods, I suspect I&#8217;ll come down another 10lbs by mid-summer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing my massaged Trek Lime. It went from this:<br />
<a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/lime_angle_1.jpg'><img src="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/lime_angle_1.jpg" alt="" title="lime_angle_1" width="287" height="294" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2886" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>(<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mathowie/sets/72157605406140451/detail/">full photo set</a>)</p>
<p>Using extra parts from old bikes and a bit of ebay, I did the following to improve the look of my Lime: removed rubber colorways (too iMac 1998 looking), added <a href="http://cetmaracks.com/">CETMA rack</a> front and generic rack in the back, made custom slats for both racks using 1/8&#8243; mahogany plywood which I clear coated, added a flask and holder, threw crank bros 50/50 pedals on, swapped out stock seat and post for an old carbon post and Brooks B17 saddle, threw on Nitto moustache bars with matching Brooks tape, and took off the stock 2 inch wide tires for 1.4 inch Ritchey slicks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed my Trek Lime since I bought it last summer (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/technology/10bike.html?_r=1&#038;scp=4&#038;sq=%22by+Matthew+Haughey%22&#038;st=nyt&#038;oref=slogin">I reviewed it for the NYT</a>), but I wasn&#8217;t always happy with the look of it. After I attended the North American Handmade Bike Show in Portland (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathowie/sets/72157603884083374/">my photos</a>), I considered building up a fixie or creating a frankenbike using an old track frame and bits of the Trek Lime to get gears and braking without any cable clutter. I&#8217;ve always loved the clean look of a fixie without its cables, brakes, or shifters, but I didn&#8217;t want to lose the utility/easy riding of having gears and a brake. </p>
<p>I loved the city bike designs (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goligorsky/2281174010/">like this one</a>) from the bike show: nice useful racks, tasteful materials and details, and overall easy to ride bikes. So I rummaged through my garage, bought some parts on eBay and starting dismantling and re-assembling my Trek Lime into something better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with the results, it still rides easy, the bars are very comfortable, I can toss tons of stuff on the front and rear racks, and it has the clean cable-free look I was after.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2008/05/09/stop-asking-start-filtering/">my previous post</a> and <a href="http://prspammers.pbwiki.com/">Gina&#8217;s PR blacklist</a> that sprang from it, it seems like a good chunk of the PR industry is <a href="http://technorati.com/search/http%3A%2F%2Fprspammers.pbwiki.com%2F">blogging about the things they should and shouldn&#8217;t be doing</a>, but I&#8217;m not seeing a lot of practical real-world solutions that would work for bloggers getting pitched. All the advice has come from the PR side of things so it&#8217;s all about how they train employees, how they do their work, and why their work is vital to bloggers (newsflash: it often isn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>So in the spirit of extending an olive branch to the PR industry, here are some very basic tips I haven&#8217;t seen anyone mention elsewhere:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Don&#8217;t ever send a press release to a blogger based on a purchased list</strong><br />
I keep hearing about this thing called <a href="http://us.cision.com/products_services/cisionpoint/plan/media_database/media_database_overview.asp">the Bacon/Cision list</a> and how all the bloggers complaining about getting spammed are on it (the idea of someone selling a list with my email on it is another matter). As many PR people have stated, connecting PR and bloggers should be a connection made via reading their blog and contacting them with a personal note at the very least. Adding 200 names to a bcc: list on an emailed press release because you got 200 blogger emails from some list is the absolutely wrong way to go about it. Don&#8217;t <em>ever</em> do this.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Go beyond the press release</strong><br />
The rare, few times I&#8217;ve felt like enduring all this PR hassle was worth it was when someone from a company contacted me with an invite to preview a product, try out a site, and/or obtain a review item. A press release is the thing I line the bird cage with, a review unit is something I can actually use for a week or two and get a full review story written ready to publish on the day your client launches the product. I can&#8217;t stress it enough that a press release sent to me is just plain noise and totally and completely useless. Or if you must, at least just send me a link to one in case I want to learn more about the news you are sharing instead of pasting 2,000 words in ALL CAPS into an email.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Introduce a feedback loop!</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve <em>never</em> been contacted by anyone in PR that bothered to follow-up with me at any point in our &#8220;relationship&#8221;. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathowie/2479675760/sizes/o/">I just get a bunch of press releases emailed to me</a> again and again, often by the same people. If you&#8217;ve hand-picked out some bloggers covering topics you have clients releasing news about, at least check with the bloggers after a month, or your second message, or some other regular interval. Ask them if the PR they&#8217;ve been receiving is helpful and if it should be tweaked, or even ended if it&#8217;s not useful.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Provide an unsubscribe link</strong><br />
This is totally bottom-of-the-barrel, least-you-can-do-to-appease-bloggers stuff here, but at the very least provide an instant, no-humans-required way for a blogger to remove themselves from contact they aren&#8217;t getting anything but frustration from. About 1/4 of the PR email I get is managed with some sort of list interface and provides this option, and I use the option when off-topic, all-caps press releases get blasted my way. I prefer a no-humans-required option because I&#8217;ve asked people at an agency to remove me and they said they had and sorry for the inconvenience, only to be emailed by the same person two weeks later.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Use metrics to help you do your PR job</strong><br />
If personally emailing a bunch of bloggers with personal messages sounds like a lot of work that doesn&#8217;t scale, try using metrics to help you figure out what works and doesn&#8217;t. Right now we have the annual &#8220;did my PR firm show up on a blacklist?&#8221; metric, but if you implement the suggestions above, keep tabs on what percentage of receivers clicked on a link to read a press release (are your press releases effectively written?), figure out what % click on an unsubscribe link (how effective are you targeting bloggers), figure out how often the bloggers you contact ever write about your clients (how effective your PR/blogger strategy is) and when they do was it because of a press release or did you give them something more (to figure out if newer non-traditional approaches are working better). </p>
<p><strong>update</strong>: Just to be clear here, I&#8217;m not asking for bloggers to be treated differently than journalists in other media because we bloggers are a cranky lot that can harm your company with a snide blog post if you do things wrong &#8212; my point in treating bloggers differently is that bloggers can often publish perfectly informative, up-to-date blogs without PR, instead relying on RSS, other blogs, Google News, and link aggregators to find news about topics they are interested in.</p>
<p>I published multiple blogs for five years before I got my first unsolicited press release, and if PR people want to stay relevant, they need to acknowledge that bloggers work in an information-rich environment filled with millions of choices and as a PR person you really need to be adding some value to their approach instead of taking time away with off-topic press releases emailed to them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://images.metafilter.com/prfilter.png" alt="PR filters" style="float:right;margin:10px;" /> I know it&#8217;s a clichÃ© as a blogger to <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/10/sorry-pr-people.html">complain about public relations flacks</a> sending you giant PDFs and weekly emails on topics you don&#8217;t care about, but recently I noticed my tried and true polite email saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please remove my email address from your PR lists. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Matt</p></blockquote>
<p>totally stopped working. Turns out that a lot of these PR companies have a single database of random blogger emails they&#8217;ve snarfed up, but each employee seems to maintain their own personal list. When I ask Alice at example.com PR to remove me, I noticed a week later I got another PR blast from Bob at example.com PR. Then Steve at example.com PR hits me again a day later.</p>
<p>So for now, I&#8217;m moving to filters in Gmail. The entire PR agency domain goes into the From: and you set it to delete immediately. Instantly, no more PR spam from Alice, Bob, or Steve, forever, and I don&#8217;t have to ask to opt-out of something I never opted into.</p>
<p>And to people working in PR, some bloggers do seem to post the things you send, but in four years of daily PR email blasts that now number in the thousands, I recall one or two being something I was actually interested in. That&#8217;s about the same success ratio of general email spam over the past 10 years for me.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>: I was thinking of posting my own blacklist of annoying firms, but it looks like Gina from Lifehacker <a href="http://prspammers.pbwiki.com/">beat me to the punch</a>.</p>
<p>And to PR folks reading this post, I left a comment describing my dream scenario for how PR people should interact with bloggers:</p>
<blockquote><p>the perfect PR person would match me up with topics I write about and when they figure out a perfect product pitch I might be interested in, email me personally once to share it, and ask me for confirmation if Iâd like to get future email from them. Unless I reply back with a &#8220;yes&#8221; don&#8217;t add me to a list or pitch me again &#8212; it&#8217;s a not a good match and is only going to build frustration on my end if you keep sending unsolicited pitches.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Another update</strong>: I&#8217;ve written some tips on <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2008/05/11/dear-pr-people-how-to-pitch-bloggers/">How To Pitch PR to Bloggers</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathowie/2442029582/" title="GEL by mathowie, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2288/2442029582_04e185d6cb_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="GEL" style="float:right;margin:10px;border:none;" /></a> Last week, I attended my third <a href="http://www.gelconference.com/">GEL conference</a> in New York City. Like previous versions of this conference, it&#8217;s a day of talks from speakers that have a variety of stories to tell about &#8220;good experiences.&#8221; The diversity of the speakers&#8217; backgrounds is the strength of the conference and this year didn&#8217;t disappoint. In a world of technology conferences that feature the same five subjects talked about by the same dozen people, I look forward to GEL every year to hear from health care workers, artists, restauranteurs, musicians, and yes, technologists.</p>
<p>A few years back, the conference split into two days where day one is an experience or tour and day two are standard talks given in an auditorium. Last year I had a blast touring MoMA and learning to juggle pins, this year I had a great time doing a Central Park soundwalk (<a href="http://www.onfocus.com/home.asp">pb describes it here in his GEL recap</a>). The walk was great, you basically blindfold yourself, grab a rope, and start shuffling around for about 20 minutes. If you&#8217;ve never tried anything like this before, I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. The first few minutes are pure anxiety bordering on panic but eventually you get used to the shuffling feet and with your eyes firmly shut for an extended period, your hearing takes over. I was blown away by the variety of birds in Central Park and sounds of people and music that accompanied our walk. The biggest surprise for me was finding that my brain tried to start &#8220;mapping&#8221; sound as we walked &#8212; I remember hearing strollers rolling towards me or birds growing near and in my mind I was placing them in a virtual canvas so I knew where they were headed and when I could expect to pass them. </p>
<p>After the blindfold walk, we sat and talked about what we heard and experienced, then we walked and stopped at various locations in the park to enjoy sound (with our eyes closed) from a single location. The mind-blowing moment during this section happened when I was sitting next to a walking path just outside of both a softball game and a merry-go-round. As people walked past and balls were hit, I heard some light foot padding and instantly recognized it as a dog going past. The first thought that sprang into my head was &#8220;that is the sound of a small, light dog&#8221; and surprised at the thought, I opened my eyes to see a little poodle trotting past. Now, I don&#8217;t know if I figured that out by chance or if my brain has a database of various dog sounds by weight I wasn&#8217;t aware of, but being in that place and state of mind was a wonderful exercise in getting reacquainted with my sense of hearing. The other highlight was walking to the center of the park and being in a spot in Manhattan where I could see no buildings of any kind, I was completely surrounded by natural things like trees and grass, and I could barely hear any sounds from the city. I didn&#8217;t know a place like that existed in NYC.</p>
<p>The day of talks went well and the subject matter and style is a lot like the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> conference. The best talks were both entertaining and enlightening and even if I had to classify a few talks as less than superb, I at least learned something about an industry I didn&#8217;t know anything about. In past years of GEL, I&#8217;ve remembered a few break out amazing talks that stuck with me for weeks and a few horrible stinkers that had me looking at my watch. This year&#8217;s talks had a few memorable points but no single talk stood out as truly amazing but on the positive side I don&#8217;t recall wanting any talk to end early. </p>
<p>If you attend a lot of technology conferences and you&#8217;re growing tired of hearing the same old thing, try out the GEL conference &#8212; sometimes it&#8217;s hit and miss and all over the map, but it&#8217;s always a good time in a wonderful city.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick monthly guilt-trip for myself: Thanks to a week of travel and a bout of sickness, I only covered 185.59 miles in April and my weight hovered around the same as last month. On the positive side, I did just break 800 miles for the year (normally a year-long amount of riding) and I&#8217;m on track to do about 2,500-3,000 miles for the year if I keep it up. Also, since it&#8217;s finally May in Oregon, the sun has decided to come out and grace us with good riding weather. I suspect I&#8217;ll start going from an average of 70 miles a week ridden to 100-120 mile weeks by June.</p>

		<description>Here in Portland, Maine there are plenty of people still using derailleurs, but very few people wear helmets. The only consistently helmeted group are the road bikers/spandex pod people; when a man wearing skintight pants is behaving more sensibly than you perhaps it&amp;#8217;s time for some self-reflection.
