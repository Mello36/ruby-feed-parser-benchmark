Its hard to find furniture that can throw back to the 60s while maintaining a polished, contemporary and sophisticated feel - but this chair does just that.  With its sleek smooth curve extending from the back to the seat, there is nothing that jars or shocks, either in its appearance or its comfort.  A modern touch is added to the comforting wooden finish by stabilizing the chair on a chrome plated frame.  The circular cutout is just unique enough without being too bizarre, and creates the retro vibe that the OFFI Skool Chair emanates.  You can find this chair in oak, walnut, birch, black or white finish.  <a href="http://www.designpublic.com/shop/offi/3333">Design Public</a> has these in stock for $189 each, and you might want to get more than one.  They would be perfect as dining room chairs or accent living room furniture.</p>
