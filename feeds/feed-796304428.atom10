		<description>It's a shame these crystal &lt;a href="http://www.usb-computer-speakers.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;USB bus powered computer speakers&lt;/a&gt; aren't a bit better designed. It's a bit clunky use Analog 1/8" audio jacks going into a separate USB analog to digital converter sound stick - rather than just have a single USB cable for digital audio and power.</description>

First off, thanks for stopping by and leaving a comment.
Honestly, that was my first reaction as well - but that doesn't stop Dell from trying, does it ? There's no word of a 'camera' in the Dell MP3 player
From my point of view, they're not going to succeed to gain enough market share to survive.</description>

		<description>Fail, I don't want another MP3 player, I've already got one right here that works perfectly fine.

And.. that's not a camera, is it? Fail.</description>

You might be right regarding the building, as for the keyword, it's just a concept as the title says. 
I agree that for some it might be uncomfortable to type on a hard surface, but the "magic" lies in the fact it can be projected almost anywhere.</description>

		<description>The glass keyboard is a horrible idea.  Aside from the complete lack of tactile response, typing on a hard object is actually really hard on the hands and will result in a ton of wrist injuries such as carpel tunnel or tendonitis.  

Also, how will the building be wired?  There has to be an elevator shaft, electricity, and sewage supplied to each of those levels and a central structure around the elevator shaft makes the most sense.</description>
