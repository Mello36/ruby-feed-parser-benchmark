			<title><![CDATA[ The death of CNET's media-conquering dreams ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/cbs-cnet.jpg" width="200" height="200" />CBS is <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20081211/confirmed-cbs-interactive-restructuring-after-cnet-deal-cutting-staff/">laying people off at CNET</a> &mdash; no surprise, since the entire media business is fitfully contracting, and after a merger, cuts are a given. But it signals the end of CNET's grandiose ambitions.</p> <p>When Halsey Minor, the ultraopinionated entrepreneur better known these days for his lawsuits than his business skills, launched CNET in the early '90s, he first had his eye on television. CNET's first website didn't come along until 1995. And he <a href="http://igoldrush.com/feat2.htm">snapped up domain names like mad</a>, names which all but spelled out his ambitions &mdash; TV.com, Radio.com, News.com. (Apocryphally, he's said to have bought the latter from News Corp., in a deal Rupert Murdoch must still regret.)</p> <p>CNET went public in 1996, and its market cap peaked at $12 billion before the dotcom bubble burst. At one point, it flirted with NBC, going into a joint-venture deal to create NBCi, a now-forgotten Web portal. At the time, some pundits imagined CNET and NBC combining &mdash; with CNET on top.</p> <p>Since then, it's been a long slide down. Minor left not long after the bubble popped. When CBS bought CNET this spring, the price was $1.8 billion. (CBS CEO Les Moonves recently said that while he "loves the deal," he wouldn't buy CNET again today at that same price.) CNET executives got roles within CBS Interactive, the new division formed by combining CBS's websites with CNET's &mdash; but there was no question who was in charge.</p> <p>That's become clearer now, with the layoffs. The newsrooms for CBSNews.com and CNET News are said to be combining; CBS is trimming back TV.com, MP3.com, and GameSpot, CNET's entertainment properties. Which makes sense: Why run mainstream news and entertainment coverage out of a backwater like San Francisco, when it can be done properly from New York and L.A.? There's logic to the move, but also a certain sadness, knowing that a fantasy of transforming the media business &mdash; a business in much need of transformation &mdash; has faded for good.</p> <p><em>(Logo mashup by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mager/">Andrew Mager</a>)</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ An instant history of Yahoo ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/yahoohistory.jpg" width="494" height="494" style="display:block;" />With 1,500 employees gone today, Yahoo has surely hit bottom. The company's third act begins today &mdash; either an amazing rebirth, a disappearance into Microsoft, or a slow grind into irrelevance. How did those become its options?</p> <p>Yahoo turns 15 next month. The site first went live, on a Stanford Unversity server, in January 1994. The years since fall neatly into two halves: the first, its dizzying rise from a campus trailer to $100 billion goliath; the second, its equally stupefying fall. Here's a recap of the past decade and a half.<br clear="all"></p> <p><strong>1994</strong><br> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/yahoo1994.png" width="490" height="420" style="display:block;"><br clear="all"> <br> Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo create Jerry's Guide to the Web, a directory of links to websites, in January.

			<title><![CDATA[ Jerry Yang's incompetent layoff memo ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228936890971_jerryyang-788359.jpg" width="340" height="228" />Yahoo has a <a href="http://">strict set of rules</a> to follow in layoffs: No small talk. Get to the point. Don't own the employee's feelings. Did Jerry Yang, the stumbling Internet company's cloddish founder-CEO, follow them in his latest all-hands memo?</p> <p>Of course not! Check out the unnecessary verbiage &mdash; all lowercase letters, as is Yang's too-lazy-for-the-shift-key wont &mdash; and the presumptuous empathizing, as Yang sends out a memo about the company's mass layoff of 1,500 employees. Is it any wonder that Yahoo's board has decided to fire Yang, too? He assumes its a "tough time" for all of his charges. It has never occurred to him that many Yahoos might cheer the company's shedding of deadwood &mdash; Yang included. </p> <p>The memo:<br /> <blockquote>yahoos,</p> <p>today, most of our layoffs in the US are happening, and they've been underway in other regions around the world. </p> <p>this is a tough time for all of us and i wanted to take a moment to reach out to you.</p> <p>saying goodbye to colleagues and friends is never easy. they all are dedicated members of our yahoo! family, who worked beside us and shared our passion. </p> <p>but as you all know, we must take actions to better perform in today's turbulent global economy. while we've found efficiencies in many parts of our business, laying off employees is unfortunately unavoidable. our difficult decision to let colleagues go reflects the changes we're having to make to better align costs with revenues - something businesses in virtually every sector are also having to do. </p> <p>for those who are affected by these layoffs, i am extremely grateful for your contributions to yahoo!. we realize the impact this will have on you. that's why, consistent with our past practices, we're making every effort to support you with severance packages and other services. </p> <p>the reductions we're making are very hard, but they are also very necessary - as we focus on the long-term health of our business. to those who are leaving us, i extend my heartfelt thanks on behalf of yahoos everywhere - you will be missed.</p> <p>thanks,<br /> jerry</p></blockquote> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ The long goodbye ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/adios.jpg" width="800" height="599" style="display:block;float:none;" />Everything takes forever at Yahoo, the once high-flying, now famously sluggish Internet giant. Today's layoffs of 1,500 employees have been expected for months. And yet the strange thing is so many Yahoos seem unprepared.</p> <p>Take this poignant goodbye message scrawled on a whiteboard. It speaks to a culture frozen in time &mdash; both the hang-loose Northern Californian waverider, and the frantic Web addict, reloading page after page over a 56-kbps modem. (Yahoo, in its early days, employed a large team of "surfers" who were paid to find new websites and add them to its directory.)</p> <p>On Twitter and blogs, a fragmentary picture of Yahoo's agonizing cut &mdash; 10 percent of its workforce &mdash; is emerging. Already we've heard of entire offices closing, like Right Media, the New York online-advertising startup Yahoo bougth for $680 million just last year, and Yahoo Brickhouse, the San Francisco-based incubator launched with such high hopes for spinning out new websites. Nothing memorable has issued from the Brickhouse, and real-estate agents have tromped through, suggesting the office in San Francisco's South Park neighborhood, the historic epicenter of the '90s dotcom wave, is being unloaded.</p> <p>Even Flickr, once Yahoo's golden child, is feeling pain, with employees being axed and runaway spending on servers and bandwidth being reined in.</p> <p>What else have you heard? If you work at Yahoo, or know someone who does, <a href="mailto:tips@valleywag.com">share your stories and pictures from the day</a>. We'll publish the best later.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Yahoo's secret layoff doublespeak revealed! ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/yahoolayoffs.jpg" width="525" height="301" style="display:block;" />Yahoo isn't firing people en masse &mdash; it's "getting fit." That noisome euphemism for today's layoffs of 1,500 people must have hissed forth from the brain of some overpaid management consultant. Likewise for pages upon pages of instructions on how to sack employees &mdash; which Valleywag has obtained.</p> <p>Thousands of Yahoo employees have been waiting months to find out if they're <a href="Yahoo%20http://valleywag.com/5106029/a-guide-to-yahoos-mass-layoff">going to be laid off</a>. Today they'll know for sure when their managers say the magic words.</p> <p>Yahoo's script for performing the layoff begins when the boss walks up to an employee getting the sack. And then he says, "Thank you, [FIRST NAME HERE], for coming in. I have some information regarding our organization I'd like to tell you in person." The anodyne managementspeak just gets worse from there: "I appreciate what you have done for Yahoo."</p> <p>We don't think Yahoo's layoff procedures are worse than any other big corporation's. Instead, they're depressingly ordinary for a company which once promised to reinvent the media business. Here's how the doomed will find out they no longer Yahoo:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/Slide-9.jpg" width="1141" height="846"><br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/Slide-11.jpg" width="1139" height="855"><br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/Slide-12.jpg" width="1140" height="855"><br clear="all"></p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/34/2008/12/Slide-19a.jpg" class="center image1024" width="1024"><br clear="all"></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ A guide to Yahoo's mass layoff ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/sadhoo_01.jpg" width="170" height="170" />Yahoo hasn't been able to do anything right lately. Why should Wednesday's job cuts be any different?</p> <p>Mass layoffs are always traumatic. But Yahoo's human-resources department is not approaching this with any particular grace.</p> <p>December 10 has long been rumored as the date for the layoffs. (We <a href="http://valleywag.com/5064258/yahoo-to-cut-3500-jobs-++-party-on">first heard in October</a>.) Nevertheless, some Yahoo employees were in the dark &mdash; until they logged on to the Yahoo intranet and noticed that the HR department had booked every single conference room at the company's Sunnyvale, Calif. headquarters. Others are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2008/12/09/yahoo-layoffs-workers-tech-ebiz-cx_bc_1209yahoo.html">hoping to be laid off</a>, figuring anything's better than Yahoo.</p> <p><strong>How the layoffs will go down:</strong> Commenter yanged <a href="http://valleywag.com/5104604/yahoos-last-hurrah#c9343263">describes the process</a>:<br /> <blockquote>There are requests for the little people to be in the office by 9 a.m. If they can't, they must be available by cell for the next 6 hours. Nobody sure what that all means. Are people going to get in early, pretend to do work all day, hoping not to get that knock on the door or phone call from the manager? After waiting for months, are people going to have to sweat it for hours and hours waiting to see if they will be tossed overboard?</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Who will get the ax:</strong> No one's safe. Upper management at the company insisted that departments across the board make personnel cuts. But finance will be hard hit; a source inside that group says 50 percent of the workforce could go. Likewise HR, since fewer employees require fewer administrators. Kara Swisher, the AllThingsD blogger, <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081208/yahoo-moves-ahead-with-layoffs-on-wednesday-the-details/">thinks entire projects might be eliminated</a>. Yahoo currently lists <a href="http://everything.yahoo.com/">more than 100 websites and services</a>. Does it really need Yahoo Pets, Yahoo Avatars, Yahoo Ecards? Let me put it this way: If it's a Yahoo site you've never heard of, it may well be on the chopping block.</p> <p><strong>Will this fix Yahoo?</strong> No. Sadly, Yahoo needs to fire another 2,000 people or so to get to a sensible size. If only outgoing CEO Jerry Yang, the indecisive blitherer, had made some hard decisions in his first 100 days on the job, like he promised to do last summer, these Yahoos might not be having to find new jobs in the worst recession in living memory.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Google lines up for a government handout ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/obamagoogle.png" width="476" height="284" style="display:block;" />In <em>The Audacity of Hope,</em> Barack Obama called his 2004 visit to the Googleplex the "most memorable part" of a trip to California. Google's salespeople are planning to make sure he doesn't forget it.</p> <p>Google already has an office in Washington, D.C., where its lobbyists cool their heels. But today, the overgrown search engine <a href="http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2008/12/google_unveils_reston_va_feder.php">opened up a 30-Googler outpost</a> in the part of town where the real money is made &mdash; Reston, Va., part of the string of office parks which runs from the Potomac to Dulles International, home to an endless number of government contractors.</p> <p>The federal government has jumped on the outsourcing trend, and hands out contracts left and right to outfits which do work so government employees don't have to. Google's hoping to score some of that cash. It doesn't have much to offer: custom website search tools, Google Maps, and Web-based email and office apps are about it. None of them have proven to be big moneymakers for Google.</p> <p>Not that it matters! Just having an office in the area to act as a cash bucket is all Google needs to do. Our president-to-be has long had a mancrush on Google. Besides writing it up in his book, Obama modeled his campaign operations after Google, chose the Googleplex as the site where he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4yVlPqeZwo">unveiled his "innovation agenda,"</a> and appointed Google CEO Eric Schmidt to a council of economic advisors. When Obama unveils his Works Progress Administration 2.0, you know Larry and Sergey will somehow get a piece. Why not? Google seems to get a cut of all the rest of the action.</p> <p>Here's a clip of Obama at Google in 2007:</p> <p><object width="506" height="417" class="left"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/m4yVlPqeZwo&hl=en&fs=1"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/m4yVlPqeZwo&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="506" height="417" class="left"></object><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/m4yVlPqeZwo_01.jpg" style="display: none;" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail"></p> ]]></description>

Mark Zuckerberg looks pretty good right now. Facebook's young CEO dreams of a world where we instantly know each others' emotions. To our peril, we're already pretty close.</p> <p>In August, economist Dan Ariely, author of <em>Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions</em>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-ariely25-2008aug25,0,7095289.story">wrote about the "yoked dog" syndrome</a>. In an experiment PETA surely disapproved of, two dogs received a series of mild shocks. One had a switch which turned off the shocks, and rapidly learned to use it. The other had no switch, though the other dog's switch turned off its shocks, too. At the end of the experiment, the second dog ended up whimpering in a corner.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/twitterrecession.png" width="581" height="243"><br clear="all"></p> <p>In case you haven't figured it out, we are the yoked dog. Ariely warned that it would take just one more shock to send us over the edge. Instead, we've had a series of them &mdash; the disappearance of Wall Street, the reduction of Detroit's automakers to beggars, the largest job loss in decades.</p> <p>And we've experienced these shocks not as complex stories, but as 140-character Twitter messages, emails, IMs, and Facebook status updates. The entrepreneurs behind Facebook, Digg, and Twitter have always styled their websites as the future of news, filtered by friends rather than editors. The result is that we have been constantly shocking ourselves. No one thinks to hit the "off" switch, even if we could find it.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/facebooklayoffs.png" width="456" height="165"><br clear="all"></p> <p>Zuckerberg, more than anyone, has set his sights on having us share the entirety of our lives online. In a recent <em>GQ</em> profile, he <a href="http://valleywag.com/5092049/mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-know-how-you-feel">wondered out loud</a> about whether his site could capture our emotions in real time.</p> <p>Is that really a good thing, to broadcast every passing mood to every casual acquaintance we connect with online? Behavioral economists like Ariely, who study the interplay of psychology with our economic decisions, have found that human beings are more motivated by fear of loss than hope of gain. And our biochemical evolution has set us up for fight-or-flight reactions to every flicker of shadow that crosses the savannah.</p> <p>One can see how a real-time, computerized reporting system on other people's feelings can be helpful to, say, sufferers of Asperger's Syndrome, the autism-like condition that limits the ability to understand and react appropriately to emotion. But for the vast majority of us, who react like the yoked dog, the endless stream of data about just how bad things have gotten amounts to death by a thousand shocks.</p> <p>Here's how Zuckerberg could do his part to save the world: An algorithm already rules what information shows up on our Facebook news feeds. By tweaking that to ban bad news and play up anything cheery, Zuckerberg could help us fight our urge to whimper in the corner. Otherwise, he's just leaving the world to go to the dogs.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Tech pundits still wasting money? Mais oui! ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/lemeursarkozy.jpg" width="320" height="289" />Paris is lovely in December. And even lovelier if someone else is footing the bill! Oblivious to the world's economic meltdown, 1,500 self-involved, self-indulgent opinionators have flown to France for Le Web, a meet-and-greet on the tech circuit.</p> <p>Le Web is the brainchild of Loic Le Meur, an entrepreneur best known for peddling a worthless French blog startup to Six Apart, who has parlayed his very slight resume into press clips that include being named one of <em>BusinessWeek's</em> <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/09/0929_most_influential/12.htm">25 most important people on the Web</a>. (One of the 25 most self-important, more like it.)</p> <p>Le Meur is handsome enough, improbably tall for a Frenchman, and charming when he wants to be. As a businessman, he's hopeless; his online-video startup, Seesmic, recently had layoffs and is said to be a hot mess. But it's as a showman that Le Meur excels. He outraged bloggers in 2006 by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6168777.stm">inviting Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, then a French presidential candidate, to speak. (His critics viewed the invitation as crassly sullying the purity of a Web-focused event &mdash; as if the Internet were somehow apart from politics.)</p> <p>To understand the problem, look no further than <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081208/an-american-well-lots-of-them-in-paris-for-le-web/">the guest list</a>, which includes media ubiquity Marissa Mayer, the Google VP in charge of looking good and making money; an also-ran at MySpace; and Chris Anderson, organizer of the TED conference series. Just imagine: You can fly to Europe to attend a tech conference, where you can hear an organizer of a tech conference speak!</p> <p>And yet people pay thousands of dollars &mdash; rather, charge thousands of dollars to their expense accounts &mdash; to do exactly that. They attend parties where they can meet exactly the same crowd they just saw last month at Web 2.0 Summit, and before that at TechCrunch50, and before that at Brainstorm, and before that at D6. Round and round they ride, on the tech-junket carousel. Why doesn't the tech-conference crowd give some of their social-networking tools a try and just gab with each other online? At a time when 533,000 Americans lost their jobs last month, that seems less embarrassing than flying to France to party.</p> <p><em>(Photo via <a href="http://referencement-internet.vox.com/">referencement-internet</a>)</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Yahoo's last hurrah ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228766735818_3090982550_b3e22e2b77_01.jpg" width="340" height="219" />Canceling year-end parties is a hot holiday trend. But Yahoo executives, even as they prepared to put 1,500 employees on the street this week, greenlighted a bash for the troubled Web giant which took place Saturday. The theme: gambling. Appropriate!</p> <p>Why is CEO Jerry Yang all smiles in these pictures with employees, some of whom he's <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081208/yahoo-moves-ahead-with-layoffs-on-wednesday-the-details/">about to lay off</a>? Well, he's losing his job, too &mdash; as soon as the company finds a replacement. (The search is going so poorly that the company may end up tapping a board member out of sheer expediency.) Perhaps that sense of impending loss has allowed the company's billionaire founder to chum around so convincingly with rank-and-file Yahoos at a suburban racetrack south of San Francisco, dolled up to look like a poor imagining of Las Vegas.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/12/custom_1228767498850_3091211770_f0ed1170b6.jpg" width="340" height="226" />The smiles and parties are part of Yahoo's problem. Remember that this company, which started as a collection of links Yang kept online, grew to be worth $100 billion and emerged from the dotcom bust without peer among Internet portals. Back then, a company mandate to embrace fun made up for long hours spent crushing rivals. </p> <p>But Yahoo is now worth a sixth of its peak price, and its culture has since turned into a toxic parody of the kind of public-school self-esteem programs Garry Trudeau once mocked in <em>Doonesbury</em>. Work and achievement aren't properly celebrated at Yahoo. Instead, just showing up to work seems to be what counts. To keep up with Google, Yahoo lavished salary hikes and raises on employees; it now has an uncomfortable number of the overpaid and underworked. Long before the economy turned sour, Yahoo needed to cut back a good quarter of its workforce. As gloomy as the prospect of its coming layoffs are, Yahoo will still have too many employees. But its shareholders paid millions to throw them a party anyway. </p> <p>More shots of Yahoo's last hurrah are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/yep/">on Flickr</a>, the photo site whose employees surely wish it wasn't owned by Yahoo.</p> <p><em>(Photo of Yang with employee by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhouyaoji/3090982550/">zhouyaoji</a>, group shot by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/remfan/3091211770/">remfan</a>)</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Lawyers nix champagne amid popped bubble ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/champagneglasses.jpg" width="160" height="180" />It may be time to put a cork in Silicon Valley's most famous law firm. Wilson Sonsini is no longer celebrating its new attorneys with champagne. That trimmed perk is just the beginning of its woes.</p> <p>Above the Law <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2008/12/sign_of_the_times_no_more_bubb.php">notes</a> that Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati has skipped the annual tradition of awarding associates who passed the bar exam a bottle of champagne. At $40 a bottle for 53 associates, $2,120 is hardly a big expense. But it is a powerful symbolic move: The bubbly times are gone for good.</p> <p>Wilson Sonsini is no mere bill-by-the-hour outfit; the firm and its founders have been key players in establishing Silicon Valley's equity culture, where employees are motivated by stock options that pay off when a company goes public or gets sold. And who handled many of those IPOs and M&A deals? Wilson Sonsini, of course. Larry Sonsini, the firm's best-known founder, has been a consigliere to Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Google CEO Eric Schmidt, among others.</p> <p>This decade has not been good for Wilson Sonsini. The firm has found itself dragged into every major scandal that drew national attention to the clubby world of the Valley, from HP's illegal pretexting of reporters' phone records to the backdating of stock options in many tech firms. Wilson Sonsini paid $9.5 million to one tech company to avoid involvement in litigation &mdash; but there are other backdating lawsuits out there. Observers of the legal profession are waiting to see if one ends up dragging the Valley's most arrogant lawyers into court.</p> <p>Even if Wilson Sonsini escapes legal trouble, it can't dodge the recession. A <a href="http://valleywag.com/5100925/the-bubble-that-wasnt">cold IPO market</a> has already hobbled its business; with public offerings completely frozen, and acquisitions happening for a fraction of the price they commanded even a few years ago, it's hard to see how the firm will make the kind of money it did in the '90s.</p> <p>Wilson Sonsini helped build the Valley's sense of itself as a world apart &mdash; and its own firm as an even more rarefied sphere within that bubble. No wonder they and their clients ended up testing the law's gray areas in the pursuit of . That's why trimming this year's champagne budget isn't a mere cutting of perks: It's a sign that a gang of lawyers who saw themselves as above the rest have floated down to earth. The descent is only beginning.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Halsey Minor, the angriest rich man in America ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/minor-halsey-minor-lede-slide_01.jpg" width="446" height="329" style="display:block;" />Since he escaped the dotcom bust with a considerable fortune, Halsey Minor, the founder of tech-news site CNET, has been acquiring art, real estate, and a blonde trophy wife. You'd think he'd be happy. You'd be wrong.</p> <p>The old adage about money not buying happiness has never been truer. Money makes Minor angry. He is <a href="http://valleywag.com/5084896/halsey-minors-31-million-hole-in-the-ground">thinking about suing his bank</a>. He's already <a href="http://valleywag.com/5046901/halsey-minor-and-the-deal-with-his-art">sued an auction house which helped him buy art</a>. And now he's suing an auction house which helped him sell art. When he's not busy filing lawsuits, he <a href="http://valleywag.com/5077977/cnet-founder-halsey-minor-insults-writers-style">occupies himself by posting enraged comments on blogs</a>.</p> <p>The latest tussle: Minor is <a href="http://www.pehub.com/25461/halsey-minor-drama-continues-first-sotheby%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s-now-christie%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s/">suing Christie's</a> for allegedly failing to return seven Richard Prince paintings he had consigned to them. Christie's says his lawsuit has no merit, and it plans to countersue for $10 million plus legal expenses.</p> <p>If it follows through on the legal threat, Christie's will join Sotheby's, which is already suing Minor for failing to pay for a set of paintings, including Edward Hicks's "Peaceable Kingdom."</p> <p>Art makes Minor mad. After a spat with Damien Hirst, he removed several of the artist's butterfly tableaux from the walls of Minor Ventures, his San Francisco startup incubator, leaving fist-sized holes in the plaster, <em>according to <em>Portfolio</em></em>.</p> <p>So why is Minor spending money on art instead of making it himself? This kind of rage, channeled into creative endeavors, could command high prices even in a depressed market. His Internet comments are a whole new form of literary oeuvre. His work is fresh, surprising, visceral, and inexplicable &mdash; everything the jaded art world desires.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Facebook cancels employee stock sale ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/markzuckerberggrumpy.jpg" width="344" height="344" />So much for Silicon Valley's latest get-rich-quick scheme. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has cancelled a plan to let employees cash out their shares early.</p> <p>In August, before the markets started to melt down and with Facebook worth $15 billion on paper, Zuckerberg unveiled a plan to let employees sell a small amount of their shares &mdash; no more than $900,000 or 20 percent of their stock holdings, whichever was less. The program, all but unheard of among Valley startups, was meant to appease employees who were agitating for some chance to make money from their shares. It was a revolutionary new way to reward employees, without having to go through an IPO or a sale.</p> <p>The revolution is over, Zuckerberg told his company today. "I'm writing this note to let you know some bad news," he wrote in an email to all employees at the 800-person social-network startup this afternoon. "Despite a lot of work, we have not been able to finalize a plan for the employee stock sale we announced in August."</p> <p>Facebook executives had been courting potential buyers for employees' shares since the summer. But as the value of Google tumbled from its high of $700 last year, would-be investors started asking questions about whether Facebook's value, too, had dropped. By last month, they were <a href="http://valleywag.com/5096252/is-the-great-facebook-stock-sale-over">getting downright nervous</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft had invested $240 million in the company for a 1.6 percent stake in the company that valued all of Facebook at $15 billion, but that deal came with extras: Microsoft bought preferred shares, which get paid off first if the company's bought, and it also got an advertising deal with Facebook at the same time.</p> <p>Facebook's common shares, meanwhile, have a value that put the whole company's worth at around $4 billion. Or they did. A source close to potential investors said they wanted to buy shares from employees at a lower valuation, or with guarantees similar to Microsoft's. To reward a small number of employees who had enough shares to benefit from the program, Zuckerberg would have had to give away something for nothing.</p> <p>It's still a crushing blow to morale at the company that was once Silicon Valley's highest-flying startup. Facebook once had the pick of the world's best and brightest, hiring brilliant kids from college who had gone through school addicted to the social network.</p> <p>So Zuckerberg's back to the original startup business plan: Make a big bet, and hope it pays off years later with an IPO or a sale. Facebookers will have to make the same bet, too. It's not as exciting as overturning Silicon Valley's financial order. But right now, just drawing a paycheck seems like a lucky thing.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Google CEO's unemployed girlfriend ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/katebohnerlaptop.png" width="302" height="316" />What's the use of dating a megabillionaire if he can't throw some bucks your way? Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who's been seeing video producer Kate Bohner <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/google/does-eric-schmidt-have-a-new-girlfriend-301020.php">since last fall</a>, hasn't come through with funding for her documentary production firm, so she's out of a job.</p> <p>Bohner, a former journalist and TV personality who was once briefly married to author Michael Lewis, took up with the married Schmidt last year while she was living and working in south Florida. Since then, Schmidt "paid her an ungodly amount of money" to relocate <a href="http://www.katebohnerproductions.com/">her business</a>, Kate Bohner Productions, to Los Angeles; she set up shop on Pacific Avenue in Venice, Calif. He's been spending the occasional weekend with her, flying down from the Bay Area on Thursday and leaving Saturday, staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel. (Schmidt saw her twice in October and at least once in November.)</p> <p>But besides paying for the move and buying Bohner a new set of diamond earrings on every trip, Schmidt, whose net worth has been estimated at $6 billion, hasn't been forthcoming with cash. He attended a meeting at Bohner's firm to get pitched on funding a new $1 million documentary show. It sounds like he didn't bite, because Bohner's said to be losing her job.</p> <p>Will Schmidt set Bohner up with a job at Google, as he did with <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/marcy-simon/googlephone-pr-in-the-hands-of-ceos-girlfriend-296358.php">a previous girlfriend, PR exec Marcy Simon</a>? Bohner has told people she's already been working for Google &mdash; for free. She's been writing executive summaries about Google's push into the cell-phone market, work she estimates she could have billed at $250,000.</p> <p>So why is Schmidt being so cheap? It's possible he's nervous about bad publicity that could come from leaving a money trail. He's said to have an arrangement with his wife Wendy, but she may not appreciate having the name of Schmidt's girlfriend make the headlines. So why doesn't he buddy up with some other media mogul and get them to fund Bohner's company on the sly? Ah, there's the rub: Schmidt has been so aggressively unlikeable in his dealings with other media CEOs that he doesn't have any chits to cash in.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Electric carmaker's motormouth marketer ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/Darryl-Siry-Tesla-photo_01.jpg" width="185" height="261" />Tesla Motors, once the best hope of Silicon Valley's nascent electric-car industry, is getting better known for manufacturing drama than vehicles. The company just saw its top marketer, Darryl Siry leave &mdash; allegedly after running his mouth about ex-employees.</p> <p>Silicon Valley has a bit of an honesty fetish. But there's such a thing as being too honest, and that may have been Siry's flaw. Siry's a voluble sort; he blogs about <a href="http://sirycars.blogspot.com/">cars</a> and <a href="http://sirymarketing.blogspot.com/">marketing</a>. As a corporate flack, he's relatively forthright &mdash; which is fine when, say, arguing the technical merits of Tesla's $109,000 Roadster sports car, the preferred ride of geeks from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to Mahalo CEO Jason Calacanis. But when it comes to talking about personnel matters, that bluntness may be what cost him his job &mdash; and Tesla millions of dollars.</p> <p>Siry writes in his blog that he quit over "disagreements in strategy." But here's what two Tesla insiders claim: After Siry made comments in the press about the reasons why the company laid off or fired certain employees, some of them threatened to sue. It's not clear what, exactly, Siry said that was so incendiary, though back in January, he <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/01/11/teslas-layoffs-bad-blood-a-bloodbath-or-business-as-usual/">told a tech blog</a> that some laid-off workers were "not the best on the team" &mdash; the kind of evaluation that could jeopardize a job search. Tesla, we're told, settled the lawsuits for $2 million &mdash; and told Siry it was time to motor on.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Siry says he had no knowledge of any settlements and that he left for unrelated reasons. So why are two unrelated sources saying he did? Curiouser and curiouser.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Google's austerity campaign ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/googlecover.jpg" width="464" height="604" style="display:block;" />The best place to work in America is becoming like every other big corporation. Google, at its heart an overgrown advertising agency, is most famous for its lavish perks. Now those are disappearing.</p> <p>The billions gushing in from Google's search monopoly don't make for a good story. Whenever Google's PR executives have looked to drum up press, they've led with the candy-colored offices, the free food, and the copious free time. All of those are now on the chopping block &mdash; which leaves not much to talk about at Google except the profits.</p> <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> takes a look at Google's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122826503489174369.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">new push for cost cuts</a>. As <a href="http://valleywag.com/tag/google/food-fight/">others have reported</a>, Google is curtailing service at its cafeterias, reducing hours and restricting guests. A third of Google's 30,000 workers are contractors &mdash; and many of those jobs will disappear. (Conveniently, when a contract ends, it's not deemed a layoff.) And superfluous offices are being shut.</p> <p>More importantly, Google's employees no longer have free rein to pursue their own ideas. Google's engineers can spend 20 percent of time on side projects. That freedom remains, in theory, but the progress a lone engineer can make on a new website without hardware and additional personnel is limited. The new message: Fiddle all you want, but don't expect any money from Google to back your creation.</p> <p>When Google went public in 2004, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin told shareholders to get ready to be taken for a ride. Not in so many words, of course. But in the company's IPO prospectus, they defended the company's already-lavish perks, and said that investors should expect spending to go up, not down.</p> <p>But Larry and Sergey have grown tired of coddling their employees. Far from being grateful, the perks have made employees feel entitled. Brin in particular has complained about workers taking bowls of M&Ms and free bottled water for granted.</p> <p>Why should Google's founders care, really? They seem increasingly detached from Google's core business, preferring to spend time on rockets and electric sports cars rather than optimizing AdWords. They increasingly deal with a small core of early Google employees, all IPO lottery winners, who are similarly insulated from the economic reality of living in one of the most expensive areas in the U.S.</p> <p>A famous example of their cluelessness: Brin allowed his sister-in-law, Susan Wojcicki, also a Google executive, to <a href="http://valleywag.com/5016355/google-daycare-now-a-luxury-for-larry-and-sergeys-inner-circle">spend millions of Google's money on a new child-care center</a> which dramatically raised its costs. Rather than revise plans to make child-care more affordable, Google <a href="http://valleywag.com/tag/google/kinderplex/">started charging employees nearly twice the market rate</a>.</p> <p>Investors will be unbothered by Larry and Sergey's change of heart. And employees, after they get done grumbling, will likely content themselves with the reality that they still have jobs.</p> <p>No, the people hit hardest by this will be Google's flacks &mdash; and the servile journalists who so eagerly celebrated Google's lava-lamp culture. What stories will they tell now? How Google is cutting corners on the organic foie-gras hamburgers in its cafes?</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Yahoo's sad, sad state ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/sadhoo.jpg" width="170" height="170" />Another day, another hare-brained scheme to buy Yahoo. This time, the player isn't Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but former AOL CEO Jon Miller, who now runs a venture-capital fund. But the prospect of a deal seems as far off and fanciful as Microsoft, which spent most of the spring and summer trying to buy Yahoo, coming back to the negotiating table. Miller wants to buy Yahoo, but is having trouble coming up with the money, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122823988574372899.html?mod=djemalertTECH">reports</a>. Is there no one serious who wants to buy this company?</p> <p>It's been a grindingly frustrating comedown for what was once the preeminent brand on the Web. Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for $45 billion in February; the company is now worth a third of that. Miller would pay $28 billion to $30 billion for Yahoo, if he can raise that sum from sovereign wealth funds, the investment pools run by cash-flush Middle Eastern and Asian governments. They are understandably skittish at the idea of paying twice the going rate for a stake in Yahoo.</p> <p>The notion is that Miller would run the show, and thereby make money for his investors. Fired as AOL's CEO in 2006, Miller has been rehabilitating his reputation as an investor ever since. (He's been amply helped by his replacement, former NBC executive Randy Falco, who has proved to be a thoroughly useless corporate stooge.) But Miller did not demonstrate at AOL what Yahoo so desperately needs: a keen product vision, and a ruthless determination to get his way with dithering engineers.</p> <p>It's pathetic, really, that Yahoo hasn't yet been sold or found a CEO to replace hapless founder Jerry Yang. The company's traffic is still immense. And it's big in Japan! Someone, somewhere ought to think that Yahoo is worth saving. That Miller is the best Yahoo can find speaks volumes</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Twitter's bad news is a bad business ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/twitter_fail_whale_01.png" width="400" height="300" style="display:block;" />People who use Twitter, a service which posts short updates to the Web and cell phones, love nothing more than to Twitter about themselves, and the medium they've so enthusiastically adopted. If you go by the Twitterers' collective reporting, every event, from an earthquake in Los Angeles to terrorist bombings in Mumbai, is more notable for the fact that people are writing about it on Twitter than for its inherent interest as news. The dominant narrative of Twitter is the rise of Twitter, the latest force to displace the mainstream media and roil the world's information economy. Too bad the real story of the company is one of top-to-bottom incompetence.</p> <p>'Twas always thus. Twitter was never really a company; it was a feature invented at another forgotten startup, spun off into its own venture. The programmer who came up with the idea for Twitter, Jack Dorsey, was named CEO, while Twitter's better-known backer, Ev Williams, a Webhead who struck it rich by selling Blogger to Google five years ago, dithered about how much he wanted to be involved.</p> <p>Despite Williams' seeming indifference, Twitter took off &mdash; so much so that a crush of new users strained its servers, to the point that the service became famous for its technical incompetence. (The "fail whale," a cheery cetacean icon displayed when Twitter's website was unavailable, now appears on T-shirts in San Francisco and Brooklyn.)</p> <p>In its business affairs, too, Twitter is proving incompetent. Most Web 2.0 startups run cheaply, but Twitter faces large bills from cell-phone companies which charge it for forwarding text messages to cell phones; the more it grows, the more it pays. And it has yet to announce publicly a way to make money.</p> <p>That's not to say it doesn't have a scheme. The latest one we've heard floated: Twitter would charge companies to have verified Twitter feeds, so users would know that a message from, say, ExxonMobil really came from the oil company. (It's not as hypothetical as it sounds; a Twitter user <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/08/01/how-janet-fooled-the-twittersphere-shes-the-voice-of-exxon-mobil/">inexplicably impersonated ExxonMobil this summer</a>.) Verified accounts might then pay Twitter for every message they send, and also get prominent listing in a Twitter directory.</p> <p>If that sounds like utter nonsense, the fever-dream imaginings of a desperate business-development executive high on whiteboard-marker fumes, that's because it is.</p> <p>With no real hope of making money on its own, Twitter's best hope is a buyout. But its executives have handled that poorly, too. Dorsey botched talks with Yahoo and then Facebook; he didn't even tell his own board of directors he was talking to Facebook about a proposed $500 million acquisition. After that, he was <a href="http://valleywag.com/5065265/ev-williams-didnt-twitter-that-he-fired-his-ceo">fired as CEO</a> and replaced by Williams, but stayed on as chairman, a nominal job which doesn't require his presence at the Twitter office. One prominent Silicon Valley investor is fuming that Dorsey is still on the payroll at all.</p> <p>This Mickey Mouse operation is the future of news? That's not the most frightening prospect. Even if Twitter were competently run and profitable, the end result is an unreadable jumble. Look closely at the coverage, if you can call it that, <a href="http://valleywag.com/5099873/on-mumbai-tragedy-twitter-proves-useful-in-its-uselessness">of the Mumbai attacks on Twitter</a>. Sitting at their desks in the U.S., most people had nothing to add except to observe that Mumbai used to be called Bombay &mdash; the kind of message that makes you wish Twitter's length limit was zero characters, not 140.</p> <p>As more users join, the Twitter feed becomes filled with more and more noise; repetitive retweetings, back-scratching praise, and self-congratulation. A set of amateurs celebrating each other not for the quality or insight of their reporting, but its brevity, swiftness, and modish form of delivery. You read it here on first. Unless you heard about it on Twitter.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Temptress of Silicon Valley shuts down useless site ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/leahcover.jpg" width="166" height="178" />Earlier this year, Leah Culver <a href="http://valleywag.com/5023433/the-microbubble-in-microblogging">appeared on the cover of a tech magazine</a> blowing an enormous pink bubble. But the shrill-voiced San Francisco programmer no longer desires fame &mdash; even the modest sort afforded Silicon Valley's microcelebrities. The turnabout seems odd, considering how aggressively she once courted notoriety.</p> <p>Culver is <a href="http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/">shutting down Pownce</a>, a Twitter knockoff which served as her vehicle for entrepreneurial achievement. Pownce's origins are notable in the way they show that connections rule the funding of startups in Silicon Valley, an industry whose capitalists relentlessly brag about their devotion to meritocracy.</p> <p>Pownce allowed users to send each other short messages and, most importantly, share files; bootlegging MP3s was a popular if unacknowledged use. But it was more notable for its main backer: Kevin Rose, the languid-eyed founder of social-news site Digg, funded Pownce at a time when one of his employees, Daniel Burka, was dating Culver. </p> <p>Rose's Web fame lent Pownce Internet-insider buzz; Burka applied his design skills to the site. (Both men moonlighted on the project while working at Digg.) Culver broke up with Burka before the site launched, taking up with Brad Fitzpatrick, the founder of LiveJournal, an online diary site which had been purchased by blog-software maker Six Apart. </p> <p>That relationship didn't last, either. But it brought Culver attention in the right circles. Six Apart is now purchasing Pownce's technology and hiring Culver. This kind of deal, known as an asset acquisition, is typically the least lucrative kind of startup sale, suggesting Culver, Rose, and others involved in Pownce didn't make much money. But at least she got a job where she can prove herself as a programmer, or not, out of the spotlight.</p> <p>If she's sincere about avoiding fame, Culver will have to reform more than her work life. Granted, San Francisco's pool of straight men is on the small side. But besides Burka and Fitzpatrick, Culver also dated <a href="http://valleywag.com/5028786/flickrs-cal-henderson-dumped-by-technology-review-covergirl-leah-culver">Cal Henderson, an engineering director at Flickr</a>; MG Siegler, a writer at tech blog VentureBeat; and Nick Douglas, a former editor at Valleywag and Gawker. If she doesn't want to be famous, Culver might want to take a look at her <a href="http://valleywag.com/368625/help-leah-culver-pick-the-right-man">relentless technosexuality</a>, which more than hints at the acquisition of influence rather than intimacy as its goal.</p> <p>Is it sexist to point this out? Perhaps, but not nearly as sexist as touting technical skills while sleeping your way to the top.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Why Facebook wants to spam your News Feed ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/12/heidiklumfacebook.jpg" width="450" height="353" style="display:block;" />Social networks have a lifecycle: They start with a small core of early adopters, swell as mainstream users get pulled in by their friends, and then see growth taper off as people get turned off by spam. That's why Friendster is forgotten and why MySpace is looking increasingly stagnant. The price for reaching an audience advertisers care about seems to be a site users can't stand. Facebook, however, isn't following the fashionable trend.</p> <p>By the numbers, there are no signs of Facebook fatigue. The social network's ranks swelled from 100 million in August to 120 million in October. If it sustains that improbable pace, it will encompass the entire world's population by 2012.</p> <p>There's a threat to Facebook's dominance &mdash; and it's not the one you'd think. Privacy is the bugaboo everyone brings up. The company has launched a new program, Facebook Connect, which links other websites into Facebook's News Feed, the site's tattletale compendium of their friends' online activities. Connect, which is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/technology/internet/01facebook.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">profiled in today's <em>Times</em></a>, is similar in some ways to Beacon, a feature which outraged privacy activists around this time last year when it revealed Facebook users' holiday purchases. But Beacon proved a short-lived Grinch; Facebook rapidly modified the program, and the protests died down.</p> <p>If anything, the complaint users have about Facebook is not that the site shares their private details, but that their so-called friends do. A surfeit of information has led some to cull their friends' lists on the site. That's more than fine with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has always sought to have his site reflect real-world relationships.</p> <p>Facebook's trust problem isn't with users; it's with the Web publishers and application developers Facebook executives are trying so desperately to court. And this is a serious problem, because they're the people on which Facebook is trying to build a next-generation advertising business.</p> <p>By developing Facebook apps &mdash; if you've thrown a sheep or been bitten by a zombie on Facebook, you'ved used one of these &mdash; or signing up with Connect, these companies are essentially advertising on Facebook. They're just doing it subtly, through the News Feed &mdash; and sometimes the advertisement is simply for their own service. The medium is new, but the intent is the same as any other advertiser's: To interrupt users and grab their attention.</p> <p>Which makes Facebook Connect's lack of progress curious. The company has signed up some minor players &mdash; among online-video sites, Hulu but not YouTube; for city guides, CitySearch but not Yelp; the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> but not <em>The New York Times</em>; and so on. By far the biggest omission, though, are the makers of Facebook apps.</p> <p>When Facebook allowed outsiders to write applications for its site last year, companies like Slide, RockYou, iLike, and Flixster eagerly signed up; the largest Facebook-app developers raised hundreds of millions of dollars on the promise that they could piggyback on the Facebook phenomenon. But then came the zombies.</p> <p>Apps which let you, say, bite your friends and turn them into werewolves provided mindless entertainment to some and annoyance to others proliferated; clever developers figured out ways to get users to spam their friends to get them to sign up for the app, too. The abuses proliferated &mdash; and Facebook's growth slowed measurably.</p> <p>So Facebook cracked down on the application developers &mdash; unfairly and arbitrarily, some say. iLike, a music app, and Causes, an app which let users spread the word about do-gooding efforts, got special treatment, while other apps were temporarily removed from Facebook for privacy violations or spam. The image problems got so bad that Facebook, to the derision of many, appointed its top flack, Elliot Schrage, to run its platform efforts.</p> <p>Those same application developers are now telling anyone who asks to take a wait-and-see attitude with Connect. The main attraction of Connect, as with the application platform before it, is placement in Facebook's News Feed. The lesson developers learned with the Facebook platform is that there are no guarantees of placement, and that the rules change too rapidly to build a solid business on it.</p> <p>That's why Digg, the popular news-discussion website founded by Web 2.0 playboy Kevin Rose, is rumored to have struck a deal with Facebook that guaranteed a level of News Feed placement before it agreed to sign up with Connect. And app developers are advising other potential Facebook partners to get similar guarantees in writing.</p> <p>It's a dilemma for Facebook. Zuckerberg has avoided the spam problems that doomed Friendster and hobbled MySpace; by cracking down on app developers, he's kept Facebook appealing to its users. But to keep Facebook independent and turn it into a big business, he'll have to build up a big advertising business. And inserting commercial messages into the News Feed is key to that. It's spam by another name, with an invoice attached.</p> <p>Zuckerberg may be reluctant to make promises to other Connect partners precisely because his advertising salespeople are hoping to charge them for guaranteed placement. CBS, which is airing this year's Victoria's Secret lingerie show on Wednesday, has signed up with Connect, and the network is paying to make sure that people read on Facebook about their friends' plans to tune in to watch Heidi Klum. That's a harbinger of the future.</p> <p>The application developers and website operators vying for Facebook users' attention might be relieved if Facebook just started explicitly charging for placement. A rate card would be easier to decipher than Facebook's obscure and constantly shifting antispam rules. But will a deluge of sponsored messages turn off users? There's no easy answer. If there were, Mark Zuckerberg might be more than a paper billionaire by now.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Is the great Facebook stock sale over? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/13-mark_zuckerberg_facebook_01.jpg" width="332" height="369" />Through the golden heart of every world-changing startup pulses an avaricious get-rich-quick scheme. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the billionaire-boy cofounders of Google, established this doing-well-by-doing-good myth. But Mark Zuckerberg hasn't been able to make the same magic happen for his employees. In his efforts to make good by them, he may end up quashing a nascent market in Facebook shares.</p> <p>It's not for lack of trying. Silicon Valley's stock-options millionaire make money by getting the right to buy shares at a low price and selling them for a higher one. Facebook's soaring valuation &mdash; Microsoft invested $240 million for a tiny stake, in a deal which valued all of Facebook at $15 billion &mdash; threatened to undo that equation. How is Facebook supposed to soar past $15 billion in value? So Zuckerberg & Co. turned to issuing restricted stock units, or RSUs, instead. (Restricted stock units are common at large companies like Google and Microsoft, but unusual for a company Facebook's size and age.)</p> <p>The restricted-stock plan has created a new complication: Once it has more than 500 RSU holders, SEC regulations may require Facebook to start publishing its financials, even if it doesn't conduct an initial public offering. Facebook's revenues still aren't pretty enough for public exposure.</p> <p>Facebook's lawyers have <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2008/tc20081120_566312.htm">sought, and obtained, an exemption</a>. Part of the argument they made is that issuing RSUs won't create a market in Facebook shares. </p> <p>Facebook, unusually for most of Silicon Valley's private companies, has not had many restrictions on what employees and other shareholders could do with the shares they own. Most have rules that force shareholders to offer shares to the company first &mdash; a right of first refusal &mdash; or outright prohibitions on unauthorized sales.</p> <p>But the letter Facebook sent to the SEC says that even when the stock units convert to common shares, they have limits on their sale: "... the Plan has been structured to preclude any trading of RSUs or any interest therein from developing." Even if Facebook permits an employee convert their stock units to shares and sell them, the company can then prevent the buyer from selling.</p> <p>Employees at Facebook &mdash; especially the early ones, whose holdings are now substantial &mdash; have been agitating for some time to sell their shares, and there are still, even with the public markets taking a beating, interested buyers. Zuckerberg finally bowed to this pressure and set up a program, now underway, to let employees cash out up to $900,000 in shares. (Note the symbolism of the figure: No one will become a millionaire.)</p> <p>But that may be it. If Facebook extends its stock-sale restrictions to common shares, not just the restricted-stock units, both employees and the investors so eager to snap up their shares will be stuck, until Facebook sells out or goes public. Zuckerberg has made it clear he thinks both of those events are far off &mdash; and the 24-year-old CEO still owns 27 percent of the company and more or less controls the board.</p> <p>It's a dicey gamble. The prospect of selling Facebook shares privately must surely have attracted some employees who counted on a relatively quick cash-out. But shutting down the prospect of further stock sales will make sure the Facebookers who remain will be more committed to the company for the long haul.</p> <p>Zuckerberg doesn't have much choice. As long as Facebook employees can find buyers for their shares, they'll be tempted to leave rather than stay at a company going through a tumultous adolescence. </p> <p>Already, the company has had far more turnover, from bottom to top, than Google did. Not a single high-ranking exec left Google <a href="http://searchengineland.com/megachart-analysis-google-executive-management-changes-2000-2008-13683.php">for the first six years of its existence</a>. Facebook has lost <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/also_rans/facebooks-wannabe-founders-279073.php">three of its four cofounders</a>, and <a href="http://valleywag.com/tag/facebook/exits/">numerous people underneath them</a>, from former COO Owen Van Natta on down. No wonder Zuckerberg wants to slam the exit door closed.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ How Ashton Kutcher killed a startup guy's Hollywood dream ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/framekutcher.png" width="300" height="201" />It was a fantasy left over from the last boom: Hire a movie star to pitch your startup, and the dusting of tinsel will turbocharge sales. Those William Shatner ads sold plane tickets for Priceline, right? But the career of hard-partying entrepreneur Andrew Frame did not follow that script. We hear he was just fired as CEO of the Internet-phone startup he cofounded, Ooma. His most notable decision, hiring actor Ashton Kutcher as "creative director," did not pan out; Kutcher made a few <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/clips/ooma-gets-creepier-302015.php">incomprehensible videos</a>, and then faded from the scene.</p> <p>Frame, a high-school dropout who'd nevertheless managed to get a job at Cisco, the networking-equipment maker, could have been at least a TV star himself; he <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/notag/andrew-frame-and-gob-from-arrested-development-269236.php">looks eerily like</a> Will Arnett's G.O.B. character on <em>Arrested Development.</em> And Ooma's products, the Hub and the Scout, are pleasant enough to look at, too. As if there wasn't enough of a Hollywood connection, Frame <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/ooma/andrew-frames-startup-is-older-than-it-looks-280542.php">lied about the Palo Alto-based startup's age</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/andrewframegob.jpg" width="155" height="180" />But a pretty face is not enough. Ooma's problem, minus the technical analysis, amounted to this: It was never as simple as a Hollywood pitch. <a href="http://valleywag.com/377932/ashton-kutcher+backed-startup-ooma-is-falling-apart">Try as he might</a>, Kutcher could never turn it into a movie trailer. (Perhaps if he'd hired the late voiceover artist Don LaFontaine to intone "In a world without phone bills ...", it might have had a chance.) </p> <p>Cell-phone carriers long ago figured out that making phones cheap and charging more for monthly service helped win subscribers. Ooma tried to flip that around, charging $399.99 for a Hub device and offering phone service for free. It has since slashed the price to $249.99 &mdash; but enrolled all new customers in a $99.99/year service plan for extra voicemail features. (You have to cancel the service to after a 60-day free trial to avoid being charged for it.)</p> <p>Frame tried to compensate for these <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/deathwatch/why-ooma-is-doomad-280257.php">flaws in his business plan</a> with a crush of PR. Servile tech blogs like TechCrunch, eager to talk up the Kutcher connection, played along without asking hard questions about Ooma's product. Ultimately, that's what undid him. Our tipster tells us the board "is done with Frame's lack of integrity and moneywasting PR trips and took him out." Other executives have been reshuffled, and a former president of Vonage &mdash; a more conventional Internet-phone service that's also losing money &mdash; is trying to help the company raise money. </p> <p>If this were a movie script, it would be time for the third act and a happy ending. But I don't think Ooma will go Hollywood in that way, either.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Tim Weingarten, an Ooma board member and investor, has sent the following response:<br /> <blockquote>I read your article today about Andrew Frame, and as an investor and ooma board member from when I first seed-funded ooma, I feel compelled to correct several inaccuracies. I think it's important you hear this directly from someone who is both a board member and also the largest investor in the company.</p> <p>1. Andrew has not been fired from the company. The company has made substantial progress with Andrew as CEO. It has been Andrew's vision, leadership and guidance that made it clear to me and the other ooma investors to invest the $45m of capital that has gone into the company over the last 4 years. Andrew's involvement and vision for the future product direction is a critical aspect of the board's intent to invest more in ooma in the future.</p> <p>2. Andrew's success and contribution at Cisco was the foundation for the original bet we placed on ooma. He joined Cisco at a very young age and excelled quickly to be a top respected technical expert and contributor throughout the organization. We place our bets on people and we performed significant due diligence on Andrew's accomplishments at Cisco and elsewhere and were very impressed with his references and contributions in companies small and large before ooma.</p> <p>3. The company is growing revenue rapidly and we are pleased as a board with their progress.</p></blockquote> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Suicide by webcam ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/biggsdeath.jpg" width="445" height="364" style="display:block;" />Lifecasting, a kind of <a href="http://whoisjonray.com/2007/09/03/your-life-on-the-web-247-this-is-lifecasting/">do-it-yourself reality TV</a> broadcast on the Internet, has thousands of practitioners. Until last night, one of them was Abraham Biggs, a 19-year-old Florida resident, who used a webcam to broadcast his death, too.</p> <p>Wednesday night, after he <a href="http://www.lipstickalley.com/showthread.php?t=162252">posted a suicide note on the Web</a>, he overdosed on pills on camera as users of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site, watched. Some posted comments egging Biggs on. When he took the pills and stopped moving, they laughed, expecting his corpse to revive and announce it was all a joke. No one called the police until hours had passed. They kept watching as officers came to the scene and verified his death. Even then, commenters wrote "OMFG" and "LOL."</p> <p><a href="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/biggsdeathjustintv.png" rel="lytebox" class="ppImgCont2" title="Justin.tv comments on the suicide of Abraham Biggs" style="background-image: url('http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/11/custom_1227253334139_biggsdeathjustintv.png');width: 340px; height: 204px;"></a></p> <p>NewTeeVee, an online-video industry publication, <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/11/20/19-year-old-commits-suicide-on-justintv/">called the incident</a> a "a striking display of the power of live video." The power, but definitely not the glory: It shows how the viewers of lifecasting devalue life. Users of sites like Justin.tv have grown accustomed to watching people mug for the camera. All the world's a stage, and all the men and women on webcams are merely players. But what happens when we're not playing around?</p> <p>Justin.tv CEO Michael Seibel, in a statement, didn't comment on the video, merely noting the site's policy for removing content flagged as "objectionable." The digital record of Biggs's death is just bits on a server. What about the users who cheered Biggs on as he performed a snuff film? Can we flag them, too? There will always be teenagers who try to kill themselves in awful ways. But one would hope the audience would not applaud.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Google heir born? Sergey Brin spotted at maternity ward ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/SergeyBaby.jpg" width="600" height="450" style="display:block;" />What to expect when you're expecting a billionaire? A tipster reports seeing Google cofounder Sergey Brin running into a hospital, orange Crocs and all. Here's what that means: His wife, Anne Wojcicki, is nine months pregnant with the couple's first child &mdash; who will be born into a fortune still worth $10 billion or more, even with Google shares plummeting. The spot where Brin was sighted, El Camino Hospital, has one of the Bay Area's best childbirth practices, and is close to Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. When we last saw Wojcicki, she was on <em>Oprah</em> <a href="http://valleywag.com/5087925/sergey-brins-very-pregnant-wife-on-oprah">talking about 23andMe, her genetics-testing startup</a>, with the TV host herself begging Wojcicki to give birth already. It's possible that Brin was just there to tour the hospital, a common practice before birth, but his haste suggested otherwise, our tipster claims:</p> <blockquote> <p>I saw Sergey Brin (in all his blaze red-orange Croc glory) eating outside the Marya Cafe in the Melchor pavilion. After he was done eating he ran across the street towards the Orchard pavilion which is the maternity ward for El Camino hospital in Mountain View.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brin and Wojcicki drew notice for the way they <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/wedding-announcements/sergey-brin-and-anne-wojcicki-260039.php">got married in May 2007 in the Bahamas</a>, swimming to the sandbar. But they also got attention for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/technology/29google.html">way they handled a conflict of interest</a>; Brin lent 23andMe his own money to start up, and then Google repaid the loan and became an investor. The company's board approved the deal, but it has never lost the appearance of self-dealing.</p> <p>In what quirky way will they celebrate the birth not just of their first child, but the first member of the great Google dynasty? In Japan, the successor to the throne was greeted <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1641804.html">with shouts of "Banzai!"</a></p> <p>But we suspect Brin will be more low-key. Perhaps he will order up a new doodle for Google's homepage. We'll let you know as soon as we know more about this momentous occasion &mdash; the advent of the generation which will save us from the mistakes of the Google era.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Second Life's death knell ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/0_61_google_lively_oooh.jpg" width="320" height="240" />Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/lively-no-more.html">shut down Lively</a>, a service where people log on to chat and explore 3D virtual spaces, after a few short months. The MBAs of Silicon Valley have a pat phrase for the arrival of a competitor on the scene: They say it "validates their space." What does it say, then, that Lively is gone? It means that Second Life, the best known of these unreal universes, is doomed, too.</p> <p>The notion of a metaverse has long fascinated geeks. The idea of "avatars" &mdash; three-dimensional representations of the self rendered in pixels, often fantastical or surreal in nature &mdash; wandering through a computer-generated environment has been explored in the science-fiction novels of Neal Stephenson, William Gibson, and Bruce Sterling, among others. The <em>Matrix</em> trilogy introduced the idea at multiplexes from coast to coast.</p> <p>And yet unreal worlds have never taken off in actual reality. Philip Rosedale, the creator of Second Life, once showed me screens at the headquarters of his company, Linden Lab, which monitored in real time the number of people logging in. They peaked at 50,000, the maximum simultaneous capacity of its servers. That's not a virtual world; that's a midsized town.</p> <p>Anecdotally, many of Second Life's users are there for virtual sex. (The company has banned gambling, so there's little other reason to go there.) The PG-rated Lively, censored by Google, did not even have that; its only draw was innocuous chat, with the occasional subversive attempt by users at raciness.</p> <p>No wonder that news organizations, drawn by the visual appeal of the service's 3D graphics, aren't writing stories about Second Life anymore. Reuters, at the height of the frenzy, opened up a bureau; its Second Life correspondent <a href="http://secondlife.reuters.com/">stopped filing copy since September</a>, having left to write for a blog, and the wire service has not replaced him.</p> <p>The most recent noise to come out of Second Life has been an uproar over price hikes. Second Life users periodically hold colorful protests in the virtual world &mdash; probably the most entertaining thing that ever happens there &mdash; over this new rule or that new rule. They are likely to become more frequent, as Linden Lab, to survive, focuses on squeezing more revenue out of its existing customers, who pay the company "taxes" on their virtual real estate and convert real money into the company's imaginary currency, Linden dollars.</p> <p>Online 3D environments are not a fad; millions inhabit them for hours, sometimes days at a time. But they do so in networked videogames like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, where there's a clear purpose to being there &mdash; even if it's just having fun and wasting time. Second Life, Lively, and virtual worlds like them amount to glorified chat rooms, and while chatting is a fundamental human activity, it's hard for anyoen to make money on it.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Gays now entitled to inept online dating ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/Wedding-Cake-Topper-for-Gay-Couple-730528.jpg" width="233" height="320" />eHarmony does not hate gay people. It is merely ignorant of them. That is the dating site's excuse for excluding same-sex customers &mdash; a practice that led a gay New Jersey man, Eric McKinley, to file a complaint with New Jersey's attorney general which eHarmony has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122714242388642779.html">just settled</a>, paying a $50,000 fine to the state and $5,000 to McKinley. eHarmony was founded in 2000 by Neil Clark Warren, an evangelical Christian and a psychologist; he is still the company's chairman.</p> <p>To settle the complaint, eHarmony is also launching Compatible Partners, a gay dating site. But the Compatible site, as proposed is not just separate; it's also unequal. </p> <p>eHarmony executives have long insisted that they didn't want to serve gay daters because their site used an algorithm based on long-term studies of straight couples. Compatible Partners, which must launch by March, will <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335035,00.asp">use the same questionnaire</a> as eHarmony &mdash; but the company admits it has no idea if it will work to find good matches. Compatible Partners users will see a warning to this effect: "The statement lets customers know that eHarmony, Inc. has not conducted research on same-sex couples so that they have the information they need to decide whether to use our service."</p> <p>If anyone shows up that is; eHarmony will give away 10,000 free accounts, but it's hard to think that a dating service chaired by a conservative Christian will prove much more popular than, say, Manhunt, the <a href="http://gawker.com/5038336/manhunt-chairman-forced-to-resign-once-users-discover-that-hes-a-mean-old-republican">gay personals site whose chairman donated to John McCain's campaign</a>.</p> <p>The politics of sex aside, the website's clearly going to suck. This should sound so familiar to people who build websites for a living: A poorly thought-out product, based on insufficient research, rushed out on an artificial deadline. But in this case, it's the government, not inept managers, who are ordering it up. They're from the government, and they're here to help your dating life! If gays can't get married in California, don't they at least deserve the benefit of their own pseudoscientifically valid hookups?</p> <p><em>(Photo via <a href="http://www.magicmud.com/2007/06/same-sex-wedding-cake-topper.html">Magicmud.com</a>)</em></p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Is Yahoo done with search? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/11/custom_1227119193475_DQWindmill.gif" width="340" height="289" />Among the many windmills Jerry Yang tilted at in his brief career as Yahoo's CEO was his devotion to Web search. It veered on an obsession for him. It played into his decision to resist Microsoft's offers to shower him with cash, first for his whole company, then for just its search business. Is it a coincidence, then, that Yahoo's top search engineer has left a day after Yang stepped down? A tipster tells us Sean Suchter resigned yesterday, and speculates that he may be joining Microsoft.</p> <p>If so, Microsoft may have gotten Yahoo's search business on the cheap. Our tipster writes:</p> <blockquote><p>Today is the end for Yahoo Search. Sean Suchter just left for Microsoft. Everyone in the office is shocked. I've been on the Yahoo Search team for a while and he is the one key executive that it all depends on. If Microsoft has convinced him to leave and join them, they won't need to buy Yahoo Search. We will just all join Microsoft anyway. I am definitely going to send him my resume.</p></blockquote> <p>Rumor has it that Yahoo already <a href="http://valleywag.com/5051425/top-yahoo-brain-snubs-facebook-for-microsoft">lost a search executive, Qi Lu, to Microsoft</a>; but Suchter commanded the loyalty of many within Yahoo's search group. These names may not mean much to anyone outside engineering circles in Silicon Valley, but they amount to this: If Microsoft has recruited Suchter, it has gotten the heart of Yahoo's search technology without the fuss of actually buying it.</p> <p>That will please many on Wall Street who want Yahoo to get out of search; the company could save billions of dollars a year in expenses by dropping the business altogether, and serving up search results from Microsoft or Google's index of the Web instead, as sites like Facebook and AOL.com do today. Yang had an expansive vision of Yahoo as a one-stop shop for advertisers where they could buy both search and banner ads. But he dealt the image of Yahoo's search a blow when he tried to do a deal with Google to have the search giant sell some of the ads that appear on Yahoo's search results. Regulators in D.C. blocked the deal, but the damage was done.</p> <p>Engineers like to be on a winning team &mdash; or at least one that's fighting the good fight. Microsoft may be an underdog in Web search, with a pitiable market share which keeps shrinking, but its top executives are obsessed with beating Google &mdash; and they seem more secure in their offices than Yang. Microsoft still has an unsavory image in Silicon Valley, but for coders who have been dealt a drubbing for years by Google, it's an adequate revenge vehicle.</p> <p>Here's the memo on Suchter's departure:</p> <blockquote><p>From: Tuoc Luong<br /> Date: 11/18/08 3:43 PM<br /> To: Yahoo Search Team</p> <p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p>Unfortunately, I have to give some bad news to you. Sean Suchter has resigned. Sean’s last day will be December 19th.</p> <p>Some of you will find this news shocking given that Sean has been a Gibraltar rock at Yahoo and in particular for the Search team. . I understand this.</p> <p>I will point out that we’re on a good trajectory. We’ve released some good products and capabilities and the industry is beginning to take notice. We’ve closed the gap in Algo relevance and making great strides in building the next generation differentiated search experience and step function in relevance – not to mention infrastructure overhaul that prepares us for the future.</p> <p>I came here to take on Google because I believe Yahoo above all is best positioned to take the battle to Google. I think we’re on the right path to changing the tide and would love to see everyone make the journey but I respect Sean’s personal decision. I’m committed to continue the battle against Google as long as Yahoo positions Search to be competitive (and I believe we are). I hope each and all of you feel the same way and stand with me to battle Google.</p> <p>I’ve asked Arnab to step up and take over Sean’s role as head of YST. Just as Sean has been a strong arm for me, Arnab has been a strong arm for Sean. Although Sean casts a large shadow, I believe Arnab will step up to fill the hole with your support. Arnab will cast his own shadow as the new leader of YST and it’s the same YST team that has deliver great products like Search Assist, Secure Scan, SearchMonkey, BOSS, numerous MLR and QRW release to close the GAP in core relevance.</p> <p>Sean and Arnab have been communicating to the YST leaders about the changes. Arnab has been thinking and discussing the new organization with people. He will send out an e-mail describing his organizational thoughts and plan for YST soon. I believe with the support of other leaders (myself, Bharat, Yongdong, Nam, ..etc), Arnab will fill the void and continue the battle with Google. I urge everyone to support Arnab in his new endeavor.</p> <p>Tomorrow, I’ll be holding an all managers meeting to discuss the changes and Q&As.</p> <p>Please wish Sean the best in his future endeavor and congratulate Arnab in his new role.</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Tuoc</p></blockquote> <p><em>(Image via <a href="http://donquijote.cc/">donquijote.cc</a>)</p></em> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ 81-year-old monk has 1,166 Facebook friends -- and a get-rich-quick scheme ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/americanmonk.png" width="211" height="250" />The Internet is relentlessly eliminating the entertainment value of fame in favor of commerce. In the old days, you'd get a publicist in L.A. or New York in the hopes of garnering the attention of some producer or director and becoming a star. The end result: You get rich by titillating the masses. Now, you hire a "social media marketer" in Malaysia to drum up mentions in blogs to increase your Google rank and thereby win more random Web searches. The end result: Increased online-advertising revenues. At least that's what we think is what Burt Goldman, an author and self-described "American monk," is after.</p> <p>Internet fame is not Internet fame unless it can be quantified. Goldman has <a href="http://www.facebook.com/friends/?id=1526171018">1,166 friends on Facebook</a>. 88,390 people subscribe to his blog. And <a href="http://blog.theamericanmonk.com/2008/10/02/on-burts-birthday/">he just turned 81</a>. (If, in fact, he <a href="http://valleywag.com/5086265/we-dont-know-who-we-are-any-more">exists at all</a>.)</p> <p>How did I learn about Goldman? An email from Amir Ahmad, a "relationship marketing and social media strategist" from an outfit called MindValley Labs. MindValley cofounder Mike Reining <a href="http://blog.mindvalleylabs.com/how-i-made-a-dollar-from-everyone-who-watched-my-youtube-video/237/">wrote up</a> how he parlayed a YouTube video by Goldman into $3,400 in sales of Goldman's home meditation product. And Reining, of course, is selling his ability to sell whatever you're selling. On the Internet! From the comfort of your home! (The pity of it all: Ahmad's pitch was so nakedly brazen that it succeeded in getting me to write about Goldman.)</p> <p>This is the future: Why become a celebrity and then wait until your career starts to wane before you start to cash out with infomercials? Why not just go straight to the hard sell? This is the future Google is building for us, with its search results, keyword ads, and countless videos: We will all have something to offer. And you will know us by our sales.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Fire Yahoo's board! ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/yahooboardgone.jpg" width="245" height="340" />After a CEO's ouster, the knives always end up in the wrong person's back. Take how Jerry Yang is being <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122705365756539273.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">ritually badmouthed</a> now that he's out of Yahoo's top job: <em>Such a </em>nice<em> guy. We all loved him. But he couldn't make a decision to save his life.</em> Now, Yahoo's board of directors is being lionized for giving the nice guy the boot, and heroically engaging in a search for his replacement. But aren't they guilty of the same sins?</p> <p>What rank hypocrisy! Where's the blame for tapping Yang for the job in the first place? For not pushing him out sooner? And for that matter, for not having a hot-swappable substitute in the executive ranks when Hollywood dude Terry Semel abruptly quit last year? Those are all grave transgressions to which Yahoo's directors ought to confess.</p> <p>Chairman Roy Bostock should be first out the door. An old-school adman ridiculed within Yahoo as an "empty suit," Bostock has added nothing to the company. And he shredded any remaining credibility by <a href="http://valleywag.com/5091609/newsweek-reporter-yahoo-pr-lying-sacks-of-s+++">brazenly lying to <em>Newsweek</em></a> about Jerry Yang's status as CEO, saying he was firmly ensconced in the job even as the board discussed his ouster.</p> <p>Add to the list investors Ron Burkle, Gary Wilson, and Art Kern, <a href="http://valleywag.com/5021944/the-yahoo-board-members-wed-most-like-to-see-fired">whose ouster I called for earlier this year</a>. Can anyone say what Yahoo has gotten from their collective 26 years on the board?</p> <p>Corporate raider Carl Icahn, too, should make his stay on Yahoo's board brief and symbolic, a prize won for waging a fierce battle with Yahoo management over its failure to sell the company to Microsoft. He may have been right about Microsoft, but I can't believe he has the company's long-term interests at heart.</p> <p>And Jerry Yang, who has been allowed to keep his board seat, should resign it. Yahoo needs a clean break from his mismanagement; a lingering presence will only hurt the company he professes to love.</p> <p>Whoever Yahoo picks as its next CEO should make a priority of mucking out the boardroom; candidates for the job should demand that these six directors offer their resignation before they sign on the bottom line. Otherwise, the job will be untenable.</p> <p>The rest of the board I'd recommend Yahoo's next CEO keep, at least for the time being. Frank Biondi and John Chapple are too new to pass judgment on; venture capitalist Eric Hippeau and Hewlett-Packard executive Vyomesh Joshi actually have knowledge of the marketplace that's valuable to Yahoo; and telecom exec Maggie Wilderotter is a <a href="http://valleywag.com/5033522/maggie-wilderotter-for-yahoo-ceo">credible candidate to step in as Yahoo's CEO</a>, should the board choose one of its own.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Googlers take turns insulting P&G marketers ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/talkingstain.png" width="476" height="356" style="display:block;" />Nothing, it seems, can stop Google &mdash; except the overweening hubris of its employees. Every time Googlers venture outside the Googleplex to demonstrate their charitable embrace of the digitally unfortunate, they end up just reinforcing their snobby superiority. So it went with the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122705787917439625.html">search giant's job-swap program</a> with starchy old-media marketer Procter & Gamble.</p> <p>Tim Armstrong, the Google sales guy who came up with the program, had the best of intentions. Wall Street will keep punishing Google's stock until the company can prove it has another trick besides selling text ads linked to search terms. Television advertising is a huge market &mdash; in the U.S. alone, it still generates $70 billion a year. Google wants a piece of that business. At $8.7 billion a year, Procter & Gamble's TV budget is the largest in the country; who better to learn from?</p> <p>The only problem: A <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122705787917439625.html">detailed look</a> by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> at the program, which had two dozen Googlers and "Proctoids" &mdash; P&G employees &mdash; spending weeks at each other's employer showed the Proctoids learning and the Googlers laughing.</p> <p>For example: P&G marketers snagged actress Salma Hayek for a Pampers promotion, but, to the disbelief of a Googler, didn't invite any mommybloggers. A useful insight: Pampers brand managers corrected the omission. Proctoids also learned how to track the popularity of online search terms. What did Googlers learn at P&G? When a Proctoid presented a 1950s-era television ad, and told them it reached 70 to 80 percent of the audience, they scoffed. That kind of historical data did not fit their algorithm.</p> <p>A fruit of the companies' joint work was a campaign for YouTube users to create spoofs of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_oGKceD-j0">P&G's "Talking Stain" commercials</a>. That's vastly cheaper than running a television advertising campaign; Google, which has hardly figured out how to sell ads on YouTube, foots P&G's bandwidth bill for the videos, and gets little visible in return.</p> <p>Google's Armstrong may have hoped his salespeople would learn how to pitch Procter & Gamble for a piece of its multibillion-dollar ad budget. They were too busy giggling while their counterparts at the staid soap-and-diapers company were learning how to market their products cheaply online. P&G got the beter end of this bargain: It may well save money, but it's not clear Google will get much of it. At that rate, P&G will have the last laugh.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Mark Zuckerberg wants to know how you feel ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/GQfeature12v.jpg" width="240" height="300" />Why have social networks blossomed in as antisocial an environment as Silicon Valley? Because they allow computers to become a crutch for a task most engineers find imposing: dealing with other human beings. Turning relationships into a social graph that can be fed into a database and ruled by algorithms is a genius move for tech's clumsy savants. Alex French, a writer for <em>GQ</em>, <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_7640">interviewing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for a profile</a>, wonders if his cold stare and cagey responses are an incredibly calculating attempt to intimidate, or merely a sign that he's awkward. Either way, Zuckerberg shows a disdain for displays of emotion. Asked if he celebrated Microsoft's $240 million investment in Facebook, Zuckerberg seems puzzled by the question's premise. And yet emotion is at the core of Zuckerberg's plan for world domination.</p> <p>In a conversation &mdash; conducted on instant messenger, the computer-moderated communications mode of choice for the socially impaired &mdash; Zuckerberg reveals that he hopes Facebook will one day broadcast its users very emotions. French probes him on this issue in the following exchange:<br /> <blockquote>(12:25 p.m.) Alex: How’s things?<br /> (12:25 p.m.) Mark: There’s this definite evolution happening. Where the first part of the social web was mapping out the social graph. And the second phase is now mapping out the stream of everything that everyone does. All of human consciousness and communication.<br /> (12:29 p.m.) Alex: Imagine if you could broadcast people’s emotions into a feed?<br /> (12:30 p.m.) Mark: I think we’ll get there.<br /> (12:30 p.m.) Alex: So how are you going to map all of human consciousness and communication?<br /> (12:30 p.m.) Mark: We don’t map it directly. We give people tools so they can share as much as they want, but increasingly people share more and more things, and there’s this trend toward sharing a greater number of smaller things like status updates, wall posts, mobile photos, etc. A status update can approach being a projection of an emotion.<br /> (12:31 p.m.) Alex: That’s what I use it for.<br /> (12:31 p.m.) Mark: So it’s not so crazy to say that in a few years people will be doing a lot more of that. It takes time for people to be comfortable sharing more and for the social norms to change.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Facebook will one day broadcast our emotions.</strong> He's kidding, right? It's easy to dismiss Zuckerberg as someone who watched <em>The Matrix</em> one too many times on late-night cable at his Harvard dorm.</p> <p>Be careful, though: Neuroscience, the study of the human brain's electrical wiring, is one of Silicon Valley's nerdy obsessions of the moment. (Palm founder Jeff Hawkins has a startup, Numenta, devoted to it.) How long before the Bluetooth headsets we wear start listening to us 24/7, using voice-recognition software &mdash; already in use at call centers &mdash; to deduce our mood, and send it to Facebook, which then broadcasts it to our friends? </p> <p>This frightening future may be closer than we think. If he realizes his ambitions, Zuckerberg will know not just who you're poking, but who you're thinking about poking. It would be less disturbing to contemplate this power in the 24-year-old CEO's hands if we had any idea what he was feeling.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Why founders win ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/backtothestart.jpg" width="191" height="204" />Silicon Valley entrepreneurs like to talk about their hopes of "changing the world." Yes, of course: Changing the world from one in which they are poor to one in which they are fabulously wealthy. The question in the air is whether the founders of companies do a better job at creating wealth, for themselves and their investors, than professional managers. With Yahoo announcing Jerry Yang's plans to step down as CEO, it would seem like a losing time for founders. But Yang is an exceptional case; he took his hands off the steering wheel when Yahoo had a mere five employees, and never really ran anything until he stepped in as CEO last June. Most founders of successful startups eagerly seize power, and have to be forcibly dislodged from the driver's seat. The best never let go. Just take a long-term look at the stock market, and you'll see why.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/bigtechstockchart.jpg" width="579" height="335" class="center" /></p> <p>Apple, where cofounder Steve Jobs returned to power in 1998, is up 600 percent since the beginning of 2002. Amazon.com, where Jeff Bezos has reigned as CEO more or less uninterruptedly since the online retailer's founding, tripled its worth. Google, where cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin form a troika with hired-hand CEO Eric Schmidt, has also tripled in value since its inital public offering in 2004. These gains remain despite the stock market's punishing fall.</p> <p>What about Yahoo, eBay, and Microsoft, where founders handed over the company to professional managers? They are all back where they started almost seven years ago. Under former CEO Terry Semel, Yahoo had a brief golden age in 2004, where it outperformed all the other big Internet companies; it ended just as Google began its relentless rise. Meg Whitman overstayed her welcome at eBay, presiding over its stagnation before handing over the CEO job to John Donahoe &mdash; like Whitman, also a management consultant by training. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has proven that he's no Bill Gates; the stock has flatlined under his leadership.</p> <p>Under Yang, the stock has gone down, down, down, interrupted only by the hope that Microsoft might buy the company and in so doing, give its employees the leadership and sense of purpose they so desperately crave. Does that disprove the value of founders? No. Rather, it suggests that by abandoning his company when it was merely a toddler to be reared by strangers, that he was never much of a father figure to begin with.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Jerry Yang and the myth of the founder ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/jerryyang-788359.jpg" width="600" height="402" style="display:block;" />It is one of the most heartwarming narratives of Silicon Valley &mdash; the founder is abused and evicted by the suits and then returns triumphant. But that's not how it worked out for Jerry Yang, <a href="http://valleywag.com/5091503/jerry-yang-out-as-yahoo-ceo">ousted as Yahoo's CEO</a> Monday by a suddenly restive board. Until yesterday, Yang was never much abused by Yahoo's suits; if anything, he was coddled for more than a decade, granted the honorific of "Chief Yahoo" and allowed a say in the Internet portal's strategy. He held a seat on the company's board, and played a role in courting executives like former CEO Terry Semel; but until last year, he never had to operate a business.</p> <p>Experience is underrated in Silicon Valley. Novices are thought to do better than old hands. But the truth is that the intensity of actually running a startup &mdash; raising money, hiring people, assembling desks by hand &mdash; is better training than that provided by most business schools.</p> <p>Looked at that way, Yang gave up way too early, hiring a professional CEO when the company only had five employees. A graduate-school dropout, Yang had no management experience, and no predilection for the task. He is still, to this day, famously indecisive and fatally nice.</p> <p>Steve Jobs has rarely spoken about the heartbreaking experience of being cast out of Apple, the company he cofounded. In June 2005, though, he <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">gave a commencement speech</a> at Stanford University and openly discussed it. "I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me," he said. "The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life."</p> <p>Yang's exit, like his entrance, is far too soft. He will remain CEO until the board finds a replacement; he will remain Chief Yahoo after that. Such kid-gloves treatment does him no favors.</p> <p>For his own good, Yahoo should exile Yang, as Apple did with Jobs, and give him a chance, at last, to prove himself. His golf score may suffer; his nights may prove sleepless. But they say tough economic times are when the best companies are born. Perhaps he'll correct the mistakes he made at Yahoo with his next company. And maybe &mdash; if there's still a Yahoo left to welcome him back, if it hasn't been swallowed up by Microsoft or News Corp. or AT&T &mdash; he'll return to his first company a conquering hero. And prove that Silicon Valley's tale of the prodigal founder isn't so mythical.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ 5 reasons why Jerry Yang is done at Yahoo ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/yangdunce.jpg" width="355" height="400" />Why is <a href="http://valleywag.com/5091503/jerry-yang-out-as-yahoo-ceo">Yahoo looking for a new CEO</a>? Because founder Jerry Yang, in his year and a half on the job, has proven himself incapable of meeting the company's many challenges. Here are five key moments where Yang failed to rise to the occasion:</p> <p><strong>1. The all-too-sacred cows.</strong> When he first became CEO in July 2007, Yang promised that there would be "no sacred cows" and a 100-day action plan. Instead, his efforts became mired in Yahoo's famous bureaucracy; the cows were spared. While the company had layoffs last February, they were not nearly enough; next month, Yahoo is cutting another 1,500 employees.</p> <p><strong>2. The Microsoft deal.</strong> In retrospect, Yang should have taken the $45 billion offer Steve Ballmer made in January and run. With the stock trading below $11, the company is now worth a third what Microsoft would have paid.</p> <p><strong>3. The Google deal.</strong> Google and Yahoo had struck a tentative deal to have Google sell ads on some of Yahoo's search pages; because Google is more effective at selling such ads, the deal would have added an estimated $800 million a year to Yahoo's bottom line. But Microsoft executives, enraged at being spurned by Yahoo, made so much trouble for Google and Yahoo in Washington, D.C., that Google CEO Eric Schmidt chose to walk away rather than accept a deal that would set a precedent for regulating Google's monopoly on search advertising.</p> <p><strong>4. The Carl Icahn insult.</strong> Corporate raider Carl Icahn pressed hard to get Yahoo back to the negotiating table with Microsoft, then tried to unseat Yahoo's board. Yang and the board retaliated with a campaign on Yahoo's homepage which suggested Icahn was clueless about technology. Days after the diss on Yahoo.com, Yahoo's directors relented and nominated Icahn to a board seat. While he's been mostly quiet, Yang's unplanned exit is a sign that he has not forgotten the slight.</p> <p><strong>5. Jerry Yang.</strong> Since becoming CEO, Yang has been pressed for an answer on the most basic of questions: Why should he be the one to run Yahoo? His answers have boiled down to this: Because he founded the company. A <em>Newsweek</em> article last month proved his last chance to articulate why he should be CEO, and he <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/164493">botched it</a>. "Bleeding purple," to use Yahoo's in-house jargon for being passionate about the company, is not enough of a reason. Just because it bleeds doesn't mean it leads.</p> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Jerry Yang's goodbye letter to Yahoo ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/yangout3_01.png" width="260" height="204" />How untidy was Jerry Yang's <a href="http://valleywag.com/5091503/jerry-yang-out-as-yahoo-ceo">exit from the CEO seat at Yahoo</a>? Here's a clue: Tech blog AllThingsD obtained a copy of Yang's all-hands memo before the PR team had sent it to the staff. It must be genuine, since, like the rest of Yang's memos, it completely lacks capitalization. The founders of Internet companies are too busy, it seems, to reach for the shift key. What Yang does not explain: Why, when he took over as CEO last year, he took pains to say this was not a temporary job. His excuse seems to amount to this: The changes he has made at Yahoo are so amazing, so transformative, that it is a "significantly different company" today which requires someone who can "manage this opportunity to leverage the progress up to this point." Translation: Jerry Yang was the right man to be Yahoo's CEO, until he wasn't. The memo:</p> <blockquote><p>To: all yahoos<br /> Fr: Jerry<br /> Subject: update<br /> yahoos -<br /> i wanted to address all of you on the news we’ve just announced. the board of directors and I have agreed to initiate a succession process for the ceo role of yahoo!. roy bostock, our chairman of the board, is leading the effort to identify and assess potential candidates for consideration by the full board. the board will be evaluating and considering both internal and external candidates and has retained heidrick and struggles to help in this effort.<br /> i will be participating in the search for my successor, and i will continue as ceo until the board selects a new ceo. once a successor is named, i will return to my previous role as chief yahoo and continue to serve as a director on the board.<br /> last june, i accepted the board’s request that i assume the ceo role to restructure and reposition the company as a whole in order to more effectively meet the fast-changing needs of both users and partners. since taking on the ceo role, i have had an ongoing dialogue with the board about succession timing. thanks in large measure to your tireless efforts, we have created a more open, competitive yahoo! and we believe the time is now right to transition to a new ceo who can take the company to the next level.<br /> despite the external environment we face, the fact remains that yahoo! is now a significantly different company that is stronger in many ways than it was just 18 months ago. this only makes it all the more essential that we manage this opportunity to leverage the progress up to this point as effectively as possible. i strongly believe that having transformed our platform and better aligned costs and revenues, we have a unique window for the right ceo to take ownership over the next wave of mission-critical decisions facing the company.<br /> all of you know that I have always, and will always bleed purple. i will always do what I think is right for this great company. while this step will be an adjustment for all of us, i know it’s the right one. i look forward to updating you on this process as soon as the board has developments to share, and will continue to do everything i can to make yahoo! fulfill its full potential.<br /> thank you,<br /> jerry</p></blockquote> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Jerry Yang out as Yahoo CEO ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/406px-jerry_yang_free_alternative-203x300.jpg" width="203" height="300" />Yahoo founder Jerry Yang is <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081117/yahoos-jerry-yang-to-step-down-as-a-search-for-new-ceo-commences/">stepping down as CEO</a>, and a search is underway for a replacement after a tumultuous 18 months on the job. Which is curious. In a recent interview, Yang had just told AllThingsD's Kara Swisher, "In this uncertain environment, I think I am absolutely the right person" to lead Yahoo. He must have changed his mind; Swisher reports that the decision was a "mutual" one made by Yang and Yahoo's board of directors. Either Yang was lying to Swisher, or he was deceived about the board's lack of support for him. Executive recruiter Heidrick & Struggles is conducting a search for Yang's replacement. Finding a successor to Yang will be difficult &mdash; not because Yang is irreplaceable, but because he has made such a mess of things that it will be hard to persuade a capable executive to risk their reputation fixing it.</p> <p>There are, nevertheless, some possibilities. </p> <p>One is former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who has been toying with entering politics. eBay and Yahoo have long flirted with a merger, so she's reasonably familiar with the company, and with the challenges of running a large Internet company.</p> <p>A similar candidate: Jon Miller, the former CEO of AOL, who is now a partner at Velocity Interactive Group, a venture-capital firm. Money is tight in venture capital, and Velocity has yet to raise a promised new fund in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars it had planned for when he joined it. Yet Miller has a problem: Time Warner, the parent of AOL, used his noncompete agreement to prevent him from joining Yahoo's board; it's not clear why they would waive it to let him become CEO. The agreement does not expire until next spring.</p> <p>News Corp. COO Peter Chernin does not seem to have much hope of succeeding Rupert Murdoch as CEO, who is expected to hand the media conglomerate over to one of his children instead. But he does not have a credible claim for having much online experience &mdash; overseeing MySpace is the best he can do there.</p> <p>And lastly, as a courtesy, Yahoo's president, Sue Decker, is under consideration. Some say Decker's Machiavellian maneuverings helped out former Hollywood studio boss Terry Semel as CEO last summer. But she's seen inside and outside the company as a bad manager who lacks a vision for what Yahoo should be.</p> <p><strong>More:</strong> <ul> <li><a href="http://valleywag.com/5091545/5-reasons-why-jerry-yang-is-done-at-yahoo">5 reasons why Jerry Yang is done at Yahoo</a></li> <li><a href="http://valleywag.com/5091526/jerry-yangs-goodbye-letter-to-yahoo">Jerry Yang's goodbye letter to Yahoo</a></li> <li><a href="http://valleywag.com/5091589/yahoos-quietly-cheer-yangs-exit">Yahoos quietly cheer Yang's exit</a></li> <li><a href="http://valleywag.com/5091609/newsweek-reporter-yahoo-pr-lying-sacks-of-s+++">Newsweek reporter: Yahoo PR "lying sacks of s&mdash;-"</a></li></p></ul> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Forbes memo confirms print, Web staff merging ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/2008/11/custom_1226952968086_forbesnewsroom_01.jpg" width="340" height="227" />Ending a longstanding internal split that dates back to the days of the first dotcom boom, Forbes Media is merging the staff which puts out the conservative-leaning business magazine and its online component, which run separately and with a ludicrous amount of mutual suspicion and jealousy. (Valleywag had <a href="http://valleywag.com/5066807/forbescom-exacts-revenge-of-nerds-on-forbes">gotten wind of these plans</a> last month.) An internal memo sent by CEO Steve Forbes to staff says that print and online sales and marketing will be immediately integrated, reporting up to an "office of the chairman" which includes Forbes.com publisher Jim Spanfeller, whom rumors had previously pegged as the head of the combined operation. Integration of the Web and print editorial staff won't happen until early 2009. Translation: No one in the newsroom will know what's happening to their job until next year. Here's the memo:</p> <blockquote><p>From: Steve Forbes<br /> Sent: Mon 11/17/2008 2:20 PM<br /> To: undisclosed-recipients<br /> Subject: News </p> <p>We want to let you know of a series of structural changes that will enable us not only to better weather the current economic torm, but to move ahead quickly and profitably when the global economies begin recovering. These moves will make our company highly competitive in an extremely tough environment.</p> <p>One of the benefits of Forbes is precisely the ability to move nimbly and swiftly to respond to our clients and marketers in the way they want to do business. For these reasons we have decided to change the organization of our sales and marketing groups in the company. In making these decisions, we got enormous and valuable input from our own people, as well as the marketplace to best position Forbes Media.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, the sales and marketing groups of Forbes magazine and Forbes.com will be combined into three specific units under the Forbes Media umbrella. The purpose is to enable us to more sharply and effectively focus our resources and priorities in response to our audiences and marketing partners.</p> <p>The first newly organized sales and marketing group is the Brand Intelligence Group. It will focus on the senior-most levels of our marketing partners. We will create consultative engagements with these executives to better connect our highly valuable audiences with our advertisers' core communication goals. This vital enterprise will be led by Kevin Gentzel, as President and Group Publisher of Forbes Media. Bruce Rogers, Chief Brand Officer, will lead the marketing and research arms of this effort. The Integrated Solutions Group, another newly aligned sales and marketing unit, will work to create integrated and custom solutions to access our unique audiences. These original programs will be cross-platform, content-based, with broad marketability. The Integrated Solutions Group will be led by Mike Woods, as President.</p> <p>As always, the core of our client outreach will be our geographically dispersed sales teams. Now, though, we will organize these teams in regional business centers, that combine the talents of the Forbes and Forbes.com sales staff in the newly created Forbes Media Sales and Service Group. This initiative will position the Forbes brand as a true multi-media vehicle. The marketplace increasingly recognizes the necessity to utilize &mdash;precisely and efficiently &mdash; several platforms to achieve their objectives. The group will be led by Avery Stirratt and Robert Pietsch, who will serve as Co-Presidents and Chief Advertising Officers. Debbie Himmelfarb will serve as Vice President, Marketing to support this group's marketing programs.</p> <p>The leaders of the newly established groups will report to The Office of the Chairman, which will consist of Steve Forbes, Chairman and CEO of Forbes Media; Timothy Forbes, President and COO of Forbes Media; and Jim Spanfeller, President and CEO of Forbes.com.</p> <p>I want to thank the leadership of sales and marketing for their critical input in this valuable effort. We believe these bold moves will place us in a far stronger position to expand our historical lead in both print and on-line. In other areas of the company, the following changes will be implemented as well.</p> <p>Conferences and events in the U.S. and Europe will now be part of sales and marketing programs.</p> <p>Recently, the name of the overall brand of web properties and affiliated properties has changed to Forbes Digital. Included under the Forbes Digital umbrella are: Forbes.com; Investopedia.com; RealClearPolitics.com; RealClearMarkets.com; RealClearSports.com; the Forbes.com Business and Finance Blog Network; and ForbesTraveler.com. ForbesAutos.com will be discontinued.</p> <p>We are also strengthening and expanding the editorial integration at both Forbes and Forbes.com. There has been a program to exchange talent between the web and the magazine in place for some time. These efforts have been successful, and we are in the midst of conversations to discuss ways to truly integrate the great talent in both organizations by sometime in early 2009.</p></blockquote> ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ Why Elon Musk could be the next Steve Jobs ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/valleywag/2008/11/muskeberhard.jpeg" width="165" height="250" />When visionaries clash, whose vision do we believe? On newsstands this week, <em>Newsweek's</em> Dan Lyons <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/169161">savages Tesla Motors</a>, the electric-car maker. Tesla was once the brightest hope of Silicon Valley's clean-transportation industry; now on its fourth CEO in less than two years, it's better known for manufacturing boardroom drama than actual vehicles. Lyons writes that Tesla's Roadster is a "classic Silicon Valley product &mdash; it's late and over budget, has gone through loads of redesigns, still has bugs and, at $109,000, costs more than originally planned. Company founder Martin Eberhard (left, at bottom) says that lead investor Elon Musk (left, at top), who recently installed himself as the company's fourth CEO, made costly changes to the car's design and is "a terrible CEO." Musk's retort: "Martin is the worst individual I've ever had the displeasure of working with."</p> <p>Eberhard and Musk have long feuded, even before Musk ousted Eberhard as Tesla's CEO. But I'd note that for once, they're not outright contradicting each other here.</p> <p>It's far more common for Musk to have a version of events that conflicts with everyone else's accounting. His <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/paypal/an-alternate-history-according-to-elon-musk-230076.php">history of events at PayPal</a>, the electronic-payments startup he cofounded, seems to be shared only by him. And Musk has been telling <a href="http://www.thedeal.com/techconfidential/behind-the-money/blog/behind-the-money/elon-musk-on-why-hes-the-right.php">everyone who will listen</a> that SpaceX, his rocket startup, has a "Nasa contract to build the Space Shuttle replacement after 2010." If you ask Nasa administrators, they'll say that's more than a stretch of the truth. (In fact, SpaceX is competing for a contract, but it has only hit some of the milestones; Nasa is currently planning to rent out space on Russian rockets to supply the International Space Station, and a future supply contract for SpaceX is a possibility, not a certainty.)</p> <p>So Musk has a tenuous relationship with reality. Is this a handicap in his business? Apple CEO Steve Jobs is famous for his "reality distortion field" &mdash; a charisma that leads others to believe the most exaggerated claims, because the vision behind them is so compelling.</p> <p>Of course, Jobs actually has brought his outlandish vision to life four times: With the Apple II, the Mac, the iPod, and the iPhone. Musk has realized the Roadster, and SpaceX has managed, after several crashes, to launch one lone rocket. He's also got SolarCity, a startup which installs solar panels on roofs.</p> <p>If in 2011, we live in a shiny future where we drive Tesla cars powered with clean electricity from SolarCity panels, and SpaceX's Falcon1 rockets are supplying orbital space stations, then we will be living in a reality of Musk's making &mdash; much as Jobs envisioned the iPod in the dark days of October 2001, and then, three years later, saw them everywhere on the New York subway.</p> <p>There's another possibility, however, which would also make Musk like Steve Jobs &mdash; the Jobs of two decades ago, who was forced out of Apple by the CEO he hired. Tesla could go under, SpaceX could fail to win the Nasa contract, and SolarCity could get beaten down by rival cleantech startups. And then Musk, driving his Roadster on the lonely roads of Silicon Valley, would find himself facing a reality not constructed in his mind. An unpleasant thought, that. Far easier just to succeed.</p> ]]></description>
