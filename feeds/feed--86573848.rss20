<p><em>Image by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/essjay/88133110/">Essjay in NZ</a></em></p>
<p>
Before I was a blogger I did a lot of public speaking. I did a number of courses in public speaking and used to spend a lot of time with my head in books on the topic.
</p>
<p>
One of the techniques that I was taught that I found to be very helpful was to include something at the start of every presentation that was there unashamedly to grab attention and create interest.
</p>
<p>
The theory was that in most presentations (whether it be in a work context, conference, church, school or even in a social context where a speech was given) the majority of your audience quickly will slip into a zombie like trance even as you&#8217;re getting up to speak. The act of sitting down and listening to someone speak in a monologue is not really something most of us are wired to do.
</p>
<p>
So to snap your audience out of this state where they&#8217;re incapable of comprehending your 16 point presentation the theory is that you do something, say something, show something or claim something that grabs their attention.
</p>
<p>
Whether it be a joke, question, controversial statement or claim, powerful story, funny title slide or intriguing and surprising opening line - the primary aim in the first moments of your presentation is to grab attention and create interest in what you&#8217;re about to present.
</p>
<p>
This same principle applies to blogging in two ways.
</p>
<p><h3>1. Grabbing Attention on a Post Level</h3>
<p>Let me start with the more obvious place that you can (and should) be thinking about grabbing the attention of your readers - within each post.
</p>
<p>
Every time a reader see&#8217;s one of your posts in their RSS feed, stumbles upon it in search engine results, spots it linked to on another site or even sees it on your blog - they make a snap judgement whether they&#8217;ll read it or not. This is based upon a number of factors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The post&#8217;s title</li>
<li>The opening lines of your post</li>
<li>An intriguing question</li>
<li>A Story</li>
<li>The topic being covered and how relevant and useful it is to the reader</li>
<li>Visual cues on the page (pictures, sub headings, comment numbers, page design)</li>
<li>A controversial statement or bold claim</li>
<li>A great promise</li>
<li>The voice and style you&#8217;ve written in</li>
</ul>
<p>
We could probably add a lot more to this list - but I guess the point I&#8217;m wanting to make is that &#8216;grabbing attention&#8217; is something a blogger needs to think about in the writing of each post.
</p>
<p><h3>2. Grabbing Attention on a Blog Level</h3>
<p>While grabbing attention on a post by post level is important there&#8217;s another one that is worth thinking about also - on a bigger picture level as you think about your whole blog.
</p>
<p>
What hooks a first time reader into your blog?
</p>
<p>
Not just into the post that they&#8217;ve arrived on - but to your whole blog?
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not just talking about <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/21-ways-to-make-your-blog-or-website-sticky/">how to make your blog sticky</a> (although many &#8217;sticky&#8217; techniques will help a lot) but I&#8217;m talking particularly about getting &#8216;attention&#8217; of readers.
</p>
<p>
Many of the points on a post level (point #1 above) come into play on this as they will be the first thing that a new reader sees - however there are other factors too - particularly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Communication of Topic - Communicating what your blog is about, who it is for, what needs it will fulfill etc all can potentially hook a reader. </li>
<li>Distinct Site Design and Branding - Whether it be a bold logo, distinct colors, an eye catching picture or some other factor design can stop readers in their tracks momentarily and get them to take a second look at your blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>
What attention grabbing techniques have you tried on either a post by post level or a bigger picture blog level?
</p>
<p>
<strong>PS</strong>: As I&#8217;m hitting publish on this post I&#8217;m reminded of a great little book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Button-Marketing-Emotional-Buttons/dp/B0014JW8XI%3FSubscriptionId%3D02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002%26tag%3Dlivingroom-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0014JW8XI">Hot Button Marketing: Push the Emotional Buttons That Get People to Buy</a>.
</p>
<p>
This book looks at a variety of buttons (or hooks) that marketers use to make customers buy. While this might not seem that relevant for blogging - I found that as I read the book that a lot of the buttons described were similar to what I&#8217;d seen work at engaging readers on my blogs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/stumbleupon-unbanned.jpg" width="275" height="199" align=left alt="stumbleupon-unbanned.png" />In my last post I wrote that I&#8217;d just discovered that <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/08/01/problogger-is-banned-from-stumbleupon/">StumbleUpon had banned me</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce that 1 hour and 44 minutes after posting that - I was unbanned.</p>
<h3>How did it happen? I put it down to Social Media. Here&#8217;s the story:</h3>
<ol>
<li>I had a number of people Tweet me 30 or so minutes before I posted my last post telling me that I was banned. I can only presume it happened around that times they all came at once.</li>
<li>I reacted quickly by first emailing StumbleUpon using their contact form.</li>
<li>I then posted my last post here at ProBlogger</li>
<li>This post <a href="http://twitter.com/problogger/statuses/874309883">appeared</a> moments later in my Twitter stream (this happens automatically)</li>
<li>I <a href="http://www.plurk.com/p/208db">plurked</a> a link to the post.</li>
<li>A few minutes later it was <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/ProBlogger_Banned_from_StumbleUpon">submitted to Digg</a> (something I didn&#8217;t even consider doing)</li>
<li>I received a heap of Twitter responses and the story was re-tweeted by quite a few of my followers</li>
<li>I received a Direct Message tweet within moments fro a follower who gave me the email address of the community manager at StumbleUpon - I emailed him</li>
<li>The post on Digg was at 90 Diggs within about half an hour</li>
<li>Twitter was alive with the story (see this screen grab of <a href="http://www.twitscoop.com/">Twitscoop</a> which shows the tag cloud of what people were talking about on Twitter).</li>
<li>Many readers emailed Stumbleupon</li>
<li>I received an email and a comment on ProBlogger from the community manager at StumbleUpon an hour and a quarter after the post went live. He said that it could be resolved and that he&#8217;d like us to blog about the situation both here on ProBlogger and the SU blog. I emailed back that I would be happy to do so.</li>
<li>ProBlogger was unbanned 1 hour and 44 minutes later.</li>
<li>A few minutes later a story appeared on Digg about <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Problogger_Unbanned_From_StumbleUpon">how I had been unbanned from StumbleUpon</a> - linking to my Tweet about it.</li>
<li>Now that I&#8217;m unbanned from SU the <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/08/01/problogger-is-banned-from-stumbleupon/">post saying that I&#8217;m banned</a> is getting heaps of <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/www.problogger.net/archives/2008/08/01/problogger-is-banned-from-stumbleupon/">bookmarks</a>&#8230;. ironically on StumbleUpon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s that Tag Cloud from Twitscoop</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/twitscoop.jpg"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/twitscoop-tm.jpg" width="540" height="544" alt="twitscoop.png" /></a></p>
<h3>So what did I learn today?</h3>
<ol>
<li>ProBlogger readers and Twitter followers are amazing. Between putting me in touch with the right person at SU and all your tweets, plurks and diggs you got this fixed really quick.</li>
<li>StumbleUpon are responsive - or at least Walter their Community Manager is</li>
<li>Social Media his powerful - while I knew this I don&#8217;t think I really had experienced it working so quickly on something that was personal to me</li>
<li>When you&#8217;ve got a problem it can help to involve your friends, not completely lose it and blog a rant (while I was angry in my post I didn&#8217;t completely lose it - I tried to reach out to SU) and lastly - sometimes there is opportunity in when bad stuff happens. The buzz and traffic around this whole story has been quite amazing today. I think tomorrow I&#8217;ll get banned by Digg :-)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your support, ideas, feedback and offers to help today. Thanks also to StumbleUpon for responding quickly. I look forward to hearing why all this happened and what we as bloggers can learn about it from your end. I&#8217;ll post more about this as Walter gets back to me.</p>
<p>The one thing that I do hope StumbleUpon will learn from and change is their &#8216;banned&#8217; page. It has the potential to unfairly hurt reputations and tarnish sites that have not deserved that. I&#8217;m no lawyer but I suspect it could even border on some kind of defamation.</p>

<p>This morning a number of readers have emailed or tweeted me to let me know that when they try to bookmark a post on ProBlogger that it leads them to a page saying that ProBlogger has been banned from StumbleUpon (thaks to <a href="http://twitter.com/Fussypants">@Fussypants</a> on Twitter who was first).</p>
<p>
You can see a screen capture of the page here - subtle isn&#8217;t it!?:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-2-tm.jpg" width="540" height="194" alt="Picture 2.png" /></a></p>
<p>The page says that we&#8217;ve either been banned for abusing the service or have been asked for the site not to be included.</p>
<p>I can tell you that it was not the 2nd option (and if it had of been I would be pretty upset to see it presented as &#8216;banned&#8217;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sent off an email using Stumbleupon&#8217;s contact form to ask for more information on this - but to be honest I&#8217;m pretty shocked and a little angry at this.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any way that I&#8217;ve abused StumbleUpon and if I had I would have thought that they&#8217;d have banned me as a user of it as well or instead of banning my URL.</p>
<h3>I&#8217;ve got two theories as to why I may have been banned</h3>
<p>1. ProBlogger does get a reasonable amount of traffic from StumbleUpon and perhaps the powers at be at SU think I&#8217;ve manipulated the system to get it. This is not the case and I&#8217;d suggest that perhaps I get more traffic from SU than some other sites because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve written about StumbleUpon many times. Writing about any bookmarking site tends to get people who use that site to bookmark those posts</li>
<li>I write to an audience who use social media a lot - ProBlogger readers are a very social media savvy lot and probably bookmark more than the general web user.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. My recent <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/22/welcome-to-the-problogger-social-media-love-in/">social media love-in</a> and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/271-stumbleupon-problogger-readers/">list of bloggers who use StumbleUpon</a> might have been interpreted abuse.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have checked with SU before running that social media love-in but my motivations for doing it were not abusive. All I was hoping to do was to build community here on ProBlogger and give readers an opportunity to connect with one another in mediums other than here on this blog.</p>
<p>If anything I thought it would promote and build traffic on the social media sites that we developed lists for. If SU don&#8217;t want bloggers to use their service and don&#8217;t want sub communities within their user-base then this is their prerogative - but I&#8217;m a little put out that as someone who has actively promoted and used their service and even <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/08/17/run-a-stumbleupon-advertising-campaign-for-your-blog/">encouraged my readers to advertise on them</a> that they simply banned me.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Some articles I&#8217;ve published on StumbleUpon for bloggers include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/06/why-stumbleupon-sends-more-traffic-than-digg/">Why StumbleUpon Sends More Traffic than Digg</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/08/14/how-to-draw-stumbleupon-users-into-your-blog/">How to Draw StumbleUpon Users Into Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/02/14/how-to-write-posts-that-set-stumbleupon-on-fire/">How to Write Posts that Set StumbleUpon on Fire</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m also a little angry that people voting for my posts get led to a page that accuses me as the owner of this site of abusing their service. If that&#8217;s not a slur against my character then I&#8217;m not sure what is. If this upsets you I&#8217;d encourage you to Stumble a ProBlogger page, click the &#8216;contact us&#8217; link and let them know what you think (that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve asked for on the page anyway).</p>
<h3>Dear StumbleUpon</h3>
<p>I am obviously feeling a little put out by you banning my blog from your service. </p>
<p>I do love StumbleUpon and hope that you&#8217;ll reconsider your decision and I&#8217;d love to hear from you with how I can remedy any actions that I might have inadvertently taken that don&#8217;t fit with your terms and conditions.</p>
<p><b>update</b> - just heard from StumbleUpon&#8217;s Community Manager (who I emailed) - he&#8217;s also commented his email in comments below. We&#8217;re going to work on sorting this out and then I&#8217;ll post about the results in the coming days so we can all learn a thing or two about why this happened and how we can avoid it happening to others. Fingers crossed that this is resolved soon.</p>
<p><b>update 2</b> - 1 hour and 44 minutes after I posted this post I&#8217;m no longer banned from StumbleUpon. I put this down to you - my amazing readership who reacted with emails, <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/ProBlogger_Banned_from_StumbleUpon">Diggs</a>, Tweets and more. I&#8217;ve never seen first hand what a blog community can achieve like this so quickly. Now if only we could pull ourselves together and work so hard to do something that REALLY matters like doing something about poverty or the environment&#8230;. :-)</p>
<p><b>update 3</b> - Check out this post that I&#8217;ve written the <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/08/01/how-social-media-helped-me-get-unbanned-from-a-social-media-site-in-one-hour-and-44-minutes/">full story of how I got banned and unbanned from StumbleUpon in under two hours</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been ALOT of talk around the blogosphere about blog networks lately - ALOT!</p>
<p>Some of it is as a result of the closing of the Know More Media blog network, some of it as a result of AOL and Gawker making changes to the way their networks pay bloggers and some of it is&#8230;. well&#8230;. just because every six or so months there seems to be talk about blog networks.</p>
<p>Today one of my co-founders in b5media (and our CEO) Jeremy Wright put together a post that I think picks up a lot of the themes and casts some light on what it&#8217;s like to run a blog network. Effectively Jeremy has written 6 posts in one (I really have to teach this guy about writing a series of posts :-) )and covers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A summary of some of the talk going on around the blogosphere on the topic with some great links</li>
<li>10 Reasons Managing Bloggers (and Blog Ads) Is Harder Than Your Grandma’s Corns</li>
<li>3 Simple Tips for Starting a Blog Network</li>
<li>Thoughts on Starting a Blog Alliance</li>
<li>3 Tips for Starting a Blog Ad Network</li>
<li>Final Tip(s) for Success for Everyone</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending upon where you&#8217;re at in your own development of blogging I think there&#8217;s something in this post for everyone. <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2008/07/31/10-secrets-to-blog-network-success-2/">Read it here</a>.</p>
<p>Jeremy&#8217;s reasons why managing bloggers and blog ads is hard will be particularly insightful for those starting out with networks because I often come across bloggers who think blog networks an easy way to make money - you simply just hire extra writers and slap more ads on the blogs right? Ummm&#8230;. time for a reality check - my experience of blog networks is that while you can potentially multiple your income with more blogs you also multiple the headaches, challenges, problems and risks.</p>
<p>Jeremy&#8217;s tips for those starting out are also useful.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-style: normal;"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mommy-blog-business.jpg" width="540" height="278" alt="Mommy-Blog-Business.png" /></span></em></p>
<p><em>Today Vered DeLeeuw from <span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://momgrind.com/"><em>MomGrind</em></a> <em>suggests ways for turning a mommy blog into a business. These tips are not limited to mommy blogs: they can be applied to personal blogs in general.</em></span> Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97445131@N00/534982752/">KellyandApril.</a></em></p>
<p><a href="http://momgrind.com/">MomGrind</a> is a personal blog. It chronicles my thoughts and struggles. It is where I share a laugh with my readers, ask for their advice, post an occasional feminist rant, and wonder about the meaning of it all.</p>
<p>MomGrind is also a business.</p>
<p>Unlike marketing and business blogs, or even self-improvement and productivity blogs, mommy blogs are highly personal. They tell the story of an individual, the story of a family. “<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/25/how-to-make-your-blog-more-personal/">Making your blog more personal</a>” is typically not an issue for mommy bloggers. It happens naturally.</p>
<p>When you talk with mommy bloggers, many of them will tell you that they are not blogging for money. Blogging is an outlet for their daily struggles and frustrations. They blog to document the joys and the frustrations that come with raising children. But mommy bloggers are powerful. They have the power to help big corporations reach an important audience. The big companies know it. Do the moms know it?</p>
<p>If you author a mom blog – or any other personal blog – and would like to turn your blog into a business and earn money doing something that you love, these tips will help you get started:</p>
<h3>1. Acknowledge that your blog is a business</h3>
<p>This is a crucial first step. Start taking yourself seriously and others will take you seriously too. If you have an opportunity to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/03/27/how-much-should-i-charge-for-my-advertising-space/">use direct advertising on your blog</a>, go for it, and sell it for what it’s really worth: don’t leave money on the table. If a company emails you with questions, charge a consulting fee for answering them. <a href="http://queenofspainblog.com/2008/03/31/the-business-of-mommyblogging/">Queen of Spain</a> received a consulting fee of $6000 from Disney “for what essentially amounted to a few emails, a survey, and a meeting”. Needless to say, you should set up a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> account.</p>
<h3>2. Decide how much you are willing to share with your readers</h3>
<p>It’s impossible to write a post about mommy blogs without mentioning the queen of mommy blogging, <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Heather Armstrong</a>. Ms. Armstrong has a very particular style that includes great writing, frequent use of profanity, lots of personal charm, and the ability to make fun of herself and her husband. Her definition of privacy is lax – she <a href="http://www.dooce.com/2008/07/25/day-many-many-many-years-ago">readily shares highly private family moments</a> with her readers.</p>
<p>But does one have to use profanity or expose her family affairs on the Internet in order to turn her blog into a lucrative business? I don’t have the answer to this question, although I will venture a guess that if you want to REALLY make it as a mommy blogger, you must be willing to share A LOT. This is a very personal choice, of course. Define your limits, and once you have – <a href="http://badladies.blogspot.com/2007/02/exposed.html">be ready to defend them, to others and to yourself</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Subscribe to ProBlogger</h3>
<p>I am a subscriber and a regular reader. Sure, the posts here are geared toward professional bloggers. But many of them are very relevant to me. For example, Darren’s recent post on <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/21-ways-to-make-your-blog-or-website-sticky/">21 Ways To Make Your Blog Sticky</a> was very helpful in improving MomGrind. I implemented several of Darren’s suggestions, including highlighting my best content and creating an engaging “About” page.</p>
<h3>4. Educate yourself about advertising</h3>
<p>You need to determine <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/04/28/how-much-traffic-should-a-blog-have-before-running-advertising">when to start using ads on your blog</a>; <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/05/10/ad-positioning-tactics-to-increase-your-adsense-earnings-overnight/">where to place them to optimize revenue</a>; <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/09/29/how-much-screen-real-estate-do-you-dedicate-to-ads/">how many ads to display</a>; and <a href="ttp://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/03/27/how-much-should-i-charge-for-my-advertising-space/">how to handle direct advertising</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Start networking</h3>
<p>If you want to earn decent money from your blog, you need to have enough daily unique visitors and page views to attract direct advertisers. Even if your content is great, this kind of traffic to your blog will not happen without networking.</p>
<p>A good place to start is visiting other blogs and making comments on them. You should also approach bloggers who run blogs that are approximately the size of your blog or bigger, and offer to write guest posts for them. This will expose you to new readers, and some of them will end up as new subscribers.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important things you can do to build a community around your blog, is to participate in social media sites. Many prominent mommy bloggers, including Dooce, <a href="http://www.sweetney.com/">Sweetney</a> and <a href="http://badladies.blogspot.com/">Her Bad Mother</a>, <a href="ttp://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/26/twitter-for-beginners-5-things-to-do-as-a-new-twitter-user/">use Twitter</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Keep writing about things that are interesting to you</h3>
<p>While you should keep your growing audience in mind to some extent, it’s important that you stay true to yourself. Writing content that evokes emotions in your readers (Her Bad Mother excels at that), or content that has a high entertainment value (Dooce is highly entertaining), is fine. In fact, it’s more than fine. Don’t worry about other blogs providing information and advice. You are giving your readers something that is just as valuable: you are making other moms feel like they’re not alone, and in many cases, you are making them laugh.</p>
<h3>7. Never apologize for those ad checks</h3>
<p><a href="http://momgrind.com/2008/06/05/when-successful-bloggers-try-to-gasp-make-money/">Making money or wanting to make money from your blog is your prerogative</a>. Get over the “good girl” mentality and be proud of your talent, of your networking abilities, of the wonderful, thriving business that you have started from scratch and are building with your own hands. I enjoyed reading another prominent mommy blogger - Don Mills Diva’s - recent post “<a href="http://donmillsdiva.blogspot.com/2008/07/show-me-money-sister.html">Show Me The Money</a>”. Don Mills Diva does NOT apologize for aspiring to make money from her blog. I couldn’t agree with her more.</p>
<h3>8. Pace yourself</h3>
<p>Creating a successful blog takes a lot of work. If you want to do this for the long haul and avoid burnout, it’s important to slow down. Darren recently said that it’s very easy to work 12 hours per day on a blog, if you don’t <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/27/if-you-only-had-one-hour-a-day-to-blog-what-would-you-spend-it-doing/">set limits</a>. My advice: don’t. This is true for every blogger, and it’s especially true for you, because you have children to take care of and to enjoy. Don’t allow the Internet to rob you of enjoying the fleeting moments of your kids’ childhood.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>36 hours ago I <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/29/blogmastermind-launches-with-bonuses-and-prizes-for-problogger-readers/">announced</a> the re-launch of Yaro&#8217;s <a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/coaching">BlogMastermind Blog Mentoring program</a>.</p>
<p>As part of my promotion of it I offered any ProBlogger reader who signs up the chance to win one of six prizes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flip-Video-Camcorder-Minutes-Black/dp/B0016BXRB6%3FSubscriptionId%3D02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002%26tag%3Dlivingroom-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0016BXRB6"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31OeA62-WfL._SL160_.jpg" align=left /></a>
<p>First prize is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flip-Video-Camcorder-Minutes-Black/dp/B0016BXRB6%3FSubscriptionId%3D02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002%26tag%3Dlivingroom-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0016BXRB6">Flip Video Mino Series Camcorder</a> (worth $179) and 5 runners up will win a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470246677?tag=probloggerboook-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0470246677&amp;adid=1S1SG4K2KRD82XP7CXYF&amp;">ProBlogger book</a>. The deadline to be included to win was 48 hours from when BlogMastermind opened it&#8217;s doors. This is in 12 hours from now.</p>
<p>So - to be in the running to win the Flip or a book you need to sign up soon.</p>
<p><b>What are your chances of winning?</b></p>
<p>To this point I&#8217;ve referred around 20 people to BlogMastermind - so you&#8217;ve got better than a 1 in 4 chance of winning at least something and a 1 in 20 chance of winning yourself a spiffy little new video camera.</p>
<p>Yaro tells me that over 200 people have already signed up - so BlogMastermind is truly cranking again.</p>
<h3>Another Bonus - Get an Hour of My Time If You Sign Up for Six Months</h3>
<p>Yaro offers three options at three different price points to invest in the BlogMastermind Program. For <strong>anyone</strong> who signs up via my affiliate links for option 2 (the six months all at once) or option 3 (the six months plus access to his next course) I am going to throw in one hour of time with me.</p>
<p>You can use this hour in a number of ways (happy to negotiate something that works for you):</p>
<ul>
<li>I can write a short report/review of your blog (I&#8217;d recommend that you have this done after you&#8217;ve been in BlogMastermind for a month or two and have implemented some of Yaro&#8217;s strategies)</li>
</p>
<li>We can spend an hour on skype with each other in a consulting session (again - probably best after you&#8217;ve been in BlogMastermind for a while so you can implement things.</li>
<li>I could write a post for your blog (subject to whether the topic is one that I feel able to write about) or be interviewed on your blog (again subject to whether it&#8217;s a topic that I feel able to respond to questions on)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&#038;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/coaching">Signup for BlogMastermind here to qualify</a></p>
<p>The only conditions that I&#8217;ll put on this &#8216;one hour bonus&#8217; is that you need to signup for BM by the end of August to get it and you need to stay in the course for 31 days before claiming it as Yaro does offer a 30 day money back guarantee (which he honors) so if you don&#8217;t end up paying for BlogMastermind it&#8217;s not really fair to get the bonus.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: This competition is now over. I&#8217;ve chosen winners and will announce them on the blog tonight (my time). The bonus 1 hour consulting offer is still valid til the end of August.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today the Social Media Love-In here at ProBlogger continues with a list of <a href="http://www.problogger.net/145-plurkers-from-problogger/">145 bloggers who use Plurk</a>.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve presented you with <a href="http://www.problogger.net/196-digg-users-who-blog/">bloggers who use Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.problogger.net/271-stumbleupon-problogger-readers/">some that use StumbleUpon</a> and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/538-twitter-users-that-blog/">a lot of them who use Twitter</a>. Today&#8217;s list is smaller than the others but I think it is just as worthwhile as <a href="http://plurk.com/redeemByURL?from_uid=25390&amp;check=-972259875&amp;s=1">Plurk</a> has become a key part of my daily social media interactions and is a place of wonderfully rich conversation and networking.</p>
<p>As usual - if you didn&#8217;t get your profile in the list - all is not lost because these 145 profiles are a great place to start and you can benefit from adding them as they&#8217;re a great bunch of people.</p>

</p>
<p>
The reports that came out of BWE from thousands of bloggers were quite amazing. Rich networking, great teaching, showcases of services and tools for bloggers and much much more.
</p>
<p>
This year Blog World Expo is on again (20-21 September) in Las Vegas.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m hoping to attend this year (I&#8217;m 50/50 at this point as we&#8217;re waiting to see how our new baby settles before I travel again) as the list of people that I know who are attending is quite amazing. They&#8217;ve started <a href="http://www.blogworldexpo.com/speakers-page.html">compiling a list of speakers here</a>. If I&#8217;m going I&#8217;ll be involved in at least one panel and probably another session.
</p>
<p>
I emailed the Rick Calvert CEO of BWE earlier in the week and asked him if they&#8217;d be willing to put up a couple of free passes to attend - he generously agreed.
</p>
<p>
The passes are worth $400 each - there are two of them to go to two separate winners.
</p>
<p>
So here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to give them away - it&#8217;s time for a commenting competition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Before entering</strong> - you need to know that <strong>these passes do NOT include travel or accommodation</strong> they simply give you free access to the conference once you&#8217;re there. Please don&#8217;t enter if you&#8217;re not willing to cover your other expenses or be there as I&#8217;d love for someone to win them that are actually certain to use them!
</p>
<ul>
<li>In comments below I&#8217;d like to invite you to leave a comment telling us why you&#8217;d like to attend Blog World Expo in <strong>250 words or less</strong>.</li>
<li>Rick and his team will select two comments that they think are deserving of winning. They&#8217;ll judge the winners based on your comments.</li>
<li>This will run for one week from the time this post goes live. I&#8217;ll then close off comments and get Rick to select the winners.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Looking forward to reading your entries and the possibility of meeting you in Vegas later in the year!</p>

It&#8217;s a question that I&#8217;m asked a lot - but one that I can&#8217;t offer a lot of personal advice on as my blogs have been successfully hosted on b5media&#8217;s servers for a couple of years now. We use LogicWorks at b5 but I&#8217;m interested to hear who you use and recommend to host your blog?
</p>
<p>
Who do you use to host your blog? Why do you use them?

<p>Signup for the six month package and I&#8217;ll give you a bonus one hour consulting/coaching session with me. Read on below for more details.
</p>
<p>
When he first launched BlogMastermind I was really impressed by what Yaro had put together. He didn&#8217;t just rely upon the fact that he earns a six figure income from blogging to draw numbers into his site - he put so much work into developing a teaching site that delivered students amazing value.
</p>
<p>This has been confirmed to me many times over from the feedback that I regularly hear from students that enrolled last time around. It was so popular last time that Yaro closed the doors on the program so as to be able to give students the attention that they deserved and to stop it being overrun.</p>
<p>
Please don&#8217;t be put off by the sales page (that has to be the longest one I&#8217;ve seen for quite some time - the video at the top is probably the best part) - Yaro&#8217;s training content is first rate.</p>
<p>You can get a great feel for the the type of content that Yaro offers students with some of the free videos and reports that he&#8217;s already released:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/video">Watch his video on Conversion Blogging</a> (the way Yaro makes his money from blogging)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/952/alborz-interview/">Listen to his interview with a former BlogMastermind Student</a> (who now has a blog worth millions)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/video/how.php">Watch two new videos where Yaro gives more insight into how his blogs make money</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.becomeablogger.com">See Yaro&#8217;s Become a Better Blogger Series of Videos</a> (designed for real beginner bloggers)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013">Get the Blog Profits Blueprint </a>(a report that contains some great information on blogging for money)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those five links alone give bloggers some great insights into profitable blogging and will give you a taste for what BlogMastermind is all about and how Yaro teaches.
</p>
<p>
You&#8217;ll notice as you listen to Yaro teach that he&#8217;s not into hype, he declares on his sales page that this isn&#8217;t about getting rich quick, his lessons are clear and that he gives concrete strategies. I know from the numerous times that Yaro and I have met in person that he&#8217;s a genuine guy and just loves to help people learn how to blog.
</p>
<p>
As a result I&#8217;d highly recommend the program and hope that you enjoy the experience as much as I have in the time I&#8217;ve spent in <a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/coaching">BlogMastermind</a>. You can sign up either on month by month basis (getting a taste in the first month) or get the full access to the program all at once for six months at a discounted rate.

<p>Yaro is offering the first 100 students to invest BlogMastermind 3 free bonuses. The bonuses are live teleconferences on three aspects of blogging (using video, website conversion and conversion blogging).</p>
<p>However Yaro has generously just told me that <strong>ALL ProBlogger readers will receive these three bonuses</strong> - whether you&#8217;re in the first 100. You will need to signup using one of the links in this post (<a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;amp;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/coaching">like this one</a>) to qualify for this.</p>
<h3>My Bonus to ProBlogger Readers</h3>
<p>Anyone signing up for the six month package of BlogMastermind through the links on this site (<a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&#038;u=http://www.blogmastermind.com/coaching">like this one</a>) will get a free one hour consulting package from me. You can use this hour either to get a Q&#038;A session with me on skype/phone, for me to write a report of how I think you could improve your blog or even for me to write a post for your blog or do an interview with you on your blog (subject to the topic of your blog being something I feel I can write about). Really we can negotiate on how you use this hour in any number of ways. </p>
<p>I generally charge $150-$250 for this type of session. I would recommend that you use it after you&#8217;ve been in BlogMastermind for a few months and have had a chance to digest the teaching there - then we can use the session to build upon Yaro&#8217;s teaching and tailor it for your situation.</p>
<p>To qualify for this bonus you need to sign up for the six month package of Yaro&#8217;s course before the end of August and stay as a signed up member for at least 31 days (Yaro has a 30 day money back guarantee so it wouldn&#8217;t be fair for you to get your money back AND get the consulting).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://performancingads.com/learn/publishers?origin=285"><img src="http://ads1.performancingads.com/banners/publishers/300pxblog.png" alt="PerformancingAds" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 style="border:0;" /></a>In the last week a new ad network has launched - <a href="http://performancingads.com/learn/publishers?origin=285">PerformancingAds</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bloggers who have been around for a while will know that this isn&#8217;t the first time Performancing have ventured into the ad network space - they previously launched a network back in 2006 but closed it down last year during a period where they when through a management restructure and ultimately were sold.
</p>
<p>I was sad when the network closed last time as I thought it did have promise and love to see new ad options launched specifically aimed at bloggers.</p>
<p>So this week when I was told it&#8217;s back I was really excited.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s How It Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ads are based around the popular 125 x 125 pixel banner ads that you see on many blogs (including the ones you see in ProBlogger&#8217;s sidebar).</li>
<li>It is a self service system where advertisers sign up, submit ads and pay for them all via Performancing and then they send you your share of the revenue at the same time each month.</li>
<li>You can book your own ads for free - might seem a little silly but if you have spare spots and want to fill them with ads pointing at affiliate programs or even key parts of your blog you can fill them with internal ads.</li>
<li>Publishers are put into a Marketplace where your blog will be shown to prospective advertisers looking for blogs to advertise on.</li>
<li>They have a traffic exchange system where you allow other blogs to show their ad on your blog in exchange for credits which can be used to display your ad on other blogs. You also earn credits by selling ads.</li>
<li>The Revenue Share - You earn a minimum of 60% of what the ads sell for - Performancing takes the other 40%. This will be tiered up as high as 90% for publishers for &#8216;better performing publishers&#8217; (not sure if that is based upon sales or traffic)</li>
<li>You have control over where the ads appear, how many are shown and even some control over how they look (like spacing between them)</li>
<li>You can create multiple regions on your blog so have the ads appear in multiple positions</li>
<li>You can filter out ads you don&#8217;t want to appear by adding words for keywords and/or domains that you don&#8217;t want advertisers from</li>
<li>Advertisers buy ads based upon weekly increments</li>
<li>They have a premium program where if your blog has over 250,000 US pageviews per month they can sell ads on your behalf in different size ad units (728&#215;90, 300&#215;250 and 160&#215;600).</li>
<li>You have control over what ads are priced at. You can also set ads to be no-follow ads (or not).</li>
<li>There is a WordPress Plugin to help manage these ads if you&#8217;re a WP user</li>
</ul>
<p>PerformancingAds are new and as with any ad network I believe you shouldn&#8217;t expect too much too quickly from it as it takes time to get them working to optimal levels for both advertisers and publishers.</p>
<p>The success of this network will depend upon their ability to sign up advertisers. Last time around PerformancingAds did manage to sell quite a few ads on ProBlogger - but it took time for them to get to that level.</p>
<h3>Looking to Advertise on Blogs?</h3>
<p>Performancing is looking advertisers at present and<a href="http://performancingads.com/learn/advertisers?origin=285"> are offering $25 off your first ad purchase of $100 or more</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://performancingads.com/learn/advertisers?origin=285"><img src="http://ads1.performancingads.com/banners/advertisers/468pxadv.png" alt="PerformancingAds" class=centre style="border:0;" /></a></p>
<p>Last time Performancing had their ad network I actually used it to advertise my blogs quite a few times. There were plenty of bargains to be had around the blogosphere and it was a pretty cool way to increase the exposure of my blogs to new audiences. I suspect this will be the case again looking at the current marketplace of bloggers who have already signed up.</p>

A week ago today I published a post asking &#8216;<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/21/has-blogging-lost-its-relational-focus/">has Blogging has lost its relational focus?</a>&#8216;
</p>
<p>
It was a post that generated some great conversation in comments and one that sparked other bloggers to pick up on the thread and write about it on their own blogs. Today I thought I&#8217;d point out some of the conversations that are going on around this topic in the hope that it&#8217;ll extend an important topic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Richard MacManus wrote a good post titled <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mixed_messages_blogging.php">Mixed Messages in the Blogging Landscape</a> which picks up the topic and looks also at social media and how it could be impacting pro blogging.</li>
<li>Shel Israel asks <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2008/07/prominent-india.html">if Social Media is becoming a Vast Wasteland?</a> and looks at some of the arguments for and against whether it is.</li>
<li>Duncan Riley writes about the <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1964/the-changing-blogosphere-and-blogging-20/">Changing Blogosphere and Blogging 2.0</a> and has some interesting things to say about a shift in blogging that&#8217;s been going on and encourages bloggers to embrace them.</li>
<li>Mark &#8216;Rizzn&#8217; writes about <a href="http://rizzn.com/blog/2008/07/im-at-edge-of-eureka-moment.php">being on the edge of a Eureka moment </a>and in a longish article shares some interesting ideas including that blogging is in need of an upgrade - he points to video as a way forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#8217;m sure there are others - if you&#8217;ve written on the topic of late feel free to share your links in comments below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PS</strong>: I should reemphasize that in my original article I didn&#8217;t conclude that blogging had lost its relational focus. I did muse about whether it was harder to find and suggest that it is more evident in some niches than others - but by no means have I given up hope in the medium of blogging or its social media.
</p>
<p>
In fact, for me, it&#8217;s so social that at times this little introvert can barely cope!
</p>
<p>
The reason for my post was simply to remind bloggers of our social/relational roots.
</p>
<p>
One of the stimuli for the post was recently witnessing a couple of new bloggers go about attempting to build up blogs in ways that I could describe as anti-social. They came to me for advice after months of blogging in a very insular way, not linking out and not wanting to interact with other bloggers in their niche - in fact they viewed other bloggers in their niche suspiciously and purely as competitors.
</p>
<p>
My counsel to them was to consider that while other blogs might be competitors in one sense - that there was amazing opportunities in interacting and working together.
</p>
<p>
As I look at my own experience of blogging and that of bloggers that have been far more successful than me I see that often it&#8217;s those that are most social and willing to interact with other bloggers that rise the highest. I don&#8217;t see this changing even if the technology behind what we do does.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/200807281643.jpg" width="248" height="259" alt="200807281643.jpg" style="float:left;" />It has been a while since I&#8217;ve run a <strong>group writing project</strong> here at ProBlogger so I thought it might be time to another one (if you&#8217;re new to ProBlogger and don&#8217;t know what a group writing project is I&#8217;ll describe it below).</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m getting things ready I&#8217;m looking for prizes from up to 3 sponsors.</p>
<p>Last time I ran a competition like this we had a lot of prizes and as a result didn&#8217;t give sponsors as much of the limelight that they each deserved - this time I&#8217;m limiting prizes to just the three best ones.</p>
<h3>What do you get for the prize you donate?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll be linked to and have your site/service described in the announcement post of the group writing project</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get promoted with a thank-you to on each daily update through the week of the project</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll be promoted again on the final day of the project and again on a compilation page of all entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all you&#8217;ll be mentioned and receive promotions each day for a week on ProBlogger. You&#8217;ll be one of 3 sponsors receiving this treatment so your exposure will not be diluted.</p>
<p>Last time we did one of these projects we had 893 entries and it got a lot of buzz around the blogosphere. It&#8217;s a great way to get word out to bloggers about your site, product or service.</p>
<h3>What prizes am I looking for?</h3>
<p>Previously we&#8217;ve had prizes that have been anything from trips/accommodation through to Nintendos, to laptops, to cash, to iPods etc. Really anything goes - however if you&#8217;re going to submit a prize idea you need to know the following:</p>
<p>1. the prize needs to be deliverable to people internationally at your cost. Please consider shipping costs or be willing to offer a cash prize to an equivalent value if you can&#8217;t ship outside the USA.</p>
<p>2. last time I did this I had 100 or so submissions for prizes. This time I am only choosing 3 - so those prizes selected will probably be among the most valuable. While it&#8217;s not all about how much the prize is worth I want to give my readers the chance to get the best thing that they can out of participating. It&#8217;ll also get you more attention if you do.</p>
<p>3. please no blog hosting packages or ebooks. While these are relevant to bloggers I get hit with 30-40 or so offers for this type of prize every time. While I&#8217;m grateful to it I find that readers respond well to fun prizes (think gadgets, cash etc).</p>
<h3>How to Submit The Prize You&#8217;re Willing to Donate</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to donate a prize please do so via my <a href="http://www.problogger.net/contact">contact form</a> with the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please include the word &#8216;prize&#8217; somewhere in the email so I can filter the emails and make sure I see them all</li>
<li>Your name and email address (address will remain private)</li>
<li>Your Company/Business/Blog Name</li>
<li>The Site that You&#8217;d want to promote if your prize is chosen</li>
<li>The Prize</li>
<li>The value of the prize</li>
<li>Confirmation that you&#8217;re willing to ship it internationally</li>
</ol>
<p>You have 48 hours to submit your prize suggestion (I&#8217;ll close this at 8pm Wednesday night Melbourne time). I&#8217;ll then contact the 3 that I&#8217;d like to use with further details.</p>
<h3>What is a Group Writing Project</h3>
<p>Put most simply a Group Writing Project is a group of bloggers all are challenged to write a post on a similar theme on their blogs. The themes are broad (we&#8217;ve done things like &#8216;Top 5&#8242;, &#8216;reviews and predictions&#8217;, &#8216;lists&#8217;) so that bloggers blogging on a wide range of topics can participate. Once they&#8217;ve published their post they come to ProBlogger to let us know where it is.</p>
<p>The project runs for a full week. On the first day I announce the topic and then on each day during the next week I publish a list of bloggers that participate. At the end of the week random participants are selected to win a prize. You can see the last project <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/05/07/top-5-group-writing-project/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Initial results show that Knol articles are already ranking very well (<a href="http://www.thinkseer.com/blog/google-knol-is-behaviorally-targeting-ranking-well/2008/07/24">here</a> and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/080724-140223.php">here</a> for example) - and with as little as a link or two from other sites are even capturing #1 search results for certain keywords.</p>
<p>Aaron wall from SEO book has <a href="http://www.seobook.com/google-knol">added more fuel to the fire</a> with some of his own testing.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: What I think irks me the most about Knol is Google&#8217;s insistance that they&#8217;re not a media company. </p>
<p>They host content, they pay those who write it income when that content makes money, they keep part of the money for themselves, they distribute the content&#8230;. </p>
<p>If it looks like a media company and acts like a media company - I got the feeling that they are one. </p>
<p>Of course this is Google&#8217;s right to do - they can set their own business plan - but I guess they need to be willing to be up front about it and name what they are doing for what it is.</p>
<p>They also need to be willing for other publishers (many of them who are their partners in many ways) to react against them. I&#8217;ve been hearing murmurings from a few fairly large independent bloggers and web publishers  today of talk of a move away from using AdSense out of protest. I&#8217;m not sure what impact this would have unless a lot of large publishers did it - but it seems like there&#8217;s growing discontent around the online publishing community around this issue.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you only had one hour a day to blog what would you spend it doing?</p>
<p>A reader recently sent me a question asking how I&#8217;d approach blogging if I only had one hour a day. I can&#8217;t find the email for the life of me (if it was you please email me and I&#8217;ll give you credit) but it went something like this (paraphrased from my recollection of the question):</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have very limited access to the internet but would like to build a successful blog. Can it be done and if so what activities should I do if I can only get online for one hour a day?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a question that I thought would be a good discussion starter.</p>
<p>As bloggers we have many choices to make when it comes to how to spend our time. There&#8217;s obviously a need to write content - but then there are many other activities that compete for our time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>Interacting with readers and moderating comments</li>
<li>Blog Design</li>
<li>Networking with other bloggers</li>
<li>Promoting our content in other places (forums, offline etc</li>
<li>Adding new features</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could (and does) go on. I could (and sometimes do) spend anything up to 12 hours a day online blogging - so if confronted with the choice to do only 1 hour&#8217;s activities it&#8217;d be a difficult thing to work out what to cut.</p>
<p>So how would you fill 1 hour a day on your blogging (or how do you if this is all the time you have)? What&#8217;s most important and what activities do you ignore or put off?</p>

It&#8217;s time to release into the wild another two of our Social Media Love-In lists - this time it&#8217;s all about social bookmarking.
</p>
<p>
The opportunities for collaboration and cooperation on sites like Digg and StumbleUpon are amazing. They can be powerful tools with the potential to drive significant traffic to a blog.
</p>
<p>
One of the keys that I&#8217;ve found to doing this is to have a good base of friends on the sites. As a result the following two lists could be quite significant.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.problogger.net/?page_id=6167">271 StumbleUpon users</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.problogger.net/?page_id=6182">196 Digg users</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Didn&#8217;t make it on the lists?<br />
<br /></strong>Unfortunately we were hit so hard with people submitting their social media profiles that we could only take submissions for 24 hours - however all is not lost if you missed out for two reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m hoping to do this again (it won&#8217;t be for a few weeks as this has taken a lot of work to compile)</li>
<li>If you befriend the above people you can still benefit. I find that when I befriend someone on a site like Digg or StumbleUpon that it often comes back to me with the other person friending me. This is less so on SU where there&#8217;s a limit to friends (200 last time I looked) but there are plenty of opportunities for collaboration even if you&#8217;re not on these lists.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Keep in mind - these people are bloggers - they&#8217;re influencers - they&#8217;re a part of sites that are incredibly powerful and networking with them can be a powerful thing.
</p>
<p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/25/million-dollar-blogger-interviewed/">linked up</a> to an <a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/952/alborz-interview/">interview</a> with an Australian blogger (Alborz Fallah from <a href="http://www.caradvice.com.au/">CarAdvice.com.au</a>) who has built his blog from a hobby to a million dollar business in just two years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not been able to get Alborz story out of my mind since as it&#8217;s a brilliant example of what is possible with blogging - but also resonates with my own story and approach. Today I&#8217;d just quickly like to pull out a few of the threads of the conversation in that interview that I think were important (there were many more but these resonated most with me):</p>
<h3>Passion for Topic</h3>
<p>It is totally possible to blog successfully and profitably on a topic that you have little or no interest in - but Alborz is so obviously passionate about his topic and I believe it is key to attracting a readership who shared his passion.</p>
<h3>Transparency and Honesty</h3>
<p>umerous times during the call Alborz talked of &#8216;telling it like it is&#8217; on his blog. If a car that he&#8217;s reviewing is bad - he calls it bad, whether the car maker is a sponsor of his blog or not. This is another aspect of his blog that I&#8217;m sure has drawn readership to him as they know they are getting an honest review.</p>
<h3>Content Centered</h3>
<p>While Alborz talked of things like SEO, promoting his blog to other bloggers and other promotional activities - he said time and time again that he was mainly interested in high quality content. Even in times when his site disappeared from Google he wasn&#8217;t distracted from his primary task of producing engaging content.</p>
<h3>Exploiting the Weaknesses of Mainstream Media (Light-footedness)</h3>
<p>I loved the way that Alborz talked about taking on the &#8216;big boys&#8217; in his niche here in Australia. He spoke about coming home from car shows and posting news that very night and how the MSM sites would not publish articles for a day or two (either because of their processes or just because they didn&#8217;t work at night). This highlights the power of individual and smaller publishers to break news and beat the large players at their own game. I think the more that bloggers take advantage of the fact that they can do what they like without editorial approval and get content published fast the better.</p>
<p>Once again - a great <a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=782013&amp;u=http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/952/alborz-interview/">interview</a> if you&#8217;ve got a spare 45 minutes or so.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> one other thing that I liked about the approach that Alborz took was that he started out with three blogs on three topics and played with each of them until I worked out which one to focus upon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked about this a few times in interviews lately as being something that I did. At one point I blogged on 20 or so blogs on a variety of topics. Part of this was to see what topics worked and which I enjoyed most. I think choosing 3 topics like Alborz did is probably a better idea than 20 but the same thing applies. In the process of blogging on all three he got a sense for what his niche should be. Once he decided upon a niche he ditched the others and focused in upon his main passion - cars.</p>
<p>I think that this is a great way to choose a topic to write about.</p>

Yesterday I added all <a href="http://www.problogger.net/538-twitter-users-that-blog/">538 Twitter users</a> that submitted their details in our Social Media Love In. It took me a couple of hours to do - but I&#8217;m glad I did it because already there have been some wonderful conversations emerge.
</p>
<p>
As I was adding new people to follow I noticed that there were a real range of people in the list. There were Twitter users with thousands of subscribers and others with 20 or so.
</p>
<p>
Among the list there were quite a few who had literally just started using Twitter in the last 3 days (they&#8217;d started because of the Love-In itself).
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve had a number of these people contact me to ask me where to begin as a new Twitter user. As a medium it can be a little overwhelming to know how to use it - so I thought I&#8217;d put together this list of things to do as a new Twitter User (this is definitely pitched at the beginner).
</p>
<p><h3>1. Work Out Why You Want to Use It</h3>
<p>One of the key things to do early on is to work out what your goal is. It could take a little while to work this out but the sooner you nail down what you&#8217;re going to use twitter for the better. There&#8217;s no right or wrong with how to use Twitter - your focus might be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to use it on a personal level to share what you&#8217;re doing with real life friends and family</li>
<li>to build up you and your blog&#8217;s profile in your niche</li>
<li>to unwind and have fun with new friends</li>
<li>to build up your network in a niche</li>
</ul>
<p>
The list could go on (and it could include multiple goals) - however knowing them up front will help you as you explore how to use it.
</p>
<p><h3>2. Start Tweeting</h3>
<p>One of the things that I noticed yesterday adding all 538 twitter users is that a number of them had only &#8216;tweeted&#8217; once or twice (and a couple had never tweeted at all). I asked one person why this was and they said that they wanted to build their follower numbers up before they started using it.
</p>
<p>
The problem with this thinking is that one of the best ways to build your Twitter network is to be active. Your Tweets are your best advertisement for people to follow you - if you don&#8217;t have any (or many) what reason do people have to follow you?
</p>
<p>
So start updating your Twitter account. Don&#8217;t just write about anything - remember that every Tweet you make can either take you closer to or further away from your Twitter goals.
</p>
<p><h3>3. Start Following Others</h3>
<p>I spoke to one new Twitter user yesterday who told me that the &#8216;Love-In&#8217; had brought them over 100 new followers - but that they&#8217;d increased this even further by finding other interesting people to follow herself.
</p>
<p>
This user had discovered the power of adding followers on Twitter. She&#8217;d invested time into seeking out other twitter users who were Tweeting interesting stuff.
</p>
<p>
This process is a bit of an experiment and involves following people and then seeing if their tweets &#8216;resonate&#8217; with you. Sometimes it means you&#8217;ll follow someone for a while and then unfollow them - but you&#8217;ll eventually find a group of people that you enjoy conversing with. Which leads me to my next point&#8230;.
</p>
<p><h3>4. Get Interactive</h3>
<p>OK - so you know why you&#8217;re using Twitter, you&#8217;re actually tweeting, you&#8217;re following what others are tweeting - the time now is to start reaching out to others and getting a conversation going.
</p>
<p>
This happens on a couple of levels:
</p>
<p>
Firstly it&#8217;s about writing things that others will want to interact with. The best way to do this is to ask a question. People are wired to reply to questions so start asking some. Keep them relevant to your goals and be willing to reply to people&#8217;s answers.
</p>
<p>
Secondly it&#8217;s important to respond to what other people are saying. The &#8216;reply&#8217; feature on Twitter is key and should be used regularly, otherwise your use of Twitter will be quite one sided.
</p>
<p>
After a while you&#8217;ll find that the conversation becomes quite natural as you get to know others that you mutually follow and track what they&#8217;re doing, what your common interests are etc.
</p>
<p>
The beauty of being as interactive as possible with other Twitter users is that you&#8217;re talking to them in public and you&#8217;ll find your other followers and their other followers will chime in and make the conversation a little more multi-dimensional - it&#8217;s a great way of finding new friends to follow also.
</p>
<p><h3>5. Don&#8217;t Spam</h3>
<p>Another thing that I noticed happening with a few of those that I added yesterday is that the only thing they were using Twitter for was to promote their own content. While it&#8217;s possible to do this I wouldn&#8217;t advise it. I do promote my posts on Twitter - but I try to balance them with other natural and organic conversation as well.
</p>
<p>
Another tip is to not just promote your own links, promote others. Keep them on topic and interesting and your followers will thank you for the links that you suggest.
</p>
<p><h3>But Wait - there&#8217;s more&#8230;</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that can be said about using Twitter - but I want to keep this as basic as possible for those just getting into the medium. Start with these five basic things, work on them for a week or so and then you&#8217;ll start discovering your own way.
