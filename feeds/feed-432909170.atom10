			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I&#8217;ll bet you never thought you&#8217;d see the day when you looked forward to moderating your comments, but this might just be it. <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/wordpress-27-changes/#comments">Comment moderation has been vastly improved</a>, with all kinds of little tools and changes to help keep things quick and painless.</p>
<p>The Comments menu of your dashboard has a new, beautiful layout. Above the comments queue, you&#8217;ll see options to filter by Pending (formerly known as Awaiting Moderation), Approved, and Spam:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1431" title="Comments" src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/comments-final.png" alt="Comments" width="775" height="220" /></p>
<p>Below the text of each comment you&#8217;ll find <strong>action links</strong>, which let you Approve, Mark as Spam, Delete, Edit, Quick Edit, and Reply straight from the dashboard. After you&#8217;ve approved a comment, you can also Unapprove. All of these are color coded to help you move along faster than ever.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a section called <strong>In Response To</strong>, from which you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the number of comments displayed in the talk bubble to <strong>filter</strong> your comments view to only show comments on that post or page.</li>
<li>Click the title of a post or page to go to the edit view for that post or page.</li>
<li>Click on the # sign that appears next to the comment count to go to the post or page itself, on your blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>To navigate to a specific comment on your blog, click the timestamp that displays after Submitted On.</p>
<p>You can batch edit comments by checking the boxes that appear next to each title. Then select the action you&#8217;d like to take from the Bulk Actions dropdown.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1421" title="Bulk Actions" src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/bulkactions.png" alt="Bulk Actions" width="775" height="326" /></p>
<p>Comments also appear in the <strong>Discussion module</strong> on the Edit Posts screen. Action links, user info, and a comment permalink all appear here:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1423" title="Discussion module" src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/discussion-final.png" alt="Discussion module" width="562" height="204" /></p>
<p>Action links also appear in the <strong>Recent Comments module</strong> on your dashboard, including pending comments, which display as highlighted:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1419" title="Recent Comments" src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/recentcomments-final.png" alt="Recent Comments" width="382" height="328" /></p>
<p>Finally, you can moderate comments using <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> after enabling this feature under My Account &gt; Edit Profile. Use J to go down and K to go up the rows, and use A to approve, S to mark as spam, D to delete, E to edit, and R to reply.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>As you may have noticed, there&#8217;s a brand new way to post on your dashboard: QuickPress! There are also lots of other tools to help you write and edit drafts and published posts. </p>
<p><strong>QuickPress</strong> lets you post the basics straight from your dashboard, without navigating to the Posts menu. The essentials are all there: title, text, tags, and the media toolbar, which lets you add images, videos, music, documents, and polls. </p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/quickpress-veryfinal.png" alt="QuickPress" title="QuickPress" width="423" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1401" /></p>
<p>You can save from QuickPress as a draft or publish straight away. Posts made through QuickPress will appear in the Posts menu after they&#8217;re saved.  And here&#8217;s a special tip: You can make your QuickPress module extra-long by grabbing the bottom righthand corner of the Content area and dragging it down.</p>
<p>To add a new post the traditional way, go to <strong>Add New</strong> under Posts in the menu on your dashboard. All the modules and screen options on this page can be <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/the-many-ways-to-configure-your-new-dashboard/">changed to whatever suits your needs</a>. </p>
<p>A few <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/wordpress-27-changes/#posts">key changes</a> to note on Add New: </p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy settings and sticky posts options are now tucked under <strong>Visibility</strong> in the Publish module.</li>
<li>Comments, pingbacks and trackbacks settings are in the new <strong>Discussion module</strong>. When there are comments on a post, they will appear here, and can be moderated from within the module. Sending Trackbacks has its own module for including URLs.</li>
<li>The <strong>Publish button</strong> now changes to more clearly correspond to the action you&#8217;re taking. If you&#8217;ve set your post to publish on a future date, the Publish button will change to say Schedule. Posts that have already been published will show an Update button. </li>
<li>There&#8217;s now a separate <strong>Save Draft</strong> button, near the Preview button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on to the <strong>Edit Posts</strong> page&#8230; </p>
<p>You can view your posts in an <strong>Excerpt</strong> view, which you can activate by clicking on the icon in the upper right of your screen. This will display the first bit of your post under its title. </p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/excerpts-final.png" alt="Excerpts" title="Excerpts" width="775" height="411" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1385" /></p>
<p><strong>Drafts</strong> are now shown alongside published posts in the All Posts view, in the order of their modification date. </p>
<p><strong>Action links</strong> are another super-handy addition. They&#8217;re essentially shortcuts that allow you to take action on an item straight from your dashboard. Action links appear on the Edit Posts page when you hover near a post title. These options are: Edit, Quick Edit, Delete, and View/Preview. </p>
<p><strong>Quick Edit</strong> is the counterpart to QuickPress. It allows you to swiftly and easily change these attributes of a post: title, slug, date, author, password protection and privacy, categories, tags, comments and pings settings, status, and sticky post. Be sure to click Update Post when you&#8217;re done to save your changes. </p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/quickedit-final.png" alt="QuickEdit" title="QuickEdit" width="775" height="226" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1386" /></p>
<p>Lastly, you can <strong>batch edit</strong> posts to do a range of nifty things like add categories, change the author, and publish multiple posts at once. To do this, check the boxes next to the posts you want to change, and select the type of action you want to take from the Actions drop-down menu at the top left of the column. Click Apply, and it&#8217;s done! </p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of new stuff, so check out <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/wordpress-27-changes">this Support page</a> for more details on QuickPress and other features.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Back in the day (a week ago), what you saw was what you got when it came to your dashboard. Now, you&#8217;ve got total freedom to move things around and get rid of the stuff you don&#8217;t use.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#move-modules">dragging and dropping </a></strong>modules (boxes of content). Just grab the title bar of a module and drag it anywhere to customize your dashboard to your workflow and style. You can even put all your modules in one column, which will stretch them to be twice as wide:</p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/dashonecol.png" alt="Dashboard - Double-Wide Column" title="Dashboard - Double-Wide Column" width="775" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1372" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#open-close-modules">Open and close</a></strong> modules and menu options if you&#8217;d like to have less to look at, and less to scroll through. To do this, click the arrow to the right of a module or menu title, which appears when you hover over its heading:</p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/dashboardtidy.png" alt="A Tidy Dashboard" title="A Tidy Dashboard" width="775" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1373" /></p>
<p>Like dragging and dropping, this can be done on other pages within your dashboard, like Add New under Posts.</p>
<p>You can also <strong><a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#expand-collapse-menu">collapse</a></strong> your menu to only show the icons, for ultimate minimalism. To do this, click a separator in the menu (highlighted below). Click again to <strong>expand</strong> them and display the text.</p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/collapsedmenu.png" alt="Collapsed Menu" title="Collapsed Menu" width="775" height="335" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" /></p>
<p>Change the settings under the <strong><a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#screen-options">Screen Options</a></strong> tab in the upper right to <strong>hide</strong> info that&#8217;s not important to you.</p>
<p>Clicking Screen Options from the main dashboard will display a list of the modules, which you can then <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#show-hide-modules"> hide or show</a>. In this example, we&#8217;ve hidden columns that appear on Edit Posts</p>
<p><img src="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/screenops.png" alt="Screen Options - Edit Posts" title="Screen Options - Edit Posts" width="775" height="358" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1374" /></p>
<p>There are now also <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> for <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/wordpress-27-changes/#comments">comment moderation</a>. First, enable keyboard shortcuts under My Account &gt; Edit Profile. Then use J to go down and K to go up the rows. Use A to approve, S to mark as spam, D to delete, E to edit, and R to reply.</p>
<p>A final secret shortcut is <strong>double-click</strong>. Just click twice on a comment in the Comments view to open up the editor.</p>
<p>And, as always, you can <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#adjust-editor-size">adjust the size of your editor</a>.</p>
<p>In the coming week, we&#8217;ll be delving in to some more <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/wordpress-27-changes/"> awesome goodies</a> that came along with your new dashboard. Stay tuned!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Howdy there bloggers! You&#8217;ll no doubt remember that <a href="http://blog.gravatar.com/2007/10/18/automattic-gravatar/">when we acquired Gravatar.com</a>, just over a year ago, we intended to fully integrate it into WordPress.com. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but we&#8217;ve finally replaced the WordPress.com avatar system with those <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>R</strong>ecognized <strong>Avatar</strong>s.  What does this mean? It means your WordPress.com avatar can now follow you around the web.  Your avatar can show up on any Gravatar enabled site, regardless of its affiliation with Automattic!</p>
<p><a href="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/picture-2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1155 alignleft" title="picture-2" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/picture-2.png?w=300" alt="picture-2" width="194" height="160" /></a><a href="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/picture-4.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1156 alignright" title="picture-4" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/12/picture-4.png?w=300" alt="picture-4" width="300" height="161" /></a>The old avatar tool in your WordPress.com profiles has been replaced with your current Gravatar (left.)  If you click on that icon you&#8217;ll be taken to Gravatar.com (and automatically logged into your account) where you can easily change your image (right).  You can upload an image from your computer, paste in a link to an image on the internet, or even take a picture of yourself using your computers webcam.  Cropping and rating your images are as easy as ever.  After you finish your new image will automatically attach to your email address (assuming you only have one email address on your account,)  or you will be presented with a simple-as-pie list of your email addresses, and you can attach the new image to any or all of them! Just close the Gravatar window when you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>Of course all of the standard Gravatar features are available to you. Upload as many images as you wish, switch them as often as you like, add as many email addresses as you want to your account, and more features still in the works.</p>
<p>If you find that you have an &#8220;old&#8221; image for your Gravatar, simply click on the link to change it and then click on the &#8220;Use your last WordPress.com Avatar&#8221; link to get the new one back. There are bound to be some small hiccups here and there. Just let <a href="http://support.wordpress.com">Support</a> know when something doesn&#8217;t work quite right, and we&#8217;ll get everything ironed out in no time.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>It&#8217;s 43 degrees outside, which is I think as cold as it gets in San Francisco. But there&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t turn down the thermometer here on WordPress.com.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, the snow is back!</p>
<p><a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2007/12/25/let-it-snow/">Last year we were a little tardy with adding it</a> so to make up we&#8217;re giving you almost a full month of snowy goodness.</p>
<p>How to make it <del datetime="00">rain</del> snow?</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Navigate to Appearance -&gt; Extras.</strong></li>
<li>Check the box next to &#8220;Show falling snow on this blog.&#8221;</li>
<li>Roast some chestnuts.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Oh the weather outside is frightful,<br />
but this blog is sooo delightful<br />
Until the internet gets slow,<br />
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>You&#8217;ve probably gotten <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/27-gets-here-in-two-days/">tired of hearing about it from us</a>, but the day has finally come and <strong>the new dashboard is finally here</strong>. It&#8217;s now immediately available to everyone on WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Change is always tricky, but pretty much everyone who has already switched to the new design and layout (that we affectionately call Crazyhorse) prefers it after a day or two of using it.</p>
<p>Why is that? Well aesthetics are a matter of taste, and you might like or dislike the new look, <strong>but speed is not</strong>.</p>
<p>A big focus of this redesign was <strong>making everything faster</strong>. It loads faster. It&#8217;s faster for you to navigate. And nearly every possible task in WordPress now takes fewer clicks than it used to.</p>
<p>This means we can get out of your way and you can <strong>focus on what matters</strong>: your writing, your comments, your readers, your blog.</p>
<p>So take a few minutes to explore around, there are a <strong>ton of new features</strong> for you. <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/">Try rearranging your dashboard, or your write page</a>. Click the<a href="http://support.wordpress.com/screen-configuration/#expand-collapse-menu"> arrows in the menu</a> to expand modules and navigate faster. Go to your profile and turn on keyboard shortcuts for comment moderation. Poke and prod! <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>For those following along at home, this new dashboard is going to be available as the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">2.7 release on WordPress.org</a> sometime next week. But because we update things so frequently here on WordPress.com, version numbers don&#8217;t apply as much.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.wordpress.com">Support</a> is open</strong> 24 hours a day, 7 days a week if you have any problems, and as always completely free. (Give us a little extra time to reply though, we&#8217;ll probably get a lot of folks <a href="http://support.wordpress.com/contact/">contacting us</a>.)</p>
<p>Love, Matt and the tireless WP team</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>As promised, here is the advance notice that WordPress 2.7 is coming to WordPress.com, and will go live on Thursday, December 4, 2008 at 8pm Eastern Time. That&#8217;s 5pm Thursday in California, 1am Friday in London (UTC), 8am Friday in Jakarta, noon on Friday in Sydney&#8230;<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2008&amp;month=12&amp;day=5&amp;hour=1&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0">find your time here</a>. Some people like to learn how to use new things by jumping right in and exploring, while others like to read the manual first to get the lay of the land. This post is a written version of the 2.7 interface tour/feature review I have been doing at <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamps</a>, and will tell you what’s new in the administration interface of WordPress 2.7. There are a lot of new features, so fair warning: this post is pretty long. If you’re more of the jump-in-and-play kind of person, you can skip this post for now, but you might want to remember it’s here just in case you get confused when 2.7 arrives at WordPress.com in two days.</p>
<p><em>A note on browser capabilities: WordPress 2.7 makes extensive use of JavaScript to create the user experience outlined here. If you have JavaScript turned off in your browser, some features may not be available or may work a bit differently than described here. In addition, using a recent standards-compliant browser will ensure that you have an optimal experience. Older browsers that are not supported by their manufacturers any longer may not look as expected; we recommend <a title="Get Firefox!" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox 3</a> and <a title="Get Google Chrome!" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Navigation</strong></h3>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice when you’ve logged in is that the navigation has moved and changed. Now located on the left side on the screen, the new navigation menu is meant to be more intuitive and flexible as well as saving you a few steps here and there.</p>
<p><strong>Section Labels:</strong> Instead of all your content objects (posts, pages, links, etc.) being grouped under Write and Manage, they get their own top-level sections, making it easier to go directly to the screens you need. Clicking on a section label will take you to the first screen in that section (just as it used to do in 2.6).</p>
<p><strong>Expand/Collapse Sections:</strong> You can see which screens are in each each section by clicking on the arrow that appears when you hover over the menu. Click the arrow again to close the section. If you leave a section open, your browser will remember your setup and leave it that way until you close it. It might be helpful for you to take a moment when you first log in to the new interface and click each section open and closed, so you can see how things are organized.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize Menu Column: </strong>You can also minimize the menu column to increase your working space, which can be especially useful if your computer has a a small screen or low resolution. In the menu column, you’ll see that the sections are grouped, with gray separator lines between them that have small arrows-in-circles on the end. Clicking on these arrows-in-circles will minimize the menu to a thin column of icons. Hovering over these icons when the menu is minimized will display pop-up menus, so even with the menu minimized, you are still only one click away from most screens. Clicking on an icon when the menu is minimized will take you to the first screen in that section, just as the text labels would do if the menu were open.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcuts: </strong>In the upper right corner of your screen, there’s a new button/menu of shortcuts. You can click the button to start a new post, or you can hover over the arrow to reveal other screens accessible from this menu. Click to go to your Drafts, start a new page, upload media files, or manage your comments.</p>
<h3><strong>Customizable Display</strong></h3>
<p>There are several new ways to customize the appearance of your administration screens. These selections, like the menu, will be remembered by your browser, so you only need to set up your ideal screen once on any given browser.</p>
<p><strong>Drag and Drop:</strong> You can rearrange the modules on the Dashboard and Add New Post screens to your liking using drag and drop. Click on the title bar of a module and drag it to the location you prefer.<br />
<strong><br />
Open/Close: </strong>You can minimize modules on the Dashboard and Add New Post screens by clicking on the title bar. Clicking again will re-open the module.<br />
<strong><br />
Hide/Show: </strong>On a number of screens, you will see a Screen Options tab in the upper right. Clicking this tab reveals a layer that lists screen elements and allows you to decide which elements to show on screen using checkbox controls. If you hide a module or column using the Screen Options, you can use the same method to return the element to the screen.</p>
<h3><strong>Dashboard </strong>(Used to be tab above blog title)</h3>
<p>There are two entirely new Dashboard modules, and one that has new features.</p>
<p><strong>QuickPress: </strong>QuickPress, by default in the upper right portion of the screen, is a mini-post editor that allows instant content creation from the Dashboard. You can include a title, body text, media files, and tags in the post, and have the option of saving it as a draft or publishing immediately. For additional options such as adding categories or setting a future publish date, you should use the Add New Post screen.</p>
<p><strong>Drafts: </strong>This module is just below the QuickPress module by default and displays links to your most recent drafts, allowing one-click access from the Dashboard. If you create drafts using QuickPress, they will appear in the Recent Drafts module immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Comments: </strong>The Recent Comments module, located in the left column by default, now includes comment moderation options so you can moderate recent comments from the Dashboard. You can Approve/Unapprove, Mark as Spam, Delete, or Reply to a Comment within the module itself, while the Edit link takes you to the screen for that comment for additional options.</p>
<h3><strong>Posts: Edit</strong> (Used to be Manage &gt; Posts)</h3>
<p><strong>Show/Hide Columns:</strong> You can use the Screen Options tab to hide columns in the table that you don’t want to see. For example, don’t use tags on your posts? Hide the column and give yourself more room.</p>
<p><strong>All Posts Order:</strong> Drafts are now shown in the All Posts view inline chronologically with published posts, rather than being grouped at the end. When a post does has not been published, it will appear in the All Posts list based on the time it was last modified. This means that if you edit a draft and save the changes, it will move to the top of the list.</p>
<p><strong>List/Excerpt Views:</strong> To the left of the pagination links, icons allow you to switch between list view (Title and metadata only) and excerpt view (shows the first paragraph or so of post text).</p>
<p><strong>Action Links: </strong>Action links are now displayed below the post title. Hovering over the row for a post will display links to actions such as Edit, Quick Edit, Delete, View/Preview.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Edit:</strong> Quick Edit will reveal a layer that allows you to edit post metadata without leaving the screen. Make sure to click save in the lower right of the layer to submit the edits. Click cancel in the lower left if you change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Batch Edit: </strong>Batch editing functionality now exists, allowing you to do things like add categories, change author or publish status, etc. to multiple posts at one time. Use the checkboxes in the left column to select the posts you want to edit this way, select Edit from the Actions drop-down menu at the top of the column, and click the Apply button next to the menu. A layer will appear that allows you to edit the metadata. If you want to remove a post from the batch, click on the small X to the left of the title. Don’t worry, this doesn’t delete the post, just removes it from the batch edit.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced Scrolling:</strong> On this screen and others that use the table format, you’ll see that the column headers, action menu and pagination is now displayed at the bottom of the table as well, so you no longer have to scroll up to the top of the screen to access these links and information.</p>
<h3><strong>Posts: Add New </strong>(Used to be Write &gt; Post)</h3>
<p><strong>Customization: </strong>Modules on this screen may be moved around to your liking, with the exception of the title and post editor. You can put frequently used items such as tags or categories in the right column to reduce scrolling, or you can drag all modules to the main column and create a wide layout. Modules may also be opened or closed by clicking on the bar at the top of the module, or hidden using the Screen Options tab.</p>
<p><strong>Comments/Trackbacks: </strong>Checkboxes for allowing comments and/or pingbacks/trackbacks on a post are now both in the new Discussion module. When there are comments on a post, they will appear in this module, and may be moderated from within the module as well. Sending Trackbacks has its own module for including URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility: </strong>Located in the Publish module, the Visibility segment allows you to make a post password-protected, private, public, or public and sticky. Click Edit next to your current status to access these options. Sticky posts are only available when status is set to Public.</p>
<p><strong>Publish Buttons: </strong>Button text in the Publish module has been amended to make actions more clear. If you change the publish time of a post to a future date (click Edit next to Publish Immediately to access this function, the same as in 2.6), the Publish button will change to Schedule, so it’s clear that you are merely scheduling the post, not publishing it now. Posts that have already been published will show an Update button. Buttons for saving a draft and for publishing have been placed at opposite ends of the module, to help prevent accidental publication.</p>
<h3><strong>Posts: Tags </strong>(Used to be Manage &gt; Tags)</h3>
<p>Tag management has been revised to combine on a single screen adding a new tag and managing existing tags. This should prevent inadvertent creation of duplicate or highly similar tags, by showing existing tags on the same screen. A cloud of popular tags also gives a visual indication of which tags are being used the most. Clicking on one of these tags will allow you to edit the tag.</p>
<h3><strong>Posts: Categories</strong> (Used to be Manage &gt; Categories)</h3>
<p>This screen, like tags, combines creating, viewing and editing categories into one screen.</p>
<h3><strong>Media: Library</strong> (Used to be Manage &gt; Media Library)</h3>
<p><strong>Unattached Files: </strong>There is now a filter for Unattached files near the filters for Images, Audio, Video, and Documents. Files that are unattached have an “Attach” action link that allows you to add that file to an existing post or page. When you click on Attach, a pop-up will appear allowing you to enter a search term. The search results will appear in the space below, from which you can pick the post or page to which you want to attach your file.</p>
<h3><strong>Media: Add New</strong> (This is a new screen)</h3>
<p>You can now upload files to your blog without having to create a post first. The upload process works the same it does when launched from a post screen, but now you can go directly to adding media to your library if you want to upload files now to use later. You can use either the Flash uploader or the browser uploader, just as when you upload from the post screen.</p>
<h3><strong>Links: Edit</strong> (Used to be Manage &gt; Links)</h3>
<p>Action links appear on hover below the link name, and columns can be hidden using Screen Options tab.</p>
<h3><strong>Links: Add New </strong>(Used to be Write &gt; Link)</h3>
<p>Name, Web Address, and Description modules have fixed positions, but other modules on this screen may be moved using drag and drop, opened or closed by clicking on the module title bar, or hidden using the Screen Options tab.</p>
<h3><strong>Links: Link Categories</strong> (Used to be Manage &gt; Link Categories)</h3>
<p>The table showing existing link categories and the form to create new ones are side by side for easier link  category management.</p>
<h3><strong>Pages: Edit </strong>(Used to be Manage &gt; Pages)</h3>
<p>Like other screens of this type, on this screen action links are show below the page titles when hovering over the row. Quick Edit and Batch Editing are enabled on this screen.</p>
<h3><strong>Pages: Add New </strong>(Used to be Write &gt; Page)</h3>
<p>As on the Add New Post screen, title and text editor are in fixed positions, but all other modules may be moved, collapsed and/or hidden to suit your tastes.</p>
<h3><strong>Comments </strong>(Used to be Comments)</h3>
<p>This screen has a new layout, and action links appear on hover as with other table-based screens. “Awaiting Moderation” has changed to “Pending,” but the meaning is the same.</p>
<p><strong>Filter:</strong> Above the comment table, there is a dropdown menu that says “All Comment Types.” This menu allows you to filter the display to show only comments, only pingbacks/trackbacks, or all of the above.</p>
<p>Actions: You can edit comment text using Quick Edit, the Edit link, or by double-clicking on the comment text itself. You can now reply to a comment from this screen. Click the reply link and a layer will appear, in which you can type your reply.</p>
<p><strong>In Response To: </strong>The post title links to the editing screen for that post. The number of comments in parenthesis filters the current screen to show only comments on that post.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Permalink:</strong> Above comment text, the timestamp is shown and acts as a permalink to the live comment.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts: </strong>You can moderate comments using keyboard shortcuts if you’ve enabled this feature in your profile. Use J to go down and K to go up the rows, and use A to approve, S to mark as spam, D to delete, E to edit, R to reply.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Threaded comments and paging comments are new features in 2.7, but do not affect this screen, just your public blog. Settings for these features can be found in Settings: Discussion.</p>
<h3><strong>Appearance: Themes</strong> (Used to be Design &gt; Themes)</h3>
<p>No change.</p>
<h3><strong>Appearance: Widgets</strong> (Used to be Design &gt; Widgets)</h3>
<p>No change.</p>
<h3><strong>Appearance: CSS Editor </strong>(Used to be Design &gt; Edit CSS)</h3>
<p>No change.</p>
<h3><strong>Users: Authors &amp; Users</strong> (Used to be Users &gt; Authors &amp; Users)</h3>
<p>No change except that the form to add a new user is now on its own screen.</p>
<h3><strong>Users: Add New</strong> (Used to be Users &gt; Authors &amp; Users, at the bottom)</h3>
<p>This function has its own screen now so that it’s easier to add users to your blog.</p>
<h3><strong>Users: Your Profile</strong> (Used to be Users &gt; Your Profile)</h3>
<p>As always, your profile is also accessible from your linked name at very top right of the screen (Where WordPress says Howdy to you).</p>
<p><strong>Admin Color Scheme: </strong>The color schemes have changed with 2.7, and each color scheme has its own icon set, designed by the winners of our icon design contest. Gray, the default color scheme, includes icons by Ben Dunkle. Blue, the alternate color scheme, includes icons by Verena Segert.</p>
<h3><strong>Tools: Tools</strong> (This is a new screen)</h3>
<p>This screen serves as a place for access to tools that will improve your blogging experience but that you don’t need to access in the administration panel on a regular basis, usually just requiring an initial setup. Currently, this screen includes Turbo/support for Google Gears, and Press This.</p>
<h3><strong>Tools: Import</strong> (Used to be Manage &gt; Import)</h3>
<p>No change.</p>
<h3><strong>Tools: Export </strong>(Used to be Manage &gt; Export)</h3>
<p>No change.</p>
<h3><strong>Settings: Discussion </strong>(Used to be Settings &gt; Discussion)</h3>
<p>This screen has some new settings for comment threading and pagination, in the second group of items labeled “Other Comment Settings.” Use the checkboxes and drop-down menus to enable comment threading and/or pagination if you wish. Note: not all themes have been updated to support comment threading or paging, so these options are turned off by default.</p>
<h3><strong>Settings: Media </strong>(This is a new screen)</h3>
<p>This screen allows you to set default media settings such as image sizes and crop settings.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I’m finally out of new features! I hope this screen-by-screen inventory of the changes coming with 2.7 has been helpful, and that you’re excited to start using WordPress 2.7 on Thursday.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Today&#8217;s post is dedicated to Chuck Norris: the man, the myth, the legend, and the star in our demo of a brand-new feature: Blavatars.</p>
<p>&#8220;What-atars?&#8221; you say. Blavatars! Blog + avatars.</p>
<p>As the incomparable <a href="http://automattic.com/about/" target="blank">Nikolay</a> explains in the video below, your blavatar automatically becomes your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" target="_blank">favicon</a>: the little icon that displays next to your blog&#8217;s URL in a browser&#8217;s web address bar. It&#8217;ll also show up next to your <a href="http://faq.wordpress.com/2006/05/11/how-do-i-send-a-ping/" target="_blank">pingbacks</a> in the comments section of other blogs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To get a blavatar for your blog, just go to Settings in your dashboard and upload an image as your Blog Picture. After you upload, you can crop as you like. Save and you&#8217;re all set.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Howdy! &#8212; or should I say &#8220;g&#8217;day, mate!&#8221; since I&#8217;m in Sydney for <a href="http://wordcamp.org.au/">WordCamp Australia</a>? November was a fun month, and the final month of development for WordPress 2.7 &#8212; coming very soon. It&#8217;s been an exciting process, and we think you&#8217;ll become a big fan of the changes that you&#8217;ll see in your dashboards.</p>
<p>Here are the stats from November:</p>
<ul>
<li>315,405 blogs were created.</li>

<p>You&#8217;ve been checking out WordPress blogs through <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/the-wordpress-app-for-linkedin/">the LinkedIn app</a>: 1,169,596 views were generated by links from your LinkedIn profiles and homepages this month.</p>
<p><a href="http://live.blogs.time.com/">TIME&#8217;s Liveblog Election &#8216;08</a> site, powered by <a href="http://wordpress.com/vip-hosting/">WordPress.com VIP</a>, provided insightful and funny to-the-minute coverage during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.</p>
