&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Everyone is looking forward to reuniting on July 11th at 7:30am for the Atlanta SugarCRM Meetup at La Madeleine - Perimeter. A recent addition to the SugarCRM team and a well known member of the Atlanta software community is Josh Sweeney. Josh will present on two hot topics which seem to be on everyone's mind today. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meeting Topic: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;#1: &lt;A title="CRM Software" href="http://www.sugarcrm.com " target=_blank&gt;CRM&lt;/A&gt; for Social Media - Josh will explore the ability to leverage new &lt;A title="Social Media Tools" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"&gt;social media&lt;/A&gt; tools like &lt;A title=Twitter href="http://www.twitter.com" target=_blank&gt;Twitter&lt;/A&gt; for customer service and support usage while demonstrating his demo integration of SugarCRM and Twitter. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;#2: Building New CRM Modules without Code - Josh will demonstrate how business users can easily use SugarCRM's Module Builder feature to build custom modules such as HR, Inventory, Time/Attendance, or any other type of custom module desired in &lt;A title=SugarCRM href="http://www.sugarcrm.com" target=_blank&gt;SugarCRM&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The meeting will start promptly at 7:30am at La Madeleine located at: &lt;br&gt;1165 Perimeter Center West, Suite 330, Atlanta 30346 &lt;br&gt;La Madeleine Perimeter Location &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I had the pleasure of viewing a demo of iEnterprises Mobile Edge for Blackberry product.&amp;nbsp; This post isn't about pushing some software for a partner, my goal is to relay my experience with this revolutionary product that I confidently feel will increase the sales of any sales person in enterprise software.&amp;nbsp; Unlike other mobile solutions that have mini browsers, this solution includes a small database of records based on the assigned user field.&amp;nbsp; The solution can be easily extended to include new modules such as contracts or cases, so you can quickly reference a clients SLA agreement, support level, or open cases during the actual sales call.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that every sales executive remembers the first time they received a question in the middle of sales call that they couldn't answer on the spot.&amp;nbsp; At some point in time all executives learn that they can't possibly know every answer, and they learn the skill of action item follow-up.&amp;nbsp; Then, there was the first time you used your Blackberry during a meeting or during a break to ask an engineer a question and get a return answer while still at the meeting.&amp;nbsp; At that point, you realized that wireless technology can reduce sales cycles.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, &lt;a href="http://www.blackberry.com/"&gt;Blackberry&lt;/a&gt; wireless apps like &lt;a href="http://www.ienterprises.com/"&gt;iEnterprises Mobile Edge&lt;/a&gt; can revolutionize your access to lead, opportunity, and support data.&amp;nbsp; You will be better prepared before, during, and after sales meetings.&amp;nbsp; More importantly, your team will begin to use your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM"&gt;CRM&lt;/a&gt; solution during the sales process rather than using it as an afterthought on Friday afternoon updates.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/25/iphone-v-blackberry-side-by-side-two-week-comparison/"&gt;Matt Hendrickson&lt;/a&gt; discusses the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; vs. the &lt;a href="http://www.blackberry.com/"&gt;Blackberry&lt;/a&gt; in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; post that compelled me to comment on the topic for those who are travel sales executives trying to figure this whole iPhone mania out... &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/25/iphone-v-blackberry-side-by-side-two-week-comparison/"&gt;http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/25/iphone-v-blackberry-side-by-side-two-week-comparison/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; is cool looking.&amp;nbsp; Fine.&amp;nbsp; However, if you are a heavy traveler who needs email access, please realize that this phone does not have push email.&amp;nbsp; That means that you will need to perform a manual sync or schedule a sync.&amp;nbsp; Having worked with phones like this in the past, it is a battery killer!&amp;nbsp; Secondly, the phone runs on the older version of the &lt;a href="http://www.cingular.com/"&gt;Cingular&lt;/a&gt; data network called Edge.&amp;nbsp; To put it in data terms, we are talking about speeds of 70 - 100kpbs compared to typical modern data networks at 400 - 700 kbps second.&amp;nbsp; When you are trying to send business attachments or via a spreadsheet with phone numbers or status updates, it will not be possible with those speeds.&amp;nbsp; Forget the fun tools, they will not be fun at those speeds either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, hands down, I would suggest ANY phone Blackberry, &lt;a href="http://www.palm.com/"&gt;Treo 750&lt;/a&gt;, etc...as long as it runs on a modern 3G network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What do you do next? Send the raw leads directly to your sales team to qualify? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body" dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn't this like throwing out the baby with the bath water?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of immediately handing leads to sales, marketing should make it a practice to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/lead_nurturing/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0653ab;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;nurture the leads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, setting up a program of activities that provide information on topics of interest to your target and that focus on the value of your solution. Sending and tracking the response of successive lead nurturing activities also lets the lead self-qualify. You can assume that the more information requested, the stronger the lead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body" dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire Post from Jon Miller's Marketo Blog: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/lead_nurturing/index.html"&gt;http://blog.marketo.com/blog/lead_nurturing/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;The post continues to outline the different types of nurturing programs.&amp;nbsp; At SugarCRM, we use several types of nurturing programs, and we have an excellent VP Marketing, Tara Spalding, who really works hard to pull people through the sales cycle via nurturing.&amp;nbsp; I will run through Marketo's nurturing examples and quickly highlight the value of each nurturing example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emails&lt;/strong&gt; – Email campaigns are an excellent way to nurture your buyers.&amp;nbsp; Jon Miller once did a speech back at Epiphany where he discussed how absurd it would be to call up a group of women and tell them that they were analyzed based on their propensity to marry and then propose to each woman.&amp;nbsp; Crazy!&amp;nbsp; Of course, we all take for granted the concept of dating and relationship building in the human world, so the concept of building a relationship via marketing communication and email in this example is no different.&amp;nbsp; After receiving several different emails with each one building on the prior email, buyers feel that they have developed a relationship with the vendor.&amp;nbsp; At this point, the buyers are not ready to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot;, but they do feel that they have entered into a relationship and will be open to listening to further nurturing highlighted below.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newsletters &amp;amp; Blogs&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/"&gt;Marketo&lt;/a&gt; highlights newsletters and blogs.&amp;nbsp; I think blogs are helpful for SEO, but I am not sure how much nurturing they provide to the vendor lead process.&amp;nbsp; However, I think that newsletters are very valuable.&amp;nbsp; Software vendors can continue to nurture via email and direct mail newsletters than contain links to online demos, webinars, and trial downloads.&amp;nbsp; Newsletters are like a monthly table of contents or site map for nurturing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webinars&lt;/strong&gt; – I think Webinars are very helpful for selling products and services that are generally understood by the buying community.&amp;nbsp; However, when Jon Miller and I worked at Epiphany, we tried to educate the market on a product called the Interaction Adviser.&amp;nbsp; It was a product that utilized real-time decision via Bayesian classification to determine the most appropriate offer.&amp;nbsp; Most people were familiar with real-time offers based on using Amazon, but they didn't truly understand how the collaborative filtering used by Amazon was basic product pairing compared to true real-time self learning engines.&amp;nbsp; In any event, the webinars were not very effective in educating the market as the buyers didn't understand enough to register for them in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, with products like SFA and Call Centers, the buying community is very aware of the general concepts and capabilities and really wants to understand the unique differentiators of &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; solution.&amp;nbsp; When selling more commoditized products, webinars are a critical piece to the lead nurturing puzzle.&amp;nbsp; In fact, at high volume SFA vendors like Salesforce.com and SugarCRM, it is safe to say that a substantial amount of the overall sales demo's are delivered via online demos and webinars without the involvement of an actual sales rep or sales engineer.&amp;nbsp; Now, that is lead nurturing at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calls&lt;/strong&gt; – The Marketo list includes calls which is something near and dear to my heart this week as I am performing follow-up calls on leads received.&amp;nbsp; The most effective lead follow-up will always be a follow-up call, but as email becomes more accepted, I am seeing higher response rates with email on a daily basis.&amp;nbsp; However, I find the most effective call program to involve a phone call (inevitably a voice mail message) accompanied by a follow-up email.&amp;nbsp; I always send a short follow-up email summarizing my voice mail as many people don't take down phone numbers and names when they listen and delete voice mail messages.&amp;nbsp; If I had to guess, I would say that phone/voice mail + email follow-up yields a 50% increase in response rates.&amp;nbsp; Now, this increase response rate often equates to someone returning your call or email with a &amp;quot;not interested&amp;quot; message.&amp;nbsp; However, anyone doing prospecting and lead generation will tell you that any response is positive and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Landing Pages&lt;/strong&gt; – I don't have anything to add to the custom landing page overview, so please refer to Marketo's answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="entry-body"&gt;In summary, the post by Marketo lists all the key areas of lead nurturing.&amp;nbsp; There are a also few other programs such as white papers and analyst reports which can further nurture the buyers.&amp;nbsp; All in all, I agree with the post and can speak from experience that lead nurturing is the key to effectively moving buyers through the sales process and engaging sales teams when the buyers are ready to purchase.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
