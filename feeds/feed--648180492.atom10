A study by Forrester research shows that while 83% of companies attempt e-marketing less than 5% are successful.  What's the secret?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://pwebs.net/"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 270px;" src="http://marketing1now.googlepages.com/Marketing-Targets.jpg" border="0" alt="Marketing Targets" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There's no secret, per se, but film and video distributors targeting license buyers need to be informed about all the potential pitfalls.  A good e-mail marketing campaign demands research, strategy, patience, a smooth follow-up process, and a little high-tech. It's hard to know where to begin, and it's natural to be afraid of making a major mistake and alienating your potential buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, a good e-mail campaign has proven time and again to be the most cost-effective way to market, and in the film and video licensing industry, it's becoming a standard and expected practice.  Take some time to analyze what needs to be done, let your creativity and passion for your material inform what you do, and you will reach the film/video license buyers who are searching for the kind of content you offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help get you started, we've put together a list of five easy-to-make e-mail marketing mistakes, and How to Avoid Them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;MISTAKE #5: - E-mailing directly from Outlook This is a very basic mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of distributors use "Blind CC" to send to multiple addresses—this is the trick where you send an e-mail to yourself, and put all the other addresses BCC.  This is a convenient way to reach a lot of people without revealing your whole e-mail list to every recipient (which is what happens when you CC), but these cumbersome BCC messages are red flags for mail server spam filters.  Not only is your message likely going to get blocked, but your entire IP address might be blacklisted.  This means that you will never be able to send ANY message to this address again, unless you contact the hostmaster who blacklisted you and beg for forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools like Listrak, Campaigner, and ExacTarget solve these problems and elegantly handle lists with thousands of names. These services all charge a monthly fee. PHPList and OpenEMM are powerful OpenSource solutions, but require you to provide your own tech support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage of these tools: they track the e-mails you send.  Who opens it, who deletes it, who sends it to a friend, when, and where.  You'll need this data to do follow up, segment your lists, and to tweak your campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MISTAKE #4: - Websites are not doing follow-up for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a user clicks on your perfectly composed e-mail they need somewhere just as professional looking to go next.  An ideal e-mail gets the reader to click quickly.  A landing page (a specially designed webpage for e-mail campaign clickers) doesn't need to be elaborate, but at the very least it should act as a sort of digital sell sheet, offering the extra information a potential buyer needs and makes it clear what they need to do to take the next step.  Add an easy to use 'send us a question form' or invite buyers to sign up to a newsletter and suddenly a passive e-mail recipient has become a real prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MISTAKE #3: - Not segmenting your mailing lists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's tempting to blast one e-mail to a thousand names, but all marketing gurus insist on targeted delivery.  'Segmenting' your e-mail list means nothing more than dividing it into logical groups and sending different e-mails to the appropriate segment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personalizing your e-mails through segmentation can double click-through rates, and becomes more important as you move through the sales cycle.  And by personalization here we're not talking about sticking the prospect's name at the top of the e-mail (though that is a nice touch).  We're talking about changing the content, sometimes very slightly, to help make your property immediately relevant to the prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In future articles, we'll be offering more tips on how to segment your lists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;MISTAKE #2: - Underemphasizing your categories, and overemphasizing your brand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film and video content license buyers receive dozens of marketing e-mails everyday.  To cope, buyers have developed methods to sort and evaluate new titles very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's the first thing a buyer notices when they first encounter your property?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it's not your brand.  A lot of distributors send out e-mails emphasizing their company logo and profile.  While a good brand may help get your e-mail opened, it's not going to help you make a sale.  Buyers specialize in different categories and genres.  They know how to sell that category, where to sell to that category, and who will buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to help buyers understand your title in terms of their favourite categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Segment your e-mail list by preferred category and you will have accomplished the single most important thing to successfully winning a buyer's attention. For independent producers and other rights holders without any brand recognition whatsoever, this is probably the most important marketing advice you will hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;MISTAKE #1: - Not delivering value to your audience with your e-mail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to reach a buyer is to give them tools that will help them 'sell' your title to their buying team. Buyers need to understand all the opportunities your title offers.  Slotting your property into a category is an essential first step, but you can do much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big topic, but the idea is very simple: use the web to show your buyer the audience which already exists for your property. Do your homework, and find ways to position your title on the web where audiences live and breathe the category you are selling. Fan sites, social networking sites, online film festivals, and film/video sites can all take their place as virtual counterparts to tradeshows, press releases, and traditional film festivals, all working as venues to showcase your title.  By creating this context, you help buyers understand how to position and make sense of your property.  It is this context which you will try to communicate in your e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, E-marketing takes time, effort, and experience. Many distributors fear that e-mail marketing is too aggressive, and that it basically amounts to spamming.  If done improperly, this fear is certainly justified. The key is to be in your e-marketing campaigns what you are in the rest of your business life: a consummate professional, whose primary interest is in helping your clients succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Lafleche is the COO of IPEX TV, the leading multiplatform B2B Film and Video online marketplace.

How To Close Sales When Prospects Call" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.ws/2007/11/deal-or-no-deal-how-to-close-sales-when.html"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 277px; border: 0px;" src="http://marketing1now.googlepages.com/feelin-professional.jpg" alt="Feeling Professional" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotions. We all have them. And as marketers we're all taught that you have to appeal to your prospect's emotions in order to get your most-wanted response. When you're selling B2C products like health supplements and consumer newsletters, this is absolutely the truth. But in the B2B world, it's not quite so simple. Here's why…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;B2B Buyers Have Conflicting Emotions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, the B2B buyer has emotions just like the average consumer. Only when you get her over the edge from “I need it” to “I want it” will she make a buying decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she is still an employee of her company. She must take into account her company's needs when making a decision to purchase your B2B product or service. And her company’s needs don’t always jibe with her own. Here's an example of what I'm talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's say Sarah is a software development manager with a medium-sized consulting firm. The programmers that report to Sarah make changes to the underlying software architecture without informing their supervisors. This causes broken builds and missed deadlines. Sarah's boss has told her she needs to buy a change management system for her company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah knows these problems have to stop, and a change management system will help. She has investigated her options and is leaning toward the market leader in the change management space. It's got all the features her company needs and long track record of past success stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;You Cannot Neglect a Business Buyer's Personal Needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this solution is very feature-rich, it requires about 3-4 hours a day for maintenance and administration. Sarah knows her company cannot afford to hire a full time change management person, so the administrative burden will undoubtedly fall on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah just had a baby earlier this year and already doesn't get to see much of her family. Her job is too demanding and overtime-intensive. This causes her to seek other options that might not require such an extra duty, but she just doesn't see any other products that meet her company’s change management needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you beginning to see why the B2B sale becomes so complex?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selling to a prospect's emotions is very important. But B2B sales prospects have two sets of buying needs that don’t always dovetail with one another. You must address both if you are to maximize your chances to sell big-ticket B2B products and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why it's important that you hire a B2B copywriter to understand this dichotomy and can address both sets of needs. Business, as well as personal. Very few copywriters can do both in the same promotion with an equal degree of skill. So when you find one who can, hang on to him: he’s worth his weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll talk more about meeting the B2B buyer's business needs while addressing his personal concerns and emotions in a future post, so keep your feedreader pointed right here at ericlynchcopywriter.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by: Eric Lynch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About The Author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Lynch makes it easy to generate leads for your company's products and services.

Baskind&lt;br /&gt;Managing Partner&lt;br /&gt;Lexien Management Consultants&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="width:425px;"&gt;&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tyZeGOsR9IA&amp;amp;rel=1"&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tyZeGOsR9IA&amp;amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Audiences who saw the fabled Broadway musical, Chorus Line, marveled at the intricate timing and seamless interaction of the dancers as they mastered the choreographer’s precision steps after many false starts in rehearsal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the final curtain, the stage is crowded with dancers whose images are multiplied by mirrors strategically placed about the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s a tough scene to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways one can view the Chorus Line as a metaphor (sans mirrors) for orchestrating enduring major account relationships, which at their optimum, are enduring alliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dance, not of two partners, but of many partnerships developed between business entities. A figurative chorus line of relationships that require timing, integrated movement, anticipation, and occasional improvisation played before a senior management audience expecting considerable return for the cost of the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper direction and judicious investment of resources, a major accounts initiative can become a resounding revenue hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How do you recognize a major account hit in the making?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your product or service is perceived as an integral part of the customer’s business process, i.e. when “you” and “they” become “us.” Bill Voltmer, vice president of global sales for Factiva, the online information aggregator, looks for an integrated relationship between the account team and the client. Bill believes that “when all is said and done, it is the discipline of the account team to have a live account plan which is documented” that drives and sustains the major account relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When account plans are supported by a measurable, systematic approach which functions as an identifiable common language within and between supplier and client organizations.  One method to build the shared planning process is the “Alliance Relationship Model”*, a proprietary process which tracks four developmental account relationship stages, focuses with the client on its business drivers as well as intangible influences and offers a quantifiable measure of the account team’s effectiveness. The model interprets Miller Heiman’s “Successful Large Account Management” guideposts for navigating the major account landscape.  It also helps the account team examine the specifics of relationship development as it relates to the customer’s specific, critical needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the relationship supports a mutually beneficial long term competitive advantage in the form of accelerated growth rates, operating economies and increased market share. Here, the client relationship emerges as a strategic partnership, an actual alliance.  This is a far cry from the predictable transactional steps of a commodity sales process. Clear client communication, focused interaction and a strategic mindset are essential to achieving a distinct competitive advantage for both partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;What are the eight precision steps expected from your lead account performers to set and maintain the tempo of a major account relationship?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your account team leaders should be expected to deliver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Client acknowledgment and acceptance of elevated account relationship&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Definition of the mutual benefits or shared value dimension&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreement on client’s short term and strategic business objectives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identification and commitment of supplier resources in support of those objectives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint client/supplier planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplier and client C-level buy-in and participation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Routine evaluation and re-alignment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Account management continuity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;How to measure account team success?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of a standing ovation, Phil Hecht, global vice president of sales and strategy development for AT&amp;amp;T’s Signature Client Group, believes that “differentiated value” is at the core of a successful major account alliance relationship and the key to gaining a competitive edge. In his view, the value equation includes not only the long term positive impact of a product or service deliverable to the client, but also the value of best practices that the major account team brings to its own company as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equally as important, according to Hecht, are the internal resources available to major account teams. “Owners of major account organizations need a tremendous support structure to feed its sales talent with business intelligence to understand industry dynamics. Given the significant potential rewards equally significant risks, major account leaders need to be particularly vocal about the resources required to anticipate and respond to client opportunities.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Payoff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Financial payoffs to both client and supplier alliance partners can be substantial. Such performances not only reap the loudest applause, they also become long playing hits as they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase wallet share across the client enterprise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contribute to production economies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accelerate product or service innovation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevate sales and account management performance standards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establish vertical market CRM leadership&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gain a measurable competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that's really a touch act to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright 2008 Thomas Baskind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Alliance Relationship Model is a quantifiable major account performance model developed by the author.

But a website does not mean leads, traffic or sales. You need more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To have traffic, leads and sales into your website you need very basic things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;-Content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Links to your site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-To capture emails, names and phone numbers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Patience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you probably heard of having good content, links and capture emails but not patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's talk about every point listed to see what the differences are…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;+++ Content +++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good content will make you a star with the search engines and with visitors. Content is what people and search engines are looking for. The more informative, quality content you have the higher you will appear in the search engines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, don't just do it for the search engines! Visitors and prospective customers also like content. Chances are that's what they are looking for when surfing the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;+++ Links +++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content on its own will not do it. You also need other people with good websites linking to your website. Now, changes are that if you have good quality content many people will appreciate it and link to your website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, just having this great content is not enough, you have to let everyone know you have it. You have to communicate to the online world what you have. How to do it? Well, now it's easier than ever. You can do press releases, have a blog, or two or three (I have 4 blogs) and write articles just like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having links pointing to your website is called "link popularity" and along with content is what search engines like Google and Yahoo look for when listing your website high in their search engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;+++ Capture Emails +++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy one. Now that you get some traffic you need to capture the leads.  Don't just let traffic come in and out. Capture it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best and most popular way to capturing traffic is with a newsletter sign up. You offer visitors a way to get "more content" in your email newsletter in exchange for their name and email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have their name and email you send your newsletter. Don't worry, you don't have to be a professional writer or send emails every single week. You can send your newsletter once per month and it does not have to be long. It can be your thoughts, news, a trade show you attended, a problem you have, anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have about 20 websites that are just one page websites offering a free newsletter packed with information on Marketing or Distribution or Exporting or something like that. They are successful because I back it with very good, free, content like articles, white papers and case studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;+++ Patience +++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the last one, Patience. What do I mean? Well, you will not be #1 in Google under 10 key words or categories over night. Maybe not in 3 months. It can take some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, your strategy has to be short, medium and long term. Your search engine strategy will be medium and long term. You see, the search engines want staying power. Search engines don't want people to take a quick way out. They want you to keep you content and update it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jorge Olson is a &lt;a target="ext" href="http://www.jorgeolson.com"&gt;Marketing Strategy&lt;/a&gt; Specialist educating executives and business owners on Sales and Marketing through his newsletter found at &lt;a target="ext" href="http://www.shotgunmarketing.com"&gt;www.ShotgunMarketing.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get started on the right B2B and B2C &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing&lt;/a&gt; track.

But you might be asking yourself, so what exactly is supply chain management and how can it affect my company?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are Your Supply Chain Management Employees Thinking Domestic or Global?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Global supply chain management has emerged as a major topic in the age of globalization and now it is sitting at the heart of the whole system. But you might be asking yourself, so what exactly is supply chain management and how can it affect my company?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's understand what it is first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the production house the product starts it journey and travels through to the supplier, distributor, retailer and ends at the hands of the consumer. This whole journey is a well managed mechanism and controlled by supply chain management. When it goes global and the journey of the product covers multiple countries, then it is called global supply chain management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With globalization, business has become more complex. Global supply chain management not only mobilizes products but also the entire value added chain, in which financial activities and sharing of information are also included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big companies have many hubs around the world. Raw materials, finished products, finance and other pertinent information travel from one hub to the next. Global supply chain management is the basis of the whole operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of production and profitability is dependent on the global supply chain as well as how well employees throughout the company are trained for such fast-paced tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Global supply chain management has two major components:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. International movement of products and raw materials, title transformation, payments, controlling risk factors 2. In parallel with the above activities, an information network is hard at work. Information sharing and collecting is very important to run an effective global supply chain management system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The efficiency of the global supply chain management of any company can make everything look easy. However in order to attain those efficiencies your employees need to understand the fundamentals.  The most basic fundamental is that supply chain management is not just domestic anymore nor is it just for large corporations.  Small and midsize companies have to be global supply chain management savvy if they wish to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The growth and development of a company is largely dependent on the global supply chain management system and its most important asset - employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are your employees top-notch when it comes to global supply chain skills? If you can’t answer yes then you better start thinking about training because your competitors are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what type of training is needed company wide?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, introduce employees to global supply chain management. Don't assume they grasp the concept.  With increased globalization and offshore sourcing, global supply chain management is becoming an important issue for many businesses. So, make sure the foundation is laid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, employees should learn the underlying factors behind the trend to reducing the cost of procurement and decreasing the risks related to purchasing activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, they should understand the following principles: a) competition is no longer among independent companies but instead about connected supply chains b) supply chain competition is global c) winners will be companies that best integrate and achieve commitment to supply chain excellence among diverse organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright &amp;#169; 2007 Sherry Harris&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherry Harris is the President and CEO of online career training school, Malibu Institute.

The difficulties apply to commercial real estate investment property loans, business cash advance situations and business opportunity financing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 align="center"&gt;Commercial Loan and Business Financing - Unusual Problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a surprising number of problems which should be anticipated when arranging a commercial loan. Several of these potential business financing difficulties are relatively unknown by most borrowers. These issues are relevant for commercial real estate financing, business opportunity investment loans and business cash advance circumstances, although not all factors will apply to each situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Commercial Loan Advisory Reports -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have published separate commercial loan advisory reports which provide a comprehensive discussion of the major problems likely to be encountered in typical business financing and commercial real estate loan circumstances. For example, one report focuses on common business opportunity investment financing difficulties. In another report, we discussed the obstacles usually experienced with SBA loan refinancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Black Ice Analogy: Unseen Business Financing Problems -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The focus in this article is to highlight several of the more obscure commercial loan problems. We consider these often hidden business financing difficulties to be of critical importance to a commercial borrower. Drivers familiar with an extremely hazardous road condition known as black ice (in which ice is largely invisible on the road) will readily appreciate that unknown and unseen business finance problems can be particularly hazardous to the financial health of a business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Online Business Finance Applications -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first relatively unknown business financing problem involves the increasing use of internet technology by commercial lenders. Many commercial loan sites encourage borrowers to submit an online application. This is not a prudent way for a business owner to proceed with their commercial financing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important that business owners understand that it is not in their best interest to submit an online business financing application. For a more detailed understanding of why an online commercial loan application is inadvisable and how to proceed in a search for viable financing, borrowers should review the report entitled How and Why to Avoid the Online Business Loan Application Trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Recall Provisions for a Commercial Mortgage -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next obscure but nevertheless serious business financing problem to anticipate involves the use of loan recall terms by a lender. Commercial loan recall covenants mean that the lender can force the borrower to repay early by calling the loan before it would normally expire. Many traditional commercial lenders routinely place recall clauses in their commercial mortgage conditions, but this potential concern is not applicable to all borrowers since some financing agreements will not allow a loan recall possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circumstances which can cause a recall will vary but can commonly include periodic lender review of financial statements, tax returns and credit history. If prescribed levels of income, credit scores or other benchmarks are not present, then the lender will typically notify the commercial borrower that they must pay off the loan within a 30-90 day period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a commercial loan recall, borrowers will need to refinance quickly. Prudent borrowers will exclude lenders that require recall agreements when evaluating business financing options. For commercial borrowers who have recall provisions in their current business loan agreement, it will be equally wise to consider refinancing their commercial mortgage before a recall occurs so that refinancing is accomplished according to the preferred timetable of the business owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Balloon Payments and Short-term Business Loans -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another often overlooked commercial financing problem is the increasing emphasis on short-term financing by many commercial lenders. How long is a long-term commercial loan? Most business financing experts will advise a minimum loan period varying from 10 years to 30 years depending on the specific circumstances of the borrower. Unfortunately many business lenders often consider three years as the maximum period before a balloon payment will be due for a commercial mortgage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a balloon payment condition, a business owner will be required to either pay the remaining loan balance or refinance. This kind of loan is a short-term commercial loan instead of long-term and should be avoided whenever feasible. Longer-term business financing will often be the critical difference that facilitates a successful business investment because new financing will not be required for many years and business loan payments will usually be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Inexperienced Commercial Real Estate Loan Lenders and Advisers -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final example of a problem that is not obvious to most commercial borrowers involves a shortage of business loan experts providing candid advice to business owners. The process of business investing and business financing has become more specialized during the past few years. There have been some recent real estate and business investment developments that have made this process even more complicated. The current turmoil in residential real estate investment property has resulted in an increasing number of residential lenders and advisers attempting to become active in commercial loan activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an almost impossible transition for most residential lenders and advisers. There are over 25 critical differences between residential and commercial property investing. As a result, these new and inexperienced commercial financing advisers frequently provide woefully inadequate advice and potentially disastrous business financing for their clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;How to Avoid These and Other Commercial Financing Problems -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can commercial borrowers do to avoid a similar fate? A pragmatic approach is to explore additional resources that will facilitate a better understanding of complex business finance issues. The Commercial Real Estate Investment Property Loan and Business Finance Guide is one example of business financing resources that will provide strategies and solutions for many problematic commercial loan circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Bush and AEX Commercial Financing Group provide &lt;a target="ext" href="http://www.working-capital-management.org/"&gt;business finance - commercial real estate loan&lt;/a&gt; help and &lt;a target="ext" href="http://www.real-estate-investment-property.com/"&gt;AEX Investment Commercial Loan - Commercial Mortgage&lt;/a&gt; Reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now is the time to invest in &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing&lt;/a&gt; solutions.

They are spending much more time on the Internet searching out everything. Read more about this at the article: &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/marketing/2006/12/challenges-facing-businesses.php"&gt;Challenges Facing Businesses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The importance of understanding this relationship between the Internet and any business today must be grasped for both large and small companies. The idea that if a company does not do e-commerce directly online through what some would view the traditional meaning of B2B and B2C is totally a false pretense today. The Internet has broken down that barrier and created a situation where every business today could be classified under B2B or B2C for 99% of the companies. There is another C2C designation that represents Consumer-to-consumer or Consumer-to-customer in which private individuals are selling items of value to other consumers via eBay and Craigslist type environments. Actually some of these C2C individuals have developed a marketing plan that is better then their counterparts in B2B or B2C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get started with good &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional Web Services provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/Internet_Marketing_Services.html"&gt;Internet marketing services,&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/searchengineoptimization.htm"&gt;ethical search engine optimization,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://advertising.pwebs.net/ads"&gt;online advertising strategies,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/branding/"&gt;Web branding solutions.&lt;/a&gt; Contact Professional Web Services for a &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/b2b_b2c_sales_marketing_advertising_professional_web_services_strategies_solutions.htm"&gt;free Internet marketing evaluation&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc., provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services&lt;/a&gt; ethical search engine optimization, online advertising strategies, and Web branding solutions for B2B and B2C companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/feeds/116690127141750012/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8533321&amp;postID=116690127141750012' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/116690127141750012'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/116690127141750012'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2006/12/challenges-of-b2b-and-b2c.html' title='The Challenges Of B2B And B2C'/><author><name>James A.

The B2C distinction is important from the perspective of understanding the consumer buying habits and online searched for terms related to your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, we are all consumers. We buy clothes, food, washers, dryers, refrigerators, televisions, automobiles, and homes. As consumers we also purchase services; such as: real estate, legal, accounting, and interior design services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While consumer purchases are probably obvious to you and you know exactly how to go about finding the best deals or top quality services online, not everyone searches the same way or even speaks the same English language even though everyone in your target marketing group may speak English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an owner of a Small Business or a Large Corporation it is very important from an Online perspective that you are targeting the right keywords for your website. This is sometimes where a certain amount of pride must be swallowed by the business owner to include the keywords, that consumers are searching for the things you sell. Owners typically have little nuances of certain words that they feel do not fit their brands. However, by not including those keywords in the body text of a website a large market segment is excluded from ever finding the B2C website in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It amazes me sometimes, of some of the inquiries that we have received at &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Professional Web Services&lt;/a&gt; for helping out potential customers with optimizing, marketing, and advertising their websites. Each particular consumer product or service industry has its own unique language that must be analyzed, deciphered, and optimized for the targeted audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marketing Focus Groups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research is the key to understanding your markets. This however can be very costly for the Small Business Owner to contract out to an organization to run a &lt;a target="ext" href="http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/resources/marketing/market_research/dos_and_donts_for_using_marketing_focus_groups.mspx"&gt;Marketing Focus Group.&lt;/a&gt; But, if you are willing to listen to others, and simply ask some simple questions in regards to the products or services your business sells, then it doesn't necessarily have to be costly. Marketing insights for keyword development can be ascertained by asking individuals, how they would search online for the product you sell? What keywords would they use? If you really wanted to keep it as unbiased as possible then simply show the picture of the product or service instead of describing it with your words. The old saying, "A Picture Tells a Thousand Words" certainly will ring true when individuals look at the picture and decide on their own, of how they would search online and what search queries would be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; border: 0;" src="http://advertising.pwebs.net/uploaded_images/keywords-search-726005.gif" alt="Keywords Search" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The consumer e research involved with this keyword aspect of marketing needs to be incorporated within the structure of the organization. For example, it is not enough that the owner or president of a company understand the keywords searched for, but the &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet Marketing Service&lt;/a&gt; provider or the in-house SEO, Search Engine Optimization individual must be in-tune with all of the marketing research in order to best optimize the website for keywords used by consumers in a particular market place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are online tools that are helpful in determining what keywords are being searched for regularly, and provide additional helpful suggestions for other variations of the searched for keywords. If you were to set up a Google AdWords account for Online advertising, they also have a keywords research tool built into the system for targeting other searched for keywords. This same information can be used to help develop the website to the maximum potential for keyword targeting a select group of consumers. See: &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/marketing/articles/internetmarketing_ppcadvertising.htm"&gt;Internet Marketing And PPC Advertising Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is your Focus Group: B2B, B2C, or C2C?

But it was the Internet that really put B2B And B2C on the map. For that matter, it also built the C2C landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is B2B, B2C, and C2C?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; width: 120px; padding: 5px 10px 0 0;"&gt;&lt;object width="120" height="600"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://pwebs.net/flash-marketing.swf"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://pwebs.net/flash-marketing.swf" width="120" height="600"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B2B refers to Business-to-business, B2C is Business-to-consumer, and C2C represents Consumer-to-consumer. These terms have all been popularized by the World Wide Web with no built-in boundaries for commerce and e-Business sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marketing Classifications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every company brand could be classified under at least one of the three with many companies selling to both B2B and B2C classifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some countries use BtoB, BtoC, and CtoC to represent the exact same thing. The really interesting thing about all six of these U.S. English Acronyms is that other countries have adopted and even use the terms in their own written languages to communicate to their readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sales Online&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early technology days of the Internet these three terms represented a very narrow spectrum of eCommerce branded companies that were exclusively doing online sales to other businesses or consumers. Now with affordable Internet technology capabilities of anyone or any business having an online eCommerce shopping cart built into their website the broader description is a much more accurate description. That is, defining it as, any website or company that is marketing &amp; advertising their products or branded services online to other consumers and businesses is said to be &lt;a name="b2b"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BtoB, &lt;a name="b2c"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BtoC, Or &lt;a name="c2c"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;CtoC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many &lt;a href="http://www.pwebs.net/b2b_b2c_marketing_and_advertising_resources_information.htm#Marketing_differences_between_B2C_and_B2B"&gt;excellent articles&lt;/a&gt; written online about the differences between B2B &amp;amp; B2C sales. But, if I had to sum it up, the biggest difference in the two is the time frame from start of a sale to the close of a sale. Typically &lt;b&gt;B2B&lt;/b&gt; requires more time than &lt;b&gt;B2C&lt;/b&gt; though there are exceptions to every rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name="Real_Estate"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Estate Exception&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7011/503/1600/Professional-Web-Services-2005.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7011/503/320/Professional-Web-Services-2005.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One exception would be the real estate market place. More than 70% of &lt;a href="http://calhomenet.com"&gt;Home Buyers&lt;/a&gt; are starting their home buying searches online. The consumer process of buying a home can extend out over many months and can even include working with a number of Realtors before ever committing to one specific Realtor. Home Sellers on the other hand, may interview numerous Realtors before settling with one they can trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There certainly are other differences to consider, and it is always a good idea to understand who your target audience is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Professional Web Services&lt;/a&gt; helping &lt;a title="Creative Online Advertising To Get Your B2B, B2C, Or C2C Business Found On The Internet" href="http://advertising.pwebs.net/creative-advertising-copywriting.html"&gt;B2B, B2C, Or C2C&lt;/a&gt; businesses market and advertise to consumers &amp; other businesses online with creative Internet marketing strategies, Online advertising campaign management, and creative Web branding solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://sanramon.pwebs.net/Strategic-Marketing/strategic-internet-marketing.pps"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://pwebs.net/images/Online_Advertising_Presentation.gif" alt="STRATEGIC INTERNET MARKETING" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc., provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services&lt;/a&gt; ethical search engine optimization, online advertising strategies, and Web branding solutions for B2B and B2C companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/feeds/113003842987223774/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8533321&amp;postID=113003842987223774' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/113003842987223774'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/113003842987223774'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2005/10/internet-made-b2b-b2c-and-c2c.html' title='Internet Made B2B, B2C, and C2C'/><author><name>James A.

Instead of imitating others and in essence spitting out the same old content, it would be much better for Yahoo and MSN to think "Inside the Box" instead of "Outside the Box"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How could this benefit the Yahoo! Search or MSN Search brand?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, if I am a faithful user of any particular search engine and am doing online research why would I want to go to another site to see the same results? Now, on the other hand if there were completely new sets of different SERPs then that would give me a whole new World Wide Web that I might not be familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another idea that might sound outlandish at first would be for a search company to have two different and unique feeds at the very same time. Each could be built with a unique algorithm and allow a button for search one or search two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If an advertising campaign was done in such a way to say: "Looking for New Results? Find it at MSN Search on the Inside of our Boxes", imagine the possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefiting the Consumer User&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Competition is what drives the market place. Not everyone likes the taste of the same Colas. Having more choices is certainly good for the consumer. It would have the added benefit of making it much more difficult for the spammers if they had to divide their attention to more than one search enterprise company. This would certainly improve the results for consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;B2B, B2C, and C2C Boxes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we have been talking about search boxes, how about Business-to-business, Business-to-consumer, and Consumer-to-consumer Business Category selection boxes all from the same Search Engine. Certainly the more advanced users do use the advanced search features, specifying or excluding certain keywords, but by having pre-assigned buttons it would make it very easy for users. Most websites fall into one, two, or all three of the B2B, B2C, and C2C categories. By establishing some sort of basis for all websites, could potentially divide and categorize most sites into these three groupings. This could be very beneficial for commerce, sales, and Consumers of all three business types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting Your B2B, B2C, &amp;amp; C2C Business Apart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free LESSON for ALL to remember ...

In fact most of the sites in the search results for B2B or even B2C for that matter were nothing but a bunch of directories involved in trickery with very little content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; width: 120px; padding: 5px 10px 0 0;"&gt;&lt;object width="120" height="600"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://pwebs.net/flash-marketing.swf"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://pwebs.net/flash-marketing.swf" width="120" height="600"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Today those results have changed significantly through hard work by individuals, improvements in search engine algorithms, and time. Still there is more to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some excellent websites that have good information for marketing and advertising to businesses or consumers. Even government .gov and educational .edu websites have detailed information related to Consumer-to-consumer, Business-to-consume, or Business-to-business  &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Internet%20marketing%20site%3A.gov"&gt;Internet marketing&lt;/a&gt; and advertising nationally or internationally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world on the Internet things change quickly. A business must learn to adapt to these changes in the market place. For example: Email marketing and newsletter publishing was a big source for lead generation in the early 2000s but that is somewhat diminished today as most companies and individual consumer Email boxes are polluted by Spam attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New technology is continually making strides into the world of B2B and B2C marketing. For example: As more people become adapt at using RSS &lt;a href="http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/atom.xml"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; feeds for information gathering or news updates this will become a prime source for marketing and advertising, and direct selling through site feeds. This technology will become more accepted by consumers as they can receive information and read it whenever they want without the threat of having their privacy violated by companies sharing email addresses or personal information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertising certainly has changed the way B2B and B2C can operate today. With search engines providing the means to target customers through targeted keyword advertising, this has changed the landscape of how businesses need to operate online. Companies are beginning to budget for this type of online promotion since studies are showing more individuals are spending time on the Web. Individuals that have been on the Web for longer periods are spending considerably more time Online and less time watching Television or reading Newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search engines have recognized this advertising trend for a long time and are continually improving their products for business and consumer use. In fact at least one search engine has beta testing going on to incorporate ads into RSS XML site feeds. This is a natural union for both ads and site feeds to automatically serve targeted advertisements to readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/InternetMarketing.htm"&gt;Internet marketing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://advertising.pwebs.net/2007/12/targeted-advertising-is-key-to-success.php"&gt;online advertising&lt;/a&gt; will continue to make a difference for businesses taking advantage of the tools at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional Web Services, &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://advertising.pwebs.net"&gt;Online advertising&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/ebusiness.htm"&gt;ebusiness&lt;/a&gt; services.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc., provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services&lt;/a&gt; ethical search engine optimization, online advertising strategies, and Web branding solutions for B2B and B2C companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/feeds/111983181506696874/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8533321&amp;postID=111983181506696874' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/111983181506696874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/111983181506696874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2005/06/making-search-engine-difference.html' title='Making a Search Engine Difference'/><author><name>James A.

Warholic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;As the Internet continues to evolve so do how B2B and B2C operate with the new generation of marketing tools.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until the &amp;#34;world wide web&amp;#34; really came into existence that the terms B2B and B2C took off. B2B or &amp;#34;business to business&amp;#34; and B2C or &amp;#34;business to consumer&amp;#34; have always been around but with the advent of ebusiness or ecommerce which typically means conducting business online has created a whole new realm for selling and advertising products and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The radio and television media and to a lesser extent print media was instrumental in the driving force for advertising to consumers or other businesses in the later part of the twentieth century. In the twenty-first century we have a new global media force that is still greatly evolving from with-in and with-out. Everyday new websites come into existence from corporations displaying their company operations to individuals with something to say. People internationally are changing their habits and are spending significantly more time online doing research, staying abreast of current events, conducting business, transferring of information from point A to B, or a large segment of the new generation involved with online game play. All of these activities have reduced the amount of time people spend with the old media outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the larger B2B and B2C companies have grabbed a hold of the changes taking place and have strengthened their market presence. Other smaller firms have not taken advantage of the great equalizer that is the Internet. Many small to medium firms hire sales people and spend thousands of dollars monthly in salaries and benefits while giving very little thought to Online advertising or Internet marketing services as a means of generating quality leads and sales. Some of these actually have budgets for print marketing and advertising in magazines and newspapers but nothing set aside for online advertising or internet marketing. Their idea of a website presence is pay someone a one-time charge to put a fancy website together and nothing more is required to increase sales or improve their brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking advantage of the Internet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small business to medium size organizations certainly need to have an online website presence but with the understanding that a web site needs to have a &amp;#34;life.&amp;#34; Just like a company continues to grow and change so to must the website. This can be used as an extension of the sales and marketing arm of a company. It can also be used in conjugation with the engineering side of many B2B companies for the purpose of content management between individuals or groups, in tracking changes in P2P &amp;#34;peer to peer&amp;#34; environments, or Web Apps (Web Applications).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many in the B2C world can also take advantage of new technologies such as Web conferencing, streaming multimedia, Wireless Web Mail, Pod casting, and other Web applications such as virtual assistants to automatically answer questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Net continues to grow so to do the &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/b2b_b2c_marketing_and_advertising_resources_information.htm"&gt;sales, marketing, and advertising tools&lt;/a&gt; at the disposal of companies to improve their market position. Sure, the big companies  hire employees to manage and create content for their web sites but small firms can also have a major impact in their market segment to really stand out and be heard. There is a commitment of time and work required to continually improve your market presence but it can be well worth it for the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in learning more about the Internet marketing services that Professional Web Services, Inc. can bring to the table to promote your company online contact us today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeted Ebusiness Internet Marketing And Online Advertising&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/ebusiness.htm"&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; can turn your business into a quality lead generating and a 24x7 sales ebusiness marketing tool today.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc., provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services&lt;/a&gt; ethical search engine optimization, online advertising strategies, and Web branding solutions for B2B and B2C companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/feeds/111879265000299486/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8533321&amp;postID=111879265000299486' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/111879265000299486'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/111879265000299486'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2005/06/internet-equalizer-story.html' title='The Internet Equalizer Story'/><author><name>James A.

The 360 virtual views work out well for displaying all sides of a product. Flash animation or a video can play an important part in the explanation of a consumer product. E marketing software to businesses or consumers with providing information in a graphic way can really make the sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain BtoC types of businesses are more appropriate for adding streaming video. For example: real estate marketing can have a major impact upon a buyer of a home by providing detailed pictures, 360 virtual tours, or streaming videos of the properties. As more individuals are going online to shop for everything from cameras to cars the natural progression is toward the big ticket items such as homes. Realtors® are adding &lt;a href="http://www.calhomenet.com/mls-home-search.html"&gt;MLS&lt;/a&gt; (Multiple Listing Service) feeds to their websites. This provides a means of anyone shopping online for their next home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some BtoB businesses can also use the Wow factor. Though, many BtoB businesses are highly specialized and may have extensive nondisclosure agreements with their customers which can make it extremely difficult to display even a picture of what it is they fabricate. Sometimes, it is even impossible for a business to mention what it is they do. In addition many of the business-to-business operations are very competitive and using pictures, video, or other types of animation may reveal trade secrets to the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while both B-to-C and B-to-B can include the wow factor the use of it needs to be tempered with ethical issues and the individual business at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For help with your Internet Marketing, Online Advertising, or Business Website Issues, consult with &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/b2b_b2c_sales_marketing_advertising_professional_web_services_strategies_solutions.htm"&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px;" src="http://marketing1now.googlepages.com/Internet_Marketing_Business.gif" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc., provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services&lt;/a&gt; ethical search engine optimization, online advertising strategies, and Web branding solutions for B2B and B2C companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/feeds/111640434510738097/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8533321&amp;postID=111640434510738097' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/111640434510738097'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/111640434510738097'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2005/05/b-to-b-and-b-to-c-wow-factor.html' title='B-to-B and B-to-C WOW Factor'/><author><name>James A.

In B2B or business to business this requires a commitment of time and good customer service prior to ever making that first sale. Customer service begins with a customer's very first contact with a company. It may take place with a phone call by a sales person or an engineer searching for a product or service from a B2B company.&amp;#34; (Excerpt from: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pwebs.net/marketing/articles/marketing-b2b-b2c.htm"&gt;Internet Marketing B2B and B2C&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; width: 120px; padding: 5px 10px 0 0;"&gt;&lt;object width="120" height="600"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://pwebs.net/flash-marketing.swf"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://pwebs.net/flash-marketing.swf" width="120" height="600"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While the article provides key differences between B2B and B2C and the e-commerce impact the Internet has made for these companies I would like to cover one of the most important aspects of a company that quite often gets overlooked. The key for business is customer service. Customer service begins at the very moment a customer has contact with a business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reminded of my childhood visits to Disneyland where the smiles on the faces of the workers put a smile on my face. It was as though the workers did it because they prided themselves in providing a great experience for the customer. In fact, it did not even seem like the workers were working but were truly enjoying themselves at the park. I am sure Disneyland has an &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mouseplanet.com/kevin/st011801.htm"&gt;interview process&lt;/a&gt; that seeks out individuals that can provide this type of great customer service experience. While most businesses are not a theme park, people still have interaction with others, and the type of customer service provided is very important for the long-term health of the organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old cliché of "The Customer is Always Right" seems to have been thrown out the door for most companies today. I am not saying the customer is always right but what seems to have gone out is the attitude that business employees need to be nice to customers, regardless if the customer is right or wrong. Some organizations have forgotten what has put bread on the table. Maybe it is because as a society we tend to think that the world owes us something. This seems to be prevalent from the top people at some of the largest corporations to the workers themselves. It is as though there is so much emphasis on the short term bottom line that companies squeeze and squeeze at the expense of the customer. Maybe this occurs due to the hierarchal structure for most corporations today. Shareholder profits have pushed aside the long-term health for a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of many experiences over the years where I simply stopped going to a place of business because of poor customer service. Either the workers were not very friendly, or not informed, or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an e-commerce world the impact of good or bad customer service can be felt in quite a few ways. One of the ways customer service can be felt is the aspect of a website. There are significant differences between what a B2C website needs to provide versus what a B2B website should provide. While both need to provide information to the customer, the information for the B2B customer maybe a lot more specialized. A large segment of the B2B world is dealing with engineers that are searching for information about a product or service they need for their next stage assembly or new product. How the website displays that information can be the first contact an individual has with a company. Once contact is made with the website, it may take a few or many visits stretched out over time in order to digest the information before an email or phone call connection is placed to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the connection process, customer service is of prime importance. How well a company handles communications on an ongoing basis can make or break the sale. Because of the nature of B2B, the rewards for good customer service can earn a customer for life. Like-wise, poor service can loose a customer for life. The financial impact of just one B2B customer can be significant compared that of one B2C customer. For this reason, business-to-business needs to give the attention to customer service to be successful in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B2C also needs to establish a foundation of good customer service from which consumers first and foremost are looking at trust. The impact of a website can make or break that very first &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://professionalwebservices.blogspot.com/2004/09/trust-q.html#trust+q"&gt;bridge of trust&lt;/a&gt;. If a B2C company breaks the trust barrier then it is very difficult to earn that trust back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internet will continue to expand our horizons. Information will be at the forefront, and just like &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features/001702.html"&gt;televisions being in 98% of homes in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, the Internet will have such a huge impact on the population that we can only imagine what it will be like for our grandchildren. For any business today, not to place any thought into their web presence would be foolish indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a detailed understanding of what &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pwebs.net/"&gt;Internet marketing&lt;/a&gt; strategies are involved for an online presence to be successful visit our website at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pwebs.net/"&gt;http://www.pwebs.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pwebs.net/b2b_b2c_sales_marketing_advertising_professional_web_services_strategies_solutions.htm"&gt;E-mail&lt;/a&gt; contact information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resources&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features/001702.html"&gt;http://www.census.gov/ Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features/001702.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px;" src="http://advertising.pwebs.net/Ad/internet-search-300.gif" border="0" alt="" /&gt;Get Found Online With Professional Web Services, Internet Marketing Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Web Services, Inc., provides &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net"&gt;Internet marketing services&lt;/a&gt; ethical search engine optimization, online advertising strategies, and Web branding solutions for B2B and B2C companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/feeds/110488417060752871/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8533321&amp;postID=110488417060752871' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/110488417060752871'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8533321/posts/default/110488417060752871'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2005/01/marketing-in-twenty-first-century.html' title='Marketing in the Twenty-First Century'/><author><name>James A.

Warholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we tend to develop a technical topic, such as the definition of B2B and B2C, or comparing the B2B vs. B2C supply chains, or picking apart of how to market B2B and B2C to the world, and make it much more complicated then it really needs to be. One of those topics is the website marketing differences between B2B and B2C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off it does not take a rocket scientist to compare the basic e-business online key differences of B2B vs B2C. In fact, once the global acronyms are spelled out, the comparison is black and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Three Acronyms of B2B, B2C, and C2C Today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;B2B = Business to business = BtoB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;B2C = Business to consumer = BtoC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;C2C = Consumer to consumer = CtoC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of advertising, online marketing, and selling to another (B = business) versus (C = consumer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you really want to talk in-depth about the different international B2B vs B2C technologies and compare BtoB v BtoC commerce predictions represented for each particular market segments, or discussion what are the B2C ethical and legal regulations, or expressing the B2B vs. B2C supply chain theoretical structure online, or the legal, ethical, and regulatory differences in detail, then I have put a collection of &lt;a href="http://pwebs.net/b2b_b2c_marketing_and_advertising_resources_information.htm"&gt;trusted resources&lt;/a&gt; links from various document and domain name resources (i.e. .gov = government, .edu = education, universities, news, websites, and general search articles) together that you can dive into and read to your hearts content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to those resource links are articles on: the importance of the Internet in business, B2C marketing, internet strategy tips, practical advertising application links, hints, effective e-marketing strategies for the technical professional, ebooks advice, and news for marketing and advertising success strategies for both categories. Also included in those articles are the most important related topics of Trust, Legal and Ethical email Issues for marketing, e-business ethics values of importance, business E-mail marketing best practices, Internet marketing solutions, online advertising strategies, ethical issues, plus the importance of ethics &amp;amp; values on the Internet and regulatory issues for websites, &amp;amp; web site privacy protections and concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the following differences between B2B and B2C associations. Also note that the letter "C" has taken on different meanings in the various acronyms depending on who you talk with. I have seen the letter "C" sometimes represent the customer, but the majority of the time "C" represents the consumer, and in my estimation that makes a lot more sense logically and technically too. If you think about it logically; whether a business, is selling to another business, "B", or selling to a consumer, "C", both of which represent the third character in the acronyms of either (B or C), and both represent selling, marketing, and/or advertising to the customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, there is another related topic: C2C or Consumer to consumer sales and marketing, which has not been covered to the degree that B2B and B2C sales and marketing have been. Examples of this would be online auctions such as eBay and how those online payment systems function, or even selling on Craigslist and other local online market places are prime examples of consumer-to-consumer marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online marketing B2B and B2C really does come down to knowing your customer semantically online. Don't automatically assume that a potential customer is going to know you just because your business places a B2B or B2C website on the Internet today.
