<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.joyeur.com/images/136.png" align="left" width="289" height="230" float="left" />Tis&#8217; the season and Joyent is happy to announce the always popular and often demanded <span class="caps">TWO</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> Joyent Accelerator sale!</p>

	<p>This sale is a limited time from now through the end of December.</p>

	<p>How it works is that you get 24 months of Joyful Accelerator goodness for the price of 10 months.  If you do that the math, that&#8217;s quite a deal.  </p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s look at a 1 GiB example:</p>

	<p><strong>Regular Monthly Pricing</strong><br />
1 GiB Monthly = $125 / month or $1500 / yr</p>

	<p><strong>Regular Annual Pricing</strong><br />
1 GiB Annual = $125 / month or $1250 / yr</p>

	<p><strong>December Sale Pricing</strong><br />
1 GiB Sale = equivalent to $52.08 / GiB per Month when you pay $1250 for 24 months!</p>

	<ul>
		<li> All pricing includes <strong>10 TB</strong> of data transfer per month per customer.</li>
		<li>All Accelerator plans have a one-time setup fee equal to the regular one month charge for that size accelerator. For example, the set up fee on a 1GB accelerator is $125.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>To Order, just order from our secure order form:</strong></p>

<item><title>In the Business Cycle of Create, Improve, Destroy: What Sun Needs to Do Now</title>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t quit thinking about Sun after last Thursday&#8217;s (Oct 30, 2008) <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-10/sunflash.20081030.1.xml">news</a>. Listening to Elgar&#8217;s Ninth Enigma Variation (<a href="http://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=252486135&amp;id=252485732&amp;s=143441">Nimrod</a>) has provided me with a soundtrack for my thoughts. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.joyeur.com/2006/06/21/sunshine">written about Sun</a>, a company I deeply admire, in the past. Jason <a href="http://www.joyeur.com/2006/03/20/the-sun-doesnt-shine-on-me">wrote</a> about Sun&#8217;s ability to create amazing products, but inability to ship them. I&#8217;ve compared Sun to the god Apollo, in a <a href="http://www.joyeur.com/2006/06/21/sunshine">post</a> that some at Sun claimed I wrote after eating magic mushrooms, to beautiful Apollo up against the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx">Leviathan</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html">Juggernaut</a> as they build their gargantuan data centers down-by-the-river.</p>

	<p>Last Thursday (Oct 30, 2008) Sun announced a loss $1.7 billion, most of that in accounting write downs (for acquisitions). The good news for Sun is, just as much seems lost, the wizard of hardware has departed, the red ink is piling up, financial sector customers are sick, not to mention the economy, the entire game of &#8220;vertically integrated systems company&#8221; (&#8220;<span class="caps">VISC</span>&#8221;) is shifting radically. Yes, radically as is &#8220;radix&#8221; from the root. What an opportunity! and happy timing!</p>

	<p>It won&#8217;t be possible to acquire or open source or lead the company out of the funk unless Sun embraces its path on the axiomatic history of successful companies: it has created, it has improved, it must now destroy. Why own a database company? The database is dead. Destroy. Tape? Tape is dead. Destroy. Java? Java is dead. Destroy. Servers? Who buys servers? Dead. Destroy. The list is nearly endless for Sun since it is a collection of so many important baubles from its first incarnation as a <span class="caps">VISC</span>. &#8220;Young, you&#8217;re crazy. That&#8217;s not a rational position. We made X on Java in FY2007. We made X on Database <span class="caps">YTD</span> FY2008. We made X on Tape in Quarter over Quarter in 2007/2008. We made X on Servers, and see the business growing in 2009.&#8221; I understand all that. So, sell it. But it is dead to Sun. You can&#8217;t truly create until you have destroyed. Nimrod came down from the mountain / with a sword made of flame / He smote down all his children / and his children grew again.</p>

	<p>Now then, having destroyed, create. It will be very exciting. Psst: you&#8217;ll be a startup with billions in the bank. Sun did $124 million in software sales in its first quarter of 2009 with tremendous growth. Focus on that. Become a $500 million dollar growth business. It also mean shrinking down from 34,000 employees&#8230;by a lot. I don&#8217;t see how the market can punish Sun for taking this tack. The share price has been destroyed already. If Sun did something like this, wow! What a move! Sun can kick ass again. Sun can outwit Leviathan and Juggernaut.</p>

	<p>P.S. There&#8217;s likely no iPod business out there to save Sun. Those are lightning strikes.</p>]]>

<item><title>Joyent Accelerator 2.1.4 Release</title>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s with excitement that I announce the newest version of the Joyent Accelerator.  The Joyent Technology team deserves a round of applause for their diligent  work on this latest version of the Accelerator template.  It is a tremendous piece of technology, and I certainly tip my hat to the team and say thank you, as both a client and an employee.  To that end, I wanted to write a brief overview to explain a bit more about what an Accelerator is, what it comes with, and some of the ways Joyent customers use them.</p>

	<p><strong>What is a Joyent Accelerator?</strong></p>

	<p>Joyent Accelerators are virtual servers based on the OpenSolaris Nevada operating system, but imbued with more friendly <span class="caps">GNU</span> userland tools and the <span class="caps">PKGSRC</span> packaging system.  Joyent Accelerators are the ideal building blocks for serious work at serious scale.  You can start small and grow big on-demand.  Web 2.0 Developers, SaaS, and PaaS providers enjoy the ease of use and simplicity of the Joyent &#8216;Infrastructure as a Service&#8217; (IaaS) Cloud.  The enterprise-class technology stack that surrounds an Accelerator, which we call a Pod, is comprised of routers, firewalls, load balancer, networks, high speed internet connections, switches, remote access, and much more.   By embedding our virtual servers in this core technology stack, Accelerators enable extreme computing and scalability at the level necessary for today&#8217;s online applications.  This allows developers and service providers to focus primarily on the application, reduce total cost of ownership, and add &#8216;agile&#8217; to the words used to describe the IT arsenal your business brings to the table.</p>

	<p>Moreover, all Accelerators come with the built-in support of a tremendous pkgsrc repository of over 600 packages!  We work hard on these packages to help you keep your systems up-to-date, easy to build and deploy.  There are probably thousands of cumulative Systems Administrator hours put into this, which you get by default just for being a Joyent Accelerator customer.</p>

	<p><strong>What Frameworks or Programming Languages can I use on a Joyent Accelerator?</strong></p>

	<p>Most existing frameworks and languages run very well on Joyent Accelerators.  A Joyent Accelerator can easily run the most demanding applications written in Java, Perl, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Python, Ruby, and Erlang.  A partial list of the frameworks we have personally tested or know to work well are:</p>

	<p>Tomcat, Gigaspaces <span class="caps">XAP</span>, Axiom Stack, GlassFish, CakePHP, Symfony, Drupal, Django, Merb, Ruby on Rails, CouchDB, .NET in mono, Ejabberd, SunGridEngine, and more.  You can find how-to guides and installation information for all of these and more on our wiki at http://wiki.joyent.com.</p>

	<p><strong>What are people doing with their Accelerators?</strong></p>

	<p>Here are some recent examples of ways our clients are using Joyent Acclerators:</p>

	<p>We have what is likely one of the largest Drupal installations anywhere.  It has been tested to run at upwards of 1000 req/sec!  That&#8217;s 2.5 billion page views per month!</p>

	<p>The recent launch of Aptana Cloud powered by Joyent&#8217;s IaaS was an exciting step as well.  Aptana cloud compute nodes launch in about 45 seconds and cost as little as $0.04 per hour.</p>

	<p>Static asset clusters using BigIP and Nginx that easily serve 2000 req/sec per node and more, and can scale nearly linearly with the addition of our managed load balancing services.  These are frequently used to augment dynamic web sites.</p>

	<p>Large scale ejabberd installation that runs for Major League Baseball live chat during games.</p>

	<p>A Symfony site serving as many as 12,000 <span class="caps">SELECT</span> queries per second and huge numbers of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests for a large application that has been successfully handling the substantial bursts of activity during the recent presidential campaign debates.</p>

	<p>A distributed java application development platform with Gigaspaces <span class="caps">XAP</span> on Joyent. This makes developing and deploying distributed cloud computing applications a breeze.</p>

	<p>Sun Grid Engine working out traditional <span class="caps">HPC</span> work loads on-demand in our environment.</p>

	<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

	<p>We are excited about this new release and so are our early release clients and beta testers.  The Accelerator is a tremendously flexible IaaS offering, that has customers saying things such as:</p>

	<p>&#8220;The new template is so fully configured that pretty much everything that had been causing me issues is now just installed by default.&#8221; -Client</p>

	<p>&#8220;I really like it as it is full of the latest and greatest stuff ready to be used. Really cool!&#8221; -Client</p>

	<p>&#8220;Only thought I had for you was that it’s nice that the accelerator comes with subversion, bzr, mercurial, and git, along with enough ruby gems to choke a horse (including both merb and camping).&#8221; -Client</p>

	<p>&#8220;Congrats for the release. I&#8217;m sure your clients will love it. I do ;-)&#8221; -Beta Tester</p>

	<p><strong>Joyent Accelerator 2.1.4 (aka 2008Q2) Release Notes:</strong></p>

<item><title>Laissez les bon temps roulez. RIP is for suckers. Joyent in the NYT.</title>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>Recently, so much ink has been spilt on our VC-backed brethren racing for the cash-conserving hills. Why they weren&#8217;t shooting for revenue and profitability from day one is beyond us.</p>

	<p>Joyent believes when a company is built to be profitable from day one, market context is much less meaningful than the ability to expend effort and succeed. As companies move from CapEx to OpEx, a flight to quality in operations and product, companies such as Joyent are sure to benefit. GigaOM and the <span class="caps">NYT</span> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2008/10/31/31gigaom-glum-economy-brings-on-good-times-for-joyent-27511.html">picked up</a> today on our success in a down market. Congrats to my fellow Joyeurs!</p>]]>

<item><title>Joyent Opens Seattle Office</title>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>We recently opened a Seattle office as a move to consolidate Joyent&#8217;s distributed development efforts with something concentrated in a specific place. You can read more about it <a href="http://www.techflash.com/venture/Joyent_expands_in_Seattle_names_former_Amazon_developer_to_33651549.html">here</a>. Ben Black, recently of Microsoft, joins Joyent as VP, Research to help lead the efforts. Jason is moving up to Seattle as well.</p>

	<p>Much more could be said about our decision to consolidate development in a single place. The tax imposed by a distributed team is heavy. We aren&#8217;t moving all our developers to Seattle, but we are committing to establishing a core.</p>]]>

<item><title>Joyent Labs: Sun Grid Engine on Joyent Accelerators</title>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p><span class="caps">BYOG</span> (Build Your Own Grid)!  Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been working with a couple of different companies to install, test, and document how to install and run Sun Grid Engine using Joyent Accelerators as the basic Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) building blocks Sun Grid Engine as the Platform as a Service (PaaS) install on that infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
     The Grid Engine project is an open source community effort to facilitate the adoption of distributed computing solutions. Sponsored by Sun Microsystems and hosted by CollabNet, the Grid Engine project provides enabling distributed resource management software for wide ranging requirements from compute farms to gridcomputing. A video is available that introduces grid computing and the Grid Engine project.
</blockquote>

	<p>The great news is that it works wonderfully.  You can very easily start small with Sun Grid Engine node or two and then scale on-demand by adding more nodes or making your nodes larger depending on the resources you need.  I have to thank Bernard Li, whom also works on the very cool Ganglia project, for helping me by contributing a how to install guide which I transformed into a wiki document.  Mark Mayo, one of our resident guru&#8217;s here at Joyent said about <span class="caps">SGE</span>, &#8220;the thing I like about <span class="caps">SGE</span> is that it&#8217;s a reliable, proven batching and queueing system.  Once you set it up, it can be handy for all sorts of async processing needs not just traditional <span class="caps">HPC</span> / financial batching&#8221;</p>

	<p>Here is a basic how to document for getting things up and running.</p>

	<p><a href="http://wiki.joyent.com/all-accelerators:kb:sge">How to Install Sun Grid Engine 6.2 on Joyent Accelerators</a></p>

	<p>In the tests that were done in the labs it was Blast simulations.</p>

<blockquote>
     Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, or <span class="caps">BLAST</span>, is an algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of different proteins or the nucleotides of <span class="caps">DNA</span> sequences. A <span class="caps">BLAST</span> search enables a researcher to compare a query sequence with a library or database of sequences, and identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold.
</blockquote>

	<p>Blast is just one example of many types of tools that can be run on an <span class="caps">SGE</span> compute grid enabled by Joyent IaaS.  I won&#8217;t even pretend to be an expert in all the wide and varied uses for <span class="caps">SGE</span> but I do know a couple of people that do know and I&#8217;m excited about the very interesting ideas they have in mind.</p>

	<p>Personally, I find this an exciting use of Joyent&#8217;s unique and extremely flexible On-Demand Cloud Computing Infrastructure and the Joyent Accelerator  as a core technology enabling the rapid deployment of a Sun Grid Engine Compute Grid.</p>

<item><title>Joyent Labs:  Axiom Stack on Joyent Accelerators</title>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>Today we got the good news that Axiom, a very interesting web framework that has been testing in the Joyent Labs, has emerged!</p>

	<p><strong>What is Axiom Stack?</strong></p>

	<p>Personally, I&#8217;m just getting to know Axiom Stack.  But, I&#8217;ve very much enjoyed chatting with the team over the past few weeks.  I think of Axiom Stack as a Javascript Platform as a Service (PaaS) on top of Joyent&#8217;s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  As such, I think it could be of interest to a number of people.</p>

	<p>A Description from the Axiom Stack web site&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
Javascript is a quite powerful and expressive language that has been saddled with a history of buggy and incompatible implementations in web browsers. It has a familiar, C-like syntax while being a fully functional language. It has language level support for <span class="caps">JSON</span>, a concise and standard object notation. Regular expressions and even <span class="caps">XML</span> are native datatypes. Most programmers these days have at least a smattering of Javascript and most teams won&#8217;t need much time at all to get rolling with it.
<br />
<br />

Axiom uses Mozilla&#8217;s Rhino engine for a fast, stable scripting platform. Because it runs on the <span class="caps">JVM</span>, you&#8217;ve got easy access to any Java libraries you put on the system classpath through the scripting layer via Rhino. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Axiom Stack is a rapid development web framework that provides everything you need to build more, better web applications. Web server, security, scripting layer, database and search are all included in a single package.
</blockquote>

	<p>Here is a Screen Shot of my skeleton <span class="caps">KLTTEST</span> application from the management interface after I installed using the <a href="http://wiki.joyent.com/all-accelerators:kb:axiom">Wiki Documentation as a guide</a>.</p>

	<p><img src="http://www.joyeur.com/images/133.jpg" alt="Axiom Stack on Joyent <br />
Accelerator" width="500" height="323" /></p>

	<p><strong>Quick Axiom Facts</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>All scripting is done in server side <span class="caps">ECMA</span>script (JavaScript)</li>
		<li>Axiom Stack provides a unified object model to all content data</li>
		<li>Built-in storage behaves like a transparent, hierarchical object database</li>
		<li><span class="caps">TALE</span> templating language, a clean and concise <span class="caps">XML</span> based attribute system for building templates</li>
		<li>Javascript makes language impedance issues arising from <span class="caps">AJAX</span> disappear</li>
		<li>Axiom Stack is secure by default &#8211; no programming needed</li>
		<li>Includes everything that you need to build a web application</li>
	</ul>
