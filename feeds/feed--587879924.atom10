A bit of a place-filler, as people are asking, and still visiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-page12-2008dec12,0,6058175.story"&gt;RIP Bettie Page&lt;/a&gt;. Kinky, sexy, but somehow a symbol of more innocent times. As I was saying to &lt;a href="http://simonwebb.net/"&gt;this rather splendid chap&lt;/a&gt; at Top Of The Pops the other night, people are running afraid of the s-word nowadays, but that was a silly thing of me to say, as I watched Simon, assisted by &lt;a href="http://duncannicholls.co.uk/"&gt;Duncan Nicholls&lt;/a&gt;, photographing Girls Aloud in the green room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls Aloud have rather passed me by, and although I can see that they are perfect pop fodder, just made to be on the box or in magazines, with razor-sharp cheekbones and very, very slender bodies in skin-tight silver sequined evening gowns, but I just don't get them. What I did find amazing, and I'd forgotten what a magic thing it is as it's been ages since I was on a shoot, was the sexual chemistry that a photo team creates with subjects. You can feel the flirtation in the air, with the subject preening and being doted upon by the photographer. And then it's all over - the backdrop gets rolled up, the cameras put away, and the feelings forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if it had been like that back in the Sixties - I went to a fantastic exhibition of &lt;a href="http://www.chrisbeetles.com/gallery/exhibition_detail.php?id=1048"&gt;20th Century Photography&lt;/a&gt; at the Chris Beetles Gallery, and thought about how much more intense the experience of being a portrait photographer must have been back then -  no digital, longer set-ups, and all hanging out with each other after hours. As ever, I was drawn to Terence Stamp as photographed by Terence Donovan (on the set of Far From The Madding Crowd) and Terry O'Neill (with the incomparable Jean Shrimpton). I just think he is the greatest face ever, so much of his time, and yet so timeless. I fell in love all over again as any sane woman ought when they see him on screen, read his wonderful autobiographies or interesting only novel &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-Terence-Stamp/dp/1857990080"&gt;The Night&lt;/a&gt; - one of many books I've lent out and not had returned, how vereh rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, also on TOTP were the Pussycat Dolls - meh in more sequins - Peter Kay being relentlessly, tiresomely Peter Kay, Leona Lewis covering Snow Patrol (have we really come to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;?); Keane (yay!) and the Kaisers, giving me my now-annual opportunity to try and cop off with Ricky Wilson and failing.  Good night with good friends, though, and I look forward to my next close up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I've been listening to &lt;a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3vYXebpLI7o"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;; a reminder that you ought not to play with volatile substances unless you want it all to blow up in your face, kids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back when I feel like it, suckers.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-all-about-chemistry.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SUKK5BlDv-I/AAAAAAAABtA/mb6ZOSBaEP8/s72-c/Bettie_Page_1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-3997728396564204245</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2008 09:18:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-12-07T09:28:58.691Z</atom:updated><title>Au revoir</title><description>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/STuVDCtsxYI/AAAAAAAABs4/cZ7wBz77FB4/s1600-h/closed203b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276975267895362946" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 150px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/STuVDCtsxYI/AAAAAAAABs4/cZ7wBz77FB4/s200/closed203b.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Because I hate Christmas; have run out of things to say, need to concentrate energies elsewhere, and am feeling rather lost.

Cheery, he generally ain't, but his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_8_%28album%29"&gt;Figure 8&lt;/a&gt; album is a wonderful bit of power pop with a dark, sad heart, and an armful of songs about loneliness and isolation that if you get, you get very deeply. Gosh, that sounds a bit Emo, doesn't it? But if you are feeling a bit Emo, as I have been this week, it's great. Here's Smith singing Happiness, which, er, isn't, really.

'I'm from (insert name of large school in Camden here), and I'm looking for sponsors for...'. 'Sorry, I don't sponsor people I don't know,' I interjected, as the wee scamp disappeared into the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minutes down the road, on the Parkway, I spotted same kid, with another little mate and a bigger lad who looked a bit like the singer from Black Kids, accosting a woman with the same request, and asking for 'the money now, please'. I think the silly woman gave it to him, as well. Then in the pub, one of the boys popped up asking for 'sponsorship'. 'And you want the money now, do you?' said a burly chap. 'I don't think so - do you think I was born yesterday?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I rang Insert Name Of Large School In Camden this morning, and was put through to the school's policeman. Policeman! &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Policeman!! &lt;/span&gt;I told him of the scam/fraud/begging the pupils were trying to pull, and he told me that the school wasn't running any sponsorship activities at the moment, and the kids probably weren't from  his school due to the colours of their uniforms; they were probably from the Insert Name Of Boys' School In Camden instead, and he would inform &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; school policeman and head teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell. Handcart. Oh well, at least they said 'please', and were quite polite as they tried to extort cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Am currently watching &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00fvgj5/Charlie_Brookers_Screenwipe_Series_4_Episode_3/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the iPlayer - essential viewing for all would-be scriptwriters.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/little-bleeders.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>12</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-4004791868742651491</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2008 11:05:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-12-05T11:26:48.571Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Sagrada Familia</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Barcelona</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Gaudi</category><title>Architecture and Morality</title><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/STkPLvJ1RlI/AAAAAAAABsw/Do4uQxD7usk/s1600-h/sagrada_familia_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 160px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/STkPLvJ1RlI/AAAAAAAABsw/Do4uQxD7usk/s200/sagrada_familia_6.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276265132751930962" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The church of the &lt;a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/sf-eng/index.php"&gt;Sagrada Familia&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona is, I think, my favourite building. I've been fascinated by it since I read about it in the Guinness Book of Records many years ago, amazed that such a structure could still be being built, and still take another 20 years to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was interested to read that Gaudi purists want &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/architecture_and_design/article5289525.ece"&gt;building work to finish now&lt;/a&gt;, as they feel his intentions aren't being followed. I'm a bit torn; architecture has to develop, and aren't all cathedrals and massive structures like this a mish-mash of styles anyway? But I am a bit of a purist, and a big part of me longs to see the building completed with exactly what Gaudi wanted - completely mad, colourful 'speech bubbles' over the entrance, and a bloody big crystal on the roof. How camp is that? The whole church is completely insane, of course, but so massively impressive, even to an old heathen like me, and who couldn't be failed to be moved by Gaudi's vision and passion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as nobody wants to turn it into a giant shopping complex, I suppose...&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/architecture-and-morality.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/STkPLvJ1RlI/AAAAAAAABsw/Do4uQxD7usk/s72-c/sagrada_familia_6.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-3292480997217811925</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 14:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-12-04T14:53:08.560Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>kindly fellow bloggers</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>manners</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Magazines</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>weight</category><title>Your attention please</title><description>Great post today from Andrew Collins on the &lt;a href="http://www.wherediditallgoright.com/BLOG/2008/12/shelfish-bastards.html"&gt;lack of manners in society&lt;/a&gt; - yes, again, but I adore his comment about 'passive-aggressive philanthropists'. I really like people who kick against society, but about things that matter, like inequality or unfairness - not feeling it's outmoded to say 'please' or 'thank-you', or who feel that following rules that actually make life easier for all of us is just &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ridiculous&lt;/span&gt;.

I bloody hate focus groups, and too much publishing is built on them these days. They mean that you can blame 14 leggings-clad women in Bolton for the failure of your new launch, instead of a bad idea. And because of this, so few people are prepared to run with a 'Hey, wouldn't it be great if...?' magazines outside of niche publishing, because those women would just make cats'-bum mouths and shake their heads. Ah well, as The Stranglers didn't say, It's Nice In Niche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* PS Spotted an acquaintance in the street at lunchtime who told me I looked 'too thin'.

It was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Night_Music"&gt;A Little Night Music&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.menierchocolatefactory.com/a_little_night_music"&gt;Menier Chocolate Factory&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/a-little-night-music-menier-chocolate-factory-1050860.html"&gt;simply magnificent&lt;/a&gt;. Being a bit thick, I've always thought Sondheim was difficult and not for me, but last year I felt the same way about Pinter, but two great productions changed my mind, and now I feel the same way about Sondheim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed everything about A Little Night Music (apart from the terribly uncomfortable seats, yikes!); the look, the music, the performances - but the lyrics are completely and utterly wonderful and all that I could want. &lt;a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/alittlenightmusic/youmustmeetmywife.htm"&gt;Witty&lt;/a&gt;, charming, and best of all, true. And adult. It suited my slightly melancholy mood rather well, and lifted it, too. You know how much I loved Hairspray, but that's a big-hearted, good-time show; I don't think there'll ever be a Stephen Sondheim adaptation of Jordan:My Story, as he is largely interested in the complex lives and histories of people who'v lived a little bit. The romance between slightly past-it actress Desiree Armfeld and lawyer Fredrik Egerman, married to a pretty, dull, frigid 18-year-old is deeply touching, especially to those of us of&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; a certain age&lt;/span&gt;, hem hem - nice to see that not just 21-year olds can look sexy and have the hots for each other.

I was a massive fan of it in the early days, but haven't bought it regularly for a decade or so.  Worryingly, it hadn't seemed to move on - ten years later I ought not to be able to recognise so many feature franchises, like Cash For Questions, or Who The Hell Does X Think They Are?, especially when the latter has none of the wit and observation of the writer who initiated it, Tom Hibbert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems so tame - Kings of Leon, Snot Patrol (I meant to write Snow, but it seemed apt to leave it), Mick Hucknall, Guns N Roses, Stephen Merchant. Yawn. And the top 50 albums of the year, which, as ever, I own about three of them; again, no change there. I liked their feature on High School Musical and Camp Rock, explained for those who probably don't have any kids, I liked it a lot. The reviews section is as good as ever it was, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Q all seemed so...dull. And bearing in mind it's probably written by people fifteen years younger than the bods behind &lt;a href="http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/"&gt;The Word&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn't have half the fun or the attitude. Yes, yes, different demographics - and The Word has a rather higher cover price, and isn't as mass-market. But Word makes you smile and think; Q just makes you go 'Where did that last decade go? Was I asleep?'&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/q-for-quite-boring.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/STQcANUV4nI/AAAAAAAABsY/k4w6VCpPwGo/s72-c/header-mag.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>23</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-2120322554040962332</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2008 09:12:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-12-01T09:19:58.715Z</atom:updated><title>Onwards/Upwards</title><description>Bloody hell, I am hurting this morning.

And &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWyKlXpstzo"&gt;I Need You&lt;/a&gt; is fab, too, with the ridiculous outdoor recording studio set-up. And wasn't &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSIjlUMV6Is"&gt;George Harrison &lt;/a&gt;utterly cute?(Just noticed today is the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1492446.stm"&gt;seventh anniversary of his death&lt;/a&gt;; is it really that long?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop movie was always a ridiculous construct, but Hard Day's Night and Help!, &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt; as they were, still stand up, I think because The Beatles were the most self-confident band, comfortable with their own identities, intelligent, and happy to work with other talents to produce something very much of its time, yet which stands up pretty well, unlike, say, Macca's Give My Regards To Broad Street, which is rubbish, but at least contains what I think is his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah2ywKPfnTc"&gt;last truly great song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, as it's the anniversary of George's death, here's Photograph, a song he and Ringo wrote, and which Mr Starr performed at George's memorial concert.

As if things weren't bad enough, I went to Woolworths at lunchtime, and now I feel super fed-up.  Graeme persuaded me to go, as yesterday, he came back with a rather nice selection of three-for-two Crimbo offers with amazing reductions, clearly designed to drag customers in due to their current financial problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All they seem to have on offer now is abject misery and doom. Going into the store, with it's ludicrously-reduced offers that seem far too good to be true, on a truly depressing selection of festive gifts (14 million piece drill bit set, mug-painting set that kids can't actually drink from, miserable wine accessories or feeble cocktail-making outfit, anyone?). There are a lot of gaps on the shelves, presumably as nobody wants to trade with a company in &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7751714.stm"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt;. The non-gifty products are so depressing, too, so wandering around the Camden emporium was the retail equivalent of having a bucket of cold water thrown over you and being told you're ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the people in the shop. I know it's Camden, not Knightsbridge, but the totally sad air of people in Woolies  was shocking. Croydon facelifts, braids, tracksuits, grease, misery...oh, the humanity! But the person who really got to me was the nicely turned-out old lady in her fur coat. She'd come out to buy a birthday card, but it was a tragic sight. Bent over almost double, she walked slowly with a stick, and I felt a little bit sick as I saw her totter round the shop - &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I'll end up like that; old and alone. Aaaaargh&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like slashing my wrists, probably with a three-for-two kitchen knife offer. So, hands-up who wants to buy Woolies now?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/11/thats-abject-misery-of-woolworths.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SS6086DVjDI/AAAAAAAABsI/0aX3AxhYNKI/s72-c/00-161oxfordstreet.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>7</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-1193446030563493891</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2008 00:27:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-11-27T01:09:15.247Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Sebastian Horsley</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Rachel Garley</category><title>Screaming myself Horsley</title><description>So yeah, I'm back, yet again screaming from the rooftops - with only the aid of a medicinal pack of Marlboro Lights as opposed to any other drugs - that &lt;a href="http://sebastianhorsley.typepad.com/sebastian_horsley/"&gt;Sebastian Horsley&lt;/a&gt; should be available on the NHS as he is such a tonic, double gin. I've had such a shitty, shitty day, feeling unloved, forgotten and deeply unattractive, that when a Facebook message hit my inbox saying that the divine Mr H was doing a reading at &lt;a href="http://www.hardysbrasserie.com/"&gt;Hardy's in Marylebone's&lt;/a&gt; louche, Regency-style basement, I knew that an evening in fine and dandy company that reeks of sex was what would hit the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://piqued.wordpress.com/"&gt;Piqued&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://therockmother.blogspot.com/"&gt;RoMo&lt;/a&gt;, my other chums who are admirers of Mr H, were &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SS3xCKaG7mI/AAAAAAAABsA/Nud4SLQJEsc/s1600-h/rachel+and+sebastian.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5273135758176611938" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 133px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 200px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SS3xCKaG7mI/AAAAAAAABsA/Nud4SLQJEsc/s200/rachel+and+sebastian.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;unavailable to join me at such short notice, so I trotted off solo, glad I'd worn a beret, Breton-ish shirt, pencil skirt and high heels, so as not to let down Soho's Mr Sex and his fabuloso girlfriend Rachel Garley in the glamour stakes. I met some jolly nice types in the bar, which was like a NoHo version of &lt;a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-2004.php"&gt;Black's&lt;/a&gt;, but on a much tinier scale. The glamour hit when the golden couple arrived; Sebastian in a red sequinned suit and white overcoat ('I look like a pint of milk'), Rachel in a short fur jacket and gorgeous black-and-white Betsey Johnson dress ('My favourite designer - sexy, Forties styles').&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am happy to go on the record and say I am in love with both of them. Rachel, so beautiful and glamorous, and Sebastian, so...Sebastian. He read a wee bit from his &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dandy-Underworld-Unauthorised-Autobiography-P-S/dp/0061461253/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1227746693&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;terrific book&lt;/a&gt;, but just freestyled on a few topics in a way most professional stand-ups would envy. Clearly, Mr H gets nervous, but he is so utterly charming and achingly likeable that he can get past all that. He's just an enchanting personality, confident yet vulnerable (with such a lovely face) which I find most appealing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And what's gorgeous about he and Rachel is that they are so in love. Forget their exotic, extreme and sexual backgrounds, this is the Real Thing. I noticed how Rachel looks at Sebastian; it's truly the stuff of romantic novels. She told me she never tires of looking at him, even after eight years together. And in his performance, when Sebastian talked about Rachel, calling her 'My muse, my girl', I was really rather moved, and envious that I don't have anyone who feels that way about me. It touched a nerve, I can tell you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was just the night I needed; style, wit, and romance advice from Mr H included. And he oughtta know. What more could you ask for? Do go and see him perform if you can. It's a tonic, even for a jaded old bird like me. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/11/screaming-myself-horsley.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SS3xCKaG7mI/AAAAAAAABsA/Nud4SLQJEsc/s72-c/rachel+and+sebastian.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-5620399110557046547</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2008 14:46:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-11-26T14:51:47.969Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Sebastian Horsley</category><title>Feeling lower than a snake's belly today</title><description>...so a chance to go and see Sebastian Horsley do a reading tonight has cheered me ineffably.

I am currently reading Stella Magazine's feature on a private member's club for children in London. (No interweb link, sadly). Rich mummy Sharai Meyers has set up the &lt;a href="http://www.purpledragonplay.com/"&gt;Purple Dragon&lt;/a&gt; so privileged kiddies can play with each other in rather snazzy surroundings, starting at just £2,500 a year. 'It's only when you have your first little one that you realise how difficult London is with children,' says yummy mummy Shari. ,'There was nowhere for kids to play in a luxury kind of way.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she set up the Purple Dragon, where little Miles' and Jocastas can record their own CD's, learn toddler yoga, play mini-golf or learn French, whilst mummy and daddy - or most likely, nanny - can eat gastrofood whilst sat on an Arne Jacobsen chair and under a Marcel Wanders lampshade (no, me neither, but I bet you can't get him in Asda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don't have kids, and would appreciate input from those of you who do, but is 'luxury play' important? Most kids I know are quite happy to play anywhere as long as they're having fun, and are with people who are  fun, too - and of course, there's the old cliche of 'give a kid an expensive toy in a big box, and they'll have more fun playing with the box'.  What I find really scary is the idea of these privileged kids growing up in a world where everything is luxurious and lovely - Just Like Mummy's! -  not a Lego brick out of place. Child development expert Carl Honore says in the Stella feature, '...if you send your child to somewhere like the Purple Dragon, they are sealed off in a bubble where everything is immaculate. But if your children only know high-end perfection, you end up denying them the most important lesson - which is learning how to make the best of what you have got...children need tot learn how to engage in rough and tumble rather than being segregated from it.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's that segregation of kids from different classes that worries me. OK, as a kid, I never mingled much with kids from Roedean or Eton, but in London, when you don't even get kids playing in the park who come from different social classes, it's a real indication of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/oct/20/britishidentity.socialexclusion"&gt;lack of social mobility&lt;/a&gt; in Britain today. It's laudable that the Purple Dragon runs &lt;a href="http://www.purpledragonplay.com/charity.htm"&gt;a charity for underprivileged kids&lt;/a&gt;, but isn't a simpler way to persuade the middle classes to care a bit more for those with fewer advantages, and help out and mix, rather than shove little Hector into a Richard Rogers nursery where every day is sunny and nobody's mum and dad are drug addicts?

Got the bus from Archway to Notting Hill Gate today, and the usual two teenage lummoxes got on and sat at the back upstairs, all acne, too much Lynx and, as ever, one of them with a fake diamond earring as big as the Ritz, dragging his earlobe down to knee-level. Of course they were playing some tinny ho-rap through their phones (I noticed they had two &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt;), but what made them remarkable was their language. I am, of course, no prude, and know I ought to swear a bit less, but at least I know not to do it when there are small children about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a little boy of about five on the back seat of the bus with his dad, and despite the chorus of effs, and more c**ts than I've probably heard in the last six months. I gritted my teeth (well, it was cold) and stuck my head into the smug liberals' newspaper of choice, but when some little girls got on with their mums at Euston, I felt compelled to go and ask the boys if they wouldn't mind toning their language down as there were small children about. They were quite alright about it, very nice in fact, but is it wrong for me to go all &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; about so much unsuitable language in a public place? I just don't like hearing five year olds say 'c**t' after copying their elders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SShpHMkEgzI/AAAAAAAABrw/k-PvsL5DXTM/s1600-h/portobello.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271578936189682482" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 160px" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SShpHMkEgzI/AAAAAAAABrw/k-PvsL5DXTM/s200/portobello.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anyhoo, a successful shopping trip. I bought a few things for Christmas (some of which I am especially smug about, oh yes), and may have accidentally also bought myself a &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-stores.com/fcp/product////4470041300"&gt;dress&lt;/a&gt; and a very little something from &lt;a href="http://www.whatkatiedid.com/src/shop.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, too. Portobello is lovely if you're in a good mood; horrible if you're not, as the crush of people on a Saturday can be just too much if you're feeling a bit on edge. Luckily, I was sporting a winter hat and a sunny disposition and had a very nice time, and was rather irritatingly cheerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had an unexpected meeting with a chum of the EC's at &lt;a href="http://www.intoxica.co.uk/index.html"&gt;Intoxica,&lt;/a&gt; a fine vinyl specialist which I suggest you visit post-haste; met some charming stallholders under the Westway, where the stalls seemed a lot better than I remembered from my last visit, and the prices more reasonable than before, went to &lt;a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1158/21820.php"&gt;Garcia's&lt;/a&gt;, the lovely Spanish grocers and brought some top food (and some very &lt;em&gt;visceral&lt;/em&gt; stuff, too...), and was whirled around the market by some cheery chaps on a record stall who noticed my enthusiastic appreciation of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhqZamMdlbI"&gt;Al Green's L.O.V.E&lt;/a&gt;. as I grooved on by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, of course, I'm shopped out and exhausted, with no food in the house. Looks like early supper will be &lt;a href="http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=es&amp;amp;u=http://servicios.laverdad.es/gastronomia/capri110602.html&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=translate&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dlitoral%2Balubias%2Bal%2Bla%2Bvasca%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4DKUK_en-GBGB267GB267"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, then.

Clearly, this is why he feels women ought to be either Madonnas or whores, but he's having a lot of fun judging which ones they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Mr Dacre is such a big fan of the Fifties, I'd suggest he visits &lt;a href="http://www.btinternet.com/%7Ebrmerc/Pinup1.html"&gt;this lovely site&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that, surprisingly, women were sexy before the Summer Of Love, and instead of judging them, even men's mags of the time celebrated pretty girls with a touch of sauce and slap 'n' tickle, a return to which I would be more than happy to see, as opposed to the Mail's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;look at these filthy whores of Babylon!

It's an ex-Christian Science church, and acoustically, I think the best sound I've ever heard at a gig, really crisp and perfect, and just the job for Mr F's acoustic solo show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He really is the most accomplished man; a nonpareil guitarist - it really is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;thrilling&lt;/span&gt; to hear him - and songwriter, and a romantic who isn't at all wet, and has a nice line of patter with the audience. He played lots of songs I hadn't seen him do live before, including several from the rather wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/North-Star-Roddy-Frame/dp/B00000GAK6"&gt;North Star&lt;/a&gt; album, including the lovely &lt;a href="http://www.actionext.com/names_a/aztec_camera_lyrics/the_north_star.html"&gt;title track&lt;/a&gt; which has been on my mind a lot lately. A great night, made nicer by meeting Ms C, who I hadn't seen for ages, and who took the great picture here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss B and I went home, opened a bottle, and stayed up FAR TOO LATE playing with the &lt;a href="http://home.luckyvoice.co.uk/"&gt;Lucky Voice home karaoke&lt;/a&gt; website. It is fantastic, but apologies to anyone in the N8 area who was kept awake into the early hours by two birds singing mid-tempo ballads from the Seventies and Eighties.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Copyright Clair Woodward 2006 - 2008&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theurbanwoo.blogspot.com/2008/11/youve-been-framed.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Clair)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0XBRB1F5ZuY/SSVslAHEDfI/AAAAAAAABrY/lyPhJsX-Twg/s72-c/rframe2.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>7</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-32853398.post-8354990958741609743</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2008 05:19:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-11-20T05:24:11.856Z</atom:updated><title>Normal service</title><description>I've woken up at 4.43am.
