<h3>Designers&nbsp;Quotes</h3>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/klytemestra/92974155/"><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/designquotes.jpg" alt="Design Quotes" /></a></p>
<h4>Architecture design&nbsp;quotes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Organic architecture seeks superior sense of use and a finer sense of comfort, expressed in organic simplicity. <small>Frank Lloyd&nbsp;Wright</small></li>
<li>I&#8217;ve always believed that architecture is more important than decoration. Scale and proportion give everlasting satisfaction that cannot be achieved by only icing the cake. <small>Billy&nbsp;Baldwin</small></li>
</ul>
<h4>Design&nbsp;Philosophy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Design is in everything we make, but it’s also between those things. It&#8217;s a mix of craft, science, storytelling, propaganda, and philosophy. <small>Erik&nbsp;Adigard</small></li>
<li>Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose. <small>Charles&nbsp;Eames</small></li>
<li>Design&#8217;s fundamental role is problem solver. <small>Fast Company,&nbsp;2005</small></li>
<li>Good design, at least part of the time, includes the criterion of being direct in relation to the problem at hand - not obscure, trendy, or stylish. A new language, visual or verbal, must be couched in a language that is already understood. <small>Ivan&nbsp;Chermayeff</small></li>
<li>Good design is the most important way to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. <small>Samsung <span class="caps">CEO</span> Yun Jong Yong,&nbsp;2004</small></li>
<li>Graphics is the visual means of resolving logical problems.&nbsp;<small>Bertin</small></li>
<li>A design isn&#8217;t finished until somebody is using it. <small>Brenda&nbsp;Laurel</small></li>
<li>Intelligent design itself does not have any content. <small>George&nbsp;Gilder</small></li>
</ul>
<h4>Branding</h4>
<ul>
<li>Brand value is very much like an onion. It has layers and a core. The core is the user who will stick with you until the very end. <small>Edwin&nbsp;Artzt</small></li>
<li>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. <small>Steve Jobs,&nbsp;2003</small></li>
<li>A logo is not a brand. <small>The&nbsp;BrandGap</small></li>
<li>You are what you are seen to be. <small>Erik&nbsp;Spiekermann</small></li>
<li>[logos are a] graphic extension of the internal realities of a company. <small>Saul&nbsp;Bass</small></li>
<li>Accessible design is good design. <small>Steve&nbsp;Ballmer</small></li>
</ul>
<h4>Business</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you think it&#8217;s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur. <small>Red&nbsp;Adair</small></li>
<li>Sometimes there is simply no need to be either clever or original. <small>Ivan&nbsp;Chermayeff</small></li>
<li>Invention is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. <small>Thomas&nbsp;Edison</small></li>
<li>I don’t design clothes, I design dreams. <small>Ralph&nbsp;Lauren</small></li>
</ul>
<h4>Typography</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joy_sale/2827037000/"><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/designquotes2.jpg" alt="Design Quotes" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Typography at its best is a visual form of language linking timelessness and time. <small>Robert&nbsp;Bringhurst</small></li>
<li>Most people think typography is about fonts. Most designers think typography is about fonts. Typography is more than that, it’s expressing language through type. Placement, composition, typechoice. <small>Mark&nbsp;Boulton</small></li>
<li>Writing is not a series of strokes, but space, divided into characteristic shapes by strokes. <small>Gerrit Noordzij,&nbsp;1931</small></li>
<li>From all these experiences the most important thing I have learned is that legibility and beauty stand close together and that type design, in its restraint, should be only felt but not perceived by the reader. <small>Adrian&nbsp;Frutiger</small></li>
<li>Faces of type are like men’s faces. They have their own expression; their complexion and peculiar twists and turns of line identify them immediately to friends, to whom each is full of identity. <small>J.L.&nbsp;Frazier</small></li>
<li>Great <a href="http://typophile.com/node/13406">typophile</a> thread with many more typographical&nbsp;quotes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Favourite designers quotes from fellow&nbsp;bloggers</h3>
<p>I have contact various authors from design blogs and asked them their favourite designers quote, this came out as a very positive and inspiring design quotes. Thank you for&nbsp;participating!</p>
<ul><strong><em>Jin Y</em></strong> from design <span class="amp">&amp;</span> inspiration <a href="http://www.8164.org">blog 8164.org</a> send in the following&nbsp;quote:</p>
<li>Form follows function-that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union. <small>Frank&nbsp;Lloyd</small></li>
<blockquote><p>Comment by Jin Y: I&#8217;ve been a long time admirer of Mr. Wright&#8217;s work. His designs are elegant, simplistic and comfortable. As a web designer, I often see the correlations between good architecture design and good web design. Both have the elements of form and function. I often hear people talk about form and function as if they were mutually exclusive, or one precedes the&nbsp;other.</p></blockquote>
<hr /><strong><em>Dmitry Fadeev</em></strong> from <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/">Usabilitypost</a> send me the following&nbsp;quotes:</p>
<li>The two most important tools an architect has are the eraser in the drawing room and the sledge hammer on the construction site.&#8221; <small>Frank Lloyd&nbsp;Wright</small></li>
<li>To design something really well you have to get it. You have to really grok what it&#8217;s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to thoroughly understand something&thinsp;&#8212;&thinsp;chew it up, not just quickly swallow it .. .. A lot of people in our industry haven&#8217;t had very diverse experiences. They don&#8217;t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions, without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one&#8217;s understanding of the human experience, the better designs we will have. <small>Steve Jobs, Wired (March,&nbsp;1996)</small></li>
<hr /><strong><em>David Airey</em></strong> from <a href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/">LogoDesignLove</a> and <a href="http://www.davidairey.com">David Airey</a> send in the following&nbsp;quote:</p>
<li>The real issue is not talent as an independent element, but talent in relationship to will, desire, and persistence. Talent without these things vanishes and even modest talent with those characteristics grows. <small>Milton&nbsp;Glaser</small></li>
<hr /><strong><em>Dan Reynolds</em></strong> from <a href="http://www.typeoff.de">TypeOff</a> send in the following&nbsp;quotes:</p>
<li><span class="dquo"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></span>Schrift ist nicht alles, denn Schrift ohne Anwendung ist wie eine Blume ohne Duft, ist wie eine ungekorkte Flasche und ein ungeküßtes Mädchen.&#8221; This could probably be translated as, &#8220;type is not everything, because type without an application is like a flower without aroma, an uncorked bottle and a girl who has never been kissed.&#8221; <small>Günter Gerhard Lange&nbsp;(1996)</small></li>
<li><span class="dquo"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></span>To be blunt, and it is good advice to serious newcomers: do not make the mistake of being afraid to be labelled ‘conventional’, ‘traditional’, or any other such dusty term.&#8221; <small>Fred Smeijers, from Type Now: A Manifesto&nbsp;(2004)</small></li>
<hr /><strong><em>LaurenMarie</em></strong> from <a href="http://www.creativecurio.com">CreativeCurio</a> send in the following&nbsp;quotes:</p>
<li>Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that&#8217;s why it is so complicated. <small>Paul&nbsp;Rand</small></li>
<li>I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it. <small>Pablo&nbsp;Picasso</small></li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you&#8217;ll have to ram them down people&#8217;s throats. <small>Howard Aiken (not a designer, but rather the main guy behind <span class="caps">IBM</span>&#8217;s Harvard Mark I computer. Still, this could apply to&nbsp;design!)</small></li>
<hr /><strong><em>Leon Paternoster</em></strong>, a teacher, designer and <a href="http://leonpaternoster.com/blog/">blogger</a> send in the following&nbsp;quotes:</p>
<li>Good design, at least part of the time, includes the criterion of being direct in relation to the problem at hand - not obscure, trendy, or stylish. A new language, visual or verbal, must be couched in a language that is already understood. <small>Ivan&nbsp;Chermayeff</small></li>
<li>Colour does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it. <small>Pierre&nbsp;Bonnard</small></li>
<li>Communicative grammar is generally defined by contrast, balance, harmony, and distribution. <small>Andy&nbsp;Rutledge</small></li>
<li>The design process is essentially a process of subtraction, organisation and emphasis. <small>Leon&nbsp;Paternoster</small></li>
<li>Simplifying design equates to reducing the choices available to the user to a few core, meaningful options. <small>Leon&nbsp;Paternoster</small></li>
<hr /><strong><em>Adelle Charles</em></strong> from <a href="http://www.fuelyourcreativity.com">Fuel Your Creativity</a> send in the following&nbsp;quote:</p>
<li>“Good designers can create normalcy out of chaos; they can clearly communicate ideas through the organizing and manipulating of words and pictures.” <small>Jeffery&nbsp;Veen</small></li>
<hr/><strong><em>Erik Brandt</em></strong> designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> teacher at Minneapolis College of Art and Design and <a href="http://geotypografika.com">blogger</a> send in the following&nbsp;quote:</p>
<li>For after all, a poster does more than simply supply information on the goods it advertises; it also reveals a society’s state of mind.” No posters, no culture? <small>Armin&nbsp;Hoffman</small></li>
<li><span class="dquo"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></span>Among the few I have indicated, is there no dynamic man of action, the rebel who will help determine the aspect of the collective expression of tomorrow? Ponder this question and know that to make beautiful creations for the sake of their aesthetic value will have no social significance tomorrow, will be non-sensical self-gratification. Every era contains the conditions for providing a rebel.&#8221; <small>Piet&nbsp;Zwart</small></li>
<hr/>

<h3>The (mostly) true story of Helvetica and <span class="caps">NYC</span>&nbsp;Subway</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-001.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
A fabulous article by Paul Shaw for the New York subway graphic system. In a dept review of the sign system, choose of typeface and creation of design manual this nine pages essay describes everything. I have enjoyed reading this article but was looking for some examples of the sign manual, searched Google and found some images of the sign design manual at&nbsp;Flickr.</p>
<h4><span class="caps">NYC</span> Transit Authority graphics&nbsp;system</h4>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-002.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-mostly-true-story-of-helvetica-and-the-new-york-city-subway">article by Paul Shaw at Aiga</a> and take a look at this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/triborough/sets/72157594441672864/detail/">Flickr set</a> of the original <span class="caps">NYC</span> Transit Authority graphics system—designed by Massimo Vignelli and Vignelli Associates in&nbsp;1970.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minisite <span class="caps">FF</span>&nbsp;Trixie</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-008.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
Dutch type teacher and designer Erik van Blokland released with FontShop the minisite about his typeface <span class="caps">FF</span> Trixie, since its release in 1991 Trixie was one of the few good workable typewriter typefaces&nbsp;available. </p>
<p>Erik van Blokland finalized the typeface Trixie with two new variants: <span class="caps">FF</span> Trixie Rough, and <span class="caps">FF</span> Trixie <span class="caps">HD</span>, available each with Light and Heavy weights. At the minisite you are able to see the typeface fontfonts and the new typefaces have much more detail than the original. In the images you can see the effects of the analog look and feel of Trixie, Erik was kind enough to send me the masthead (at the top of the page), text designworkplan, thank you very much for sending it to&nbsp;me. </p>
<h4>Example of usage <span class="caps">FF</span>&nbsp;Trixie</h4>

<h3>Vancouver 2010&nbsp;Pictograms</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-003.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
Via Iconglobe I spotted the newly designed pictograms for the Vancouver Olympic Wintergames in 2010, as part of a complete brand&nbsp;identity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Olympic and Paralympic Games designs have a long tradition of creativity and&nbsp;excellence</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h3>The designers review of&nbsp;Books</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-004.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
A new website about books for the creative minds, written by designers. With <em>designers reviews books</em> the authors review (expensive) design books and allows you to buy or find related information about the books&nbsp;online.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although there are several good design websites that occasionally have book reviews, there didn’t seem to be a single place online where you could get constant updates and reviews of new (and sometimes old) design&nbsp;books.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.designersreviewofbooks.com/">The Designers review of Books</a>&nbsp;website</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thoughtpile</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-005.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
Thoughtpile a website where visitors are allowed to share thoughts about specific (green) topics, users can submit ideas and the most discussed idea will be featured in the Thoughtpile. Crowd thinking and creating ideas and solutions is becoming more and more&nbsp;popular.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.thoughtpile.org/">Thoughtpile</a> and share your thoughts and&nbsp;ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="caps">PANTONE</span>&nbsp;Sneakers</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-006.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
Today is the last day that you can pre-order special <span class="caps">PANTONE</span> SeaVees Sneakers, use the code on the website in the onlinestore to get yours! The collection will be in stores Spring&nbsp;2009.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.pantone.com/Resources/MonthlyIssues/20081118/en-na/pantone081118.htm">this website</a> to find the information about <span class="caps">PANTONE</span>&nbsp;Sneakers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>iPhone App: Font&nbsp;Viewer</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-007.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
OSXWerk released one of the first iPhone apps for font lovers, this free app allows you to select <span class="caps">MACOSX</span> fonts and enlarge the typeface. You have the ability of type text and display it in the selected&nbsp;typeface. </p>
<p>It would be very interested to see more type related iPhone apps coming. For instance what I would think will work great is a iPhone version of <em>WhatTheFont</em>. You make a photo of a typeface you are interested in, the iWhatTheFont will recognize the typeface and can view it online or buy the specific&nbsp;typeface. </p>
<p>Please share your ideas or suggestions of type-related iPhone&nbsp;Apps?</p>

<h3>Is Graphic Design&nbsp;Art?</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-nov-011.jpg" alt="SignSphere"/><br />
There has been much talk about this website, Is Graphic Design Art?. When I first encountered this question I was intrigued by the fact people think about graphic design as art. In fact most people think graphic design is art. Lets take a look at the&nbsp;definitions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Graphic Design</strong></em>: The term graphic design can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.<br />
<em><strong>Art</strong></em>: Art is the process or product of deliberately and creatively arranging elements in a way that appeals to the senses or&nbsp;emotions. </p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>So tell me is <a href="http://isgraphicdesignart.com/">Graphic Design</a>&nbsp;Art?</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="dropcap-first"><span class="capitals">As part of the new brand identity</span> of the Dutch government Peter Verheul designed a custom typeface for all forms of visual communications. This is the result of a new way the Dutch government wants to position themselves into society. Currently there are over 200 departments and ministries which all have different logos and uses different typefaces as their brand identity. In a pitch held by the Dutch government studio Dumbar won this competition and introduced a new logo and 1 brand identity: <strong>1&nbsp;Logo</strong>.</p>
<h3>Typeface: Rijksoverheid Serif /&nbsp;Sans</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-009.jpg" alt="Dutch government typeface Rijksoverheid Sans Serif" /><br />
From the beginning of 2008 Peter Verheul was asked by studio Dumbar to take his typeface Versa and transform the typeface usable for a larger audience. He changed the look and feel of the Serif version of Versa Serif and created a complete new set of letters for the Sans version. The fonts are named Rijksoverheid Sans and Rijksoverheid Serif. The name of the typeface is recognizable as &#8220;government&#8221; and will be used in every way of visual communication. The Rijksoverheid Sans will be used mainly for headings of text and in signage or wayfinding systems. The Rijksoverheid Serif is used as bread letter for reading text. In just under nine months Peter Verheul managed to finalize the fonts and released them in four different variations, from Regular, <em>Italic</em> to&nbsp;<strong>Bold</strong>.</p>
<h3>Designing the Rijksoverheid&nbsp;typeface</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-002.jpg" alt="Design of typeface Rijksoverheid Sans Serif" /><br />
<img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-004.jpg" alt="Print samples of Rijksoverheid Sans Serif" /><br />
During the time of creation Peter Verheul did not have much time to take pictures (as said in his introduction speech) but he kept a note book full of drawings and notes of creating and designing the typefaces. After finishing the typefaces he donated them to <em>Bijzondere Collecties</em>, a Dutch important collection of valuable work from Dutch graphical, typographical- artists. The Bijzondere Collections hosts the booklet, first printouts and everything that is related in creating the typeface&nbsp;Rijksoverheid.</p>
<h3>Letterijk&nbsp;book</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-005.jpg" alt="Letterijk the creation of Rijksoverheid Sans Serif" /><br />
Letterrijk Book is a story about the birth and why of creation the typeface Rijksoverheid written by Mathieu Lommen, published by De Buitenkant Publishers. The booklet covers everything from the start of the project and the combination with project 1 Logo, a story about how the typography started working together, with many drawn examples of early stages of letter design. It also covers the complete glyphs of the typeface variations, with over 700 glyphs each this typeface is multi-language proof. With the design of the typeface several key factors of demands where given to Peter Verheul and Studio Dumbar. The typeface should be easy to read, should not be too wide in order to reduce printing costs, it could be used for all forms of visual communication of the Dutch Government and every department will use it therefore it will reduce the costs of different typeface licenses. The typeface will function as a bridge between society and government, a typeface that everybody will feel comfortable&nbsp;with.</p>
<h4>RijksoverheidSans</h4>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-008.jpg" alt="Rijksoverheid Sans" /><br />
In this example above you can cleary see the use of Rijksoverheid Sans, an easy to read typeface with a large x-height. This allows maximum legibility for heading text, signage, wayfinding and other forms of visual identity. In the introduction speech Peter Verheul mentioned that he was impressed by the way the Sans version would be used for bread letter. He is interested to see the further development of Rijksoverheid Sans in this&nbsp;field.</p>
<h4>RijksoverheidSerif</h4>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-006.jpg" alt="Rijksoverheid Serif" /><br />
In the example above the Rijksoverheid Serif is the bread letter for reading text, I have read the booklet a couple of times and it seems to be a very legible typeface. Which will form the basis of the whole brand identity of the Dutch&nbsp;Government.</p>
<h3>Project: 1&nbsp;Logo</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-010.jpg" alt="Project Logo 1 Rijksoverheid" /><br />
The Dutch government brand identity was not concise or consistent, with over 200 departments and ministries costs were rising of each department havigd their own logo, typeface, print materials, signage and everything that involves the visual communication of that department. There was not a direct link to society and confusion about the identity the government wants to presents themselves. Project 1 Logo was born to bring back all brand identity of the Dutch government and give one signal to society about what the government stands for. In a pitch several design studios participated in order to create 1 Logo, 1 brand, 1 identity, 1 way of communicating between society and government, coming all together as 1 government. From 2009 until 2011 every department should use the new logo and typeface in all forms of visual communication, a huge operation which involves many parties. I believe there will be a brand guideline from studio Dumbar to lead everything into the correct, concise and consistent use of the brand&nbsp;identity.</p>
<h3>1 Logo&nbsp;Signage</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-011.jpg" alt="Project Logo 1 Signage" /><br />
We have been pleased to work on a mock-up signage nameplate for 1 logo project, the Rijksoverheid logo was engraved into an stainless steel&nbsp;nameplate.</p>
<h3>Availability of Rijksoverheid Sans /&nbsp;Serif</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/rijksoverheidsans-serif-typeface-007.jpg" alt="Glyphs of Rijksoverheid Serif" /><br />
At the moment only the parties involved in the brand identity process have access to Rijksoverheid typefaces, as the project 1 Logo evolves more designers will come across the typefaces and will give new direction to the look and feel of the Dutch&nbsp;Government.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="dropcap-first">T<span class="capitals">here are several books about signage systems</span> and environmental graphic design available. Andreas Uebele wrote the book <em>Signage systems <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Information graphics</em> and this is one of the best and most extensive books about signage available. I enjoyed reading and taking a detailed look at the projects spoken in this professional source book and with most of the described signage projects are a specific details by the designers. A <em>truly</em> great signage book, a total must&nbsp;have.</p>
<h3>Signage systems <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Information&nbsp;Graphics</h3>

The 336 counting pages book has a hard cover and is 28,5 x 24 cm. The pages read well and quickly you can find what you are looking for by the index. The text layout and choose of typography fits well and reads great, designed in a grid way (similar to how signage is designed). Andreas Uebele is a well known designer with the design identity agency in Germany &#8220;Büro Uebele&#8221;. They have managed to design many signage <span class="amp">&amp;</span> information graphics projects in the last years, from airports, offices, library and more.

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Production, planning and sign&nbsp;management</li>
<li>
Projects from sign designs from all over the&nbsp;world</li>

<h3>Typography <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Signage</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/bookreview-signage-uebele-002.jpg" alt="typography and signage" /><br />
A key factor in signage design <span class="amp">&amp;</span> information graphics is the choose of typography, with the choose of typeface you are able to make or break a design and its functionality. In the book is explained how to choose a typeface and what characteristics a certain typeface needs to have in order to be used in signage systems. Andreas Uebele mentions different typefaces that they used in projects and explains the differences between the mentioned typefaces. A good introduction into choosing a typeface for signage <span class="amp">&amp;</span> information graphics. Further on in the introduction the book goes deeper into designing for signage and which methods to use in order to achieve an effective signage <span class="amp">&amp;</span> wayfinding system. With various examples and drawings you quickly read how and what to&nbsp;design. </p>
<h3>Sign&nbsp;Design</h3>

<img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/bookreview-signage-uebele-008.jpg" alt="Sign Design" /><br />
The book explains how to use proper color systems and how to place them into a environment to create a good working signage system. The author explains why they have chosen the color combination, typography and size of the airport signage project described in the book. A great insight in learning more about signage design. Further on there are more projects described and explained with extensive photo material and the actual production drawings. By the drawings you can get a good view of how the signage systems are designed and&nbsp;produced. </p>
<h3>Signage projects from other&nbsp;designers</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/bookreview-signage-uebele-007.jpg" alt="Sign Design" /><br />
In the book are also described many other projects from different designers and design agencies than Buro Uebele, for instance Schiphol designed by Bureau Mijksenaar. There are various images and concept drawings aswel as the detailed information about typography, color use and more. By adding more information from other designers makes this book a must have reference guide into graphic design and signage systems.

<h3>Introducing my new corporate signage&nbsp;website</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.baumannsign.nl/"><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-october-08-013.jpg" alt="signsphere october 08 design inspiration" /></a><br />
Baumann Sign is the name of my new corporate website (at the moment Dutch only). For quite some time I haven&#8217;t had the time to implement the new corporate signage website for my company. We are a <strong>signage <span class="amp">&amp;</span> wayfinding</strong> company in Amsterdam, The&nbsp;Netherlands. </p>
<p>Designing <span class="amp">&amp;</span> producing signs for office buildings, parking facilities, public buildings, hotels and more. We are specialized in create <em>unique</em> signage systems through the use of well thought out design in combination with color, architecture and typography. Our main goal is to create signs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> wayfinding systems that work in the environment and lead visitors in the right direction. As a wayfinding product I designed a sign system called <a href="http://www.baumannsign.nl/interne-bewegwijzering/signswitch.htm">SignSwitch</a>, a flexible signage system with a touch of design using materials such as stainless steel in combination with colored&nbsp;acrylic. </p>
<p>Please take a look at our <a href="http://www.baumannsign.nl/bewegwijzering/projecten">signage projects </a>page to see some of the things we have done in the past. Please let me know what you think of the design of the website, your comments are highly&nbsp;appreciated.</p>

<h3>Use of DesignWorkPlan Arrows&nbsp;collection</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-october-08-001.jpg" alt="signsphere october 08 design inspiration" /><br />
Logo Designer Kathy Moore used various icons from my arrow <span class="amp">&amp;</span> icons collection as a basis for the logo design of South Logan County Rural Health Care Network. Great work! Thank you for sending your&nbsp;materials.</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason I chose the circles with the arrows is that I needed to represent the community as a whole and the healthcare community coming together.  I liked the idea of having the arrows intersect to represent that connection.  Sustainability is a major goal for our project so the circles help to express that because circles are often representative of something that goes on and on. Overall, the graphics I used from your site couldn’t have been more perfect to represent the project and the goals of it and all of the members were very happy with the final product. <small><em>Kathy&nbsp;Moore</em></small></p></blockquote>

<h3>Re-design of&nbsp;InspirationBit</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/signsphere-october-08-012.jpg" alt="signsphere october 08 design inspiration" /><br />
The long awaited re-design of InspirationBit, a faboulus website about design, inspiration, art, photography and much more, written by Vivien. The re-design is great work, I really like the way she has put up the website, the focus on the content and thoughts on navigation. At the homepage at the top you will find the three latest articles with below that the latest featured article. At the bottom of each page you will find a huge footer containing everything you want to find at InspirationBit. The website is scalable, with a wider screen the tree on the left will have a bigger impact on the design. A nice drawing and looks great aswel! The color usage is purple and green which is a colorful yet professional look. The content of InspirationBit is just superb, posts are really thought out well and giving a in-dept look on the articles topic. Take a look at InspirationBit and tell us what you&nbsp;think!</p>

<blockquote><p>Visible at a distance of 1.5 kilometers, the magnificent screen on the façade of Podium is designed by the <span class="caps">L.E.D.</span> technology.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="dropcap-first">O<span class="capitals">tl Aicher one of the leading German</span> graphic designers developed in 1988 the typeface Rotis, named after the town Olt Aicher lived in. With Rotis he tried to create to maximum legibilty face with a high x-height. Available in four font families from sans to serif, Rotis typeface can be found everywhere around you. Unfortunally Olt Aicher died in a traffic accident in 1991. Linotype currently owns the Rotis Font Family, where all of the font variantions can be&nbsp;bought.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rotis® gives an impression of both strength and generosity and all four versions can be used interchangeably with one another. Rotis® is suitable for book/text, documentation/business reports, business correspondence, magazines, newspapers, posters, advertiments, multimedia, corporate design. <small><a href="http://www.linotype.com/1827/rotis.html">from&nbsp;Linotype</a></small></p></blockquote>
<p>During my holiday in the beautiful German Steigerwald (near Nürnberg and Bamberg) I came across the Rotis Font Family quite often, this is a photo showcase collection of the Font Familiy Rotis&nbsp;Sans.</p>
<h3>A book about&nbsp;photography</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-001.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
This is where I first spotted Rotis, during a visit at the bookstore and came to the idea to putting this post together. As you can see, Rotis works well for legibility and&nbsp;design.</p>
<h3>Street&nbsp;Signs</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-002.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
We were walking down the streets where I took this photo of a small billboard, The font family Rotis has enough detail to show at large points. Good readable from a&nbsp;distance.</p>
<h3>Cafe&nbsp;Signage</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-003.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
Sitting down for a espresso where I saw this acrylic nameplate, clearly the usage of the noticable ´e´ of Rotis. A good color usage as where the brick will look dark from a distance the off-white lettering will stand&nbsp;out.</p>
<h3>1000 Jahre&nbsp;Bamberg</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-005.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
During the celebration of 1000 years of the city Bamberg various information signposts has been put up in the city (now only available in the Church), a clear usage of font&nbsp;Rotis.</p>
<h3>Museum&nbsp;Nürnberg</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-006.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
We went to various museum in Nürnberg, but this one got my attention. The openinghours and detailed information folder about the museum was all created using&nbsp;Rotis.</p>
<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-007.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
My wife wanted to go shopping, so I sat down and read some magazines. Here I spotted Rotis in a Loreal print ad, see the&nbsp;payoff.</p>
<h3>Escape route&nbsp;plan</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-008.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
When walking down a mayor cityhall I spotted this Escape signage. All type is printed using Rotis font family, easy to&nbsp;read.</p>
<h3>Bookstore</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-009.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
Going to a bookstore in Germany is a pleasure for all typophiles, you can recognize a font on almost every cover you see. I spotted the Rotis on the cover of this&nbsp;book.</p>
<h3>Door&nbsp;Signage</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-010.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
A small signage for a local company called Temme uses Rotis on their door signage, a bold versions and a regular are displayed in the&nbsp;design.</p>
<h3>Museum&nbsp;Gerolzhofen</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-011.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
When visiting the museum in the small city of Gerolzhofen you can find the openinghours plate created using the font Rotis. With so many lines and text Rotis proves a clear&nbsp;legibilty.</p>
<h3>Arte&nbsp;Caffe</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-013.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
At the tourist guide shop I found this business card all designed using the type Rotis. Unfortunally we could not find the coffe shop, but I sure liked the&nbsp;design.</p>
<h3>Kind of&nbsp;noodles</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-014.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
At the grocery we bought some kind of noodles (Spätzle), you can get this typical German kind of noodle with many dishes. At the package I spotted the Rotis, small printed but&nbsp;readable.</p>
<h3>Rotling&nbsp;Wine</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-015.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
With food you can drink wine, I bought this dry Franken white wine of 2007. The label was printed using the type Rotis. If you can find a bottle I can suggested it, tasted very&nbsp;good.</p>
<h3>Steigerwald&nbsp;walk</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-016.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
The area we stayed was Steigerwald, a great forrest area and we went for many walks there. Our guide was a map of the area, with on the frontpage a design using&nbsp;Rotis.</p>
<h3>Shoppingbag</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-017.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
At the local bakery we bought typical German bread (really dark with good taste), we carried the bread in this paperbag, printed with the details of the bakery using&nbsp;Rotis.</p>
<h3>Franken&nbsp;Brunnen</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font-series-rotis-sans-019.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans is everywhere" /><br />
Water is good for everybody and Franken Brunnen does it all the way, they use Rotis on almost every form of visual&nbsp;communication.</p>
<h3>Availability of Font Family&nbsp;Rotis</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.designworkplan.com/wp-content/font_rotis_olt_aicher.jpg" alt="Rotis Sans by Olt Aicher" /><br />
The font package is available in four type families, via&nbsp;Linotype:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.linotype.com/49227/rotisserif-family.html">Rotis® Serif Font&nbsp;Family</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linotype.com/49252/rotissansserif-family.html">Rotis® Sans Serif Font Family </a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linotype.com/49198/rotissemisans-family.html">Rotis® Semi Sans Font Family </a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linotype.com/49242/rotissemiserif-family.html">Rotis® Semi Serif Font&nbsp;Family</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I like Rotis Sans Serif Font Family (2nd on the list above) the best, it has a very distinctive look and feel with a high legibilty for usage in many fields of visual&nbsp;communication.</p>

<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s new in corporate identities, and worth attention? Who did it and why? Fact and opinion. We tell stories of worldwide strategic interest, creative excellence, and leadership intent (or the regrettable lack of it), when we can find the story and properly credit the CEOs, planners,  and&nbsp;designers</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[Take a look at a showcase of over 20 different airport signage designs, from cities all around the world. Also in this article detailed information about how to design airport signage &#038; wayfinding systems.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="dropcap-first">A<span class="capitals">irport signs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> wayfinding systems</span> are guides to show visitors the way. From finding the toilets, gates, tranfsers or even the coffee corner, signs are needed to show the way. Airport signage design is not a easy task and creating a wayfinding system in a airport which will have to guide thousands of visitors takes a in-dept case study of the visual environment, travellers stream, detailed prints of the building and much more. In this photo showcase I&#8217;ve collected images of Airport Signage from cities all over the world, using the photo website&nbsp;flickr.</p>

<h2>Airport Signage&nbsp;Design</h2>
<p>When designing signage for a Airport or a other public building you have to take a good notice of the <em>visual surroundings</em> the signage will be placed in. The backgound colors of walls and windows, the amount daylight let in the building, the lighting and more environmental elements are important when designing signage for a aiport. In a visual crowed environment it is important that signage design stands out to its background, for a maximum effect. Use a color system with not to many variations and be consistant with the color usage. Think about using illumnated signs to enhanche the readability of the signage and always use mockups of the signs to test if the signage is working in the visual&nbsp;surroundings.</p>
<h2>Color, typography design and use of&nbsp;pictograms</h2>
<p>Design <em>high contrast</em> signs to ensure good readability and legibilty of the signage. Colors that work well are a dark background with a light colored text and pictograms. For example a black background with white illuminated lettering will ensure a high contrast which has a good readability from a distance. Other commen color combinations are a yellow background with black lettering. For typography use a sans type like <span class="capitals"><span class="caps">FF</span> Info</span> by Erik Spiekermann or <span class="capitals">Frutiger</span> by Adrian Frutiger. Use a font that have a high x-height which will increase the legibility of the signs. Use only one font in all visual communication levels of the airport signage. For international airports it is vital to use symbols to indicate the facilities in and around the airport, always strengthen the symbol with written text in the native language and perforably in English language. This will ensure that most of the visitors can read the&nbsp;signs.</p>
<h2>Arrow&nbsp;design</h2>
<p>Arrows are one of the most important design features of a wayfinding system for airports, with a pointing arrow you will be able to guide visitors to their destination. Choosing a arrow within a design can make or break the design, don&#8217;t over due the arrow but gently incorporate the arrow into the sign in balance with type. Recently I&#8217;ve released a arrow collection to use in a design. <a href="http://www.designworkplan.com/signage-symbols/free-vector-arrows.htm">Download the 56 free arrows as a Illustrator vector file&nbsp;here</a>.</p>
<h2>Sign design using a&nbsp;grid</h2>
<p>Always use a grid to design Signage <span class="amp">&amp;</span> wayfinding systems in order to maintain balance and flexibility  in the design. In a future article I will go in dept by explaining how to design signage using a&nbsp;grid.</p>
