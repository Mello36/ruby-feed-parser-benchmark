<p>Why can&#8217;t I get my record released? After selling more than 4,000,000 copies of her first four studio albums (each of which soared at least Gold status) and racking up 12 Top-10 singles, that&#8217;s a question Jo Dee Messina just doesn&#8217;t know exactly how to answer. </p>
<p>Messina, a Massachusetts native who was a mainstay on country radio throughout the second half of the previous decade (and well into this one), finished her latest album, <em>Unmistakable</em>, ages ago. It&#8217;s been ready, sitting on a shelf in the Curb Records building in Nashville, unheard by her fans. Originally scheduled for early 2008 release, the album was pushed back to fall. Fall came and went. And Messina is still waiting.</p>
<p>In this exclusive and revealing interview with the genuinely cheerful, fiery redhead, Messina talks about <em>Unmistakable</em>, the reasons for its delayed release, and about finding inner balance in the midst of a sometimes frustrating career. </p>
<p><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/jo-dee-messina-01.jpg' alt='Jo Dee Messina' style="float: right; margin: 3px 0 0 10px" /><strong>JIM MALEC: What’s the status of <em>Unmistakable</em>? </strong></p>
<p><strong>JO DEE MESSINA</strong>: They kinda pushed it back again. The single comes out in March, and the album will come out, gosh, in April, May, June, July. August? September? Maybe next year. </p>
<p><strong>JM: Sometime? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MESSINA</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p><strong>JM: Where are you right now, as far as your career? I know you’ve been working hard, but we haven&#8217;t heard much from you in a while.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MESSINA</strong>: No, you haven’t. Everything’s been caught up in a lot of turmoil trying to get this record released. It’s funny, because people will say things like, “So you took some time off,” and I’m like, absolutely not! I’ve been working every single day. We’ve been touring really hard. We’ve had this record together for over a year now. I mean, it’s like, &#8220;I’m not taking any time off, what are you, crazy?&#8221;</p>

<li><em>The New Republic</em> caused a stir yesterday by announcing that <strong>Tim McGraw</strong> was <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/12/09/quick-draw-mcgraw.aspx">seriously considering a gubernatorial run</a> in the state of Tennessee for 2010, but <em>Music City TV</em>&#8217;s Brad Schmitt <a href="http://musiccitytv.com/2008/12/10/despite-report-tim-mcgraw-wont-run-for-guv-in-2010/">was told it ain&#8217;t gonna happen</a>. If, or when, McGraw decides to throw his shiny, black cowboy hat into the gubernatorial political race he won&#8217;t be the first country star to have done so in Tennessee. Ok, maybe he will, but the original &#8220;King of Country Music,&#8221; <strong>Roy Acuff</strong>, also ran for governor (sans shiny, black cowboy hat), <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081211/COLUMNIST0101/812110353/-1/">and despite his enormous popularity</a>, he was handily defeated.</li>
<li><em>Country Aircheck</em> is reporting this afternoon that WhiteStar Entertainment, the label home of <strong>George Ducas</strong> and <strong>Jason Meadows</strong> is dissolving.<br />
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Employees haven&#8217;t been paid and President/CEO JC Lestorti has been unreachable for some time. Calls to Lestorti&#8217;s Florida-based cabinet company had not been returned at press time.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.americanidol.com/myidol/forums/topic/?tid=1046361"><strong>Kristy Lee Cook</strong> and Arista/Nashville have called it quits for a second time.</a></li>
<li>In celebration of their half-century existence, Warner Bros. Records released a 10-disc box set titled <em>Revolutions In Sound: Warner Bros. Records — The First 50 Years</em>. The set takes a multi-genre approach and is arranged chronologically. For example, you&#8217;ll find John Anderson’s &#8220;Swingin’&#8221; positioned between the Pretenders’ &#8220;Middle Of The Road&#8221; and Elton John’s &#8220;I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues.&#8221; <a href="http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5939626,00.html">Out of the 199 tracks, GAC culled a list of the 16 country and country-related recordings.</a></li>

<li><a href="http://musictomes.blogspot.com/2008/12/interview-with-chad-berry.html"><em>Music Tomes</em>&#8216; C. Eric Banister published an interview with Chad Berry</a>, author of <em>The Hayloft Gang</em>, a book that &#8220;draws together the work of several scholars to examine the place and importance of Chicago&#8217;s National Barn Dance.&#8221; Banister notes that the dance preceded the Grand Ole Opry and served as an influential exporter of country music in the 1930&#8217;s and 1940&#8217;s.<br />
<blockquote><p><strong>Why do you feel that the National Barn Dance is often relegated to a lower tier when country music history is discussed?</strong></p>
<p>I think the “Nashville paradigm” is powerful. There are hundreds of millions of dollars behind it. Once it was established, after World War II, it simply became easy for many folks to believe that “country music” was born there. Our book and especially the film will check that paradigm.</p></blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.countrycalifornia.com/2008/12/sing-it-purdy-eliza-doolittle.html"><em>Country California</em>&#8217;s C.M. Wilcox calls <strong>Dwight Yoakam</strong></a> &#8220;the definition of swagger and country cool onstage but an abstruse, rambling intellectual in conversation&#8221; and says <strong>Alison Krauss</strong> &#8220;sings with all the grace and elegance of an angel but talks like a bashful Midwestern housewife.&#8221; With those two examples in mind, he asks:<br />
<blockquote><p>Which other country performers don&#8217;t sing like they speak? Whose conversational voice/style would be most surprising to a fan who had only ever heard them sing? </p></blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081210/TUNEIN/81210054/-1/">Low ticket sales have forced event organizers to cancel the <strong>Trace Adkins</strong> and <strong>Lynyrd Skynyrd</strong> New Year&#8217;s Eve concert at the Sommet Center in Nashville. </a></li>
<li><a href="http://mykindofcountry.wordpress.com/">Check out the new country blog <em>My Kind of Country</em></a>, founded by JR Journey, Rainbow and Chris D., who you might recognize from the comments section and the forums. Journey explains what you can expect:<br />
<blockquote><p>Here, you will find reviews, editorials, and discussions about the country music we love - our kind of country.  The idea is simple:  rather than write lots of negative reviews about the new music that’s coming out - because let’s face it, much of what comes out of Nashville and your country radio dial is crap - we are going to write about the music we love.  The music that moves us, drives us, and makes us laugh and cry; the music that touches us.</p></blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/yearend/2008/charts/top-country-albums.shtml"><em>Billboard</em>&#8217;s list of top country albums</a> is topped by an American institution of country music, or as they&#8217;re more commonly referred to, the <strong>Eagles</strong>. Working down the list, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, <strong>Carrie Underwood</strong>, <strong>Sugarland</strong>, <strong>George Strait</strong> and <strong>Kenny Chesney</strong> all make more than one appearance. As you can see, all is right in the world of country music.</li>

<p>If asked in 1969, a casual country music fan would likely have been unable to identify Freddie Hart. A more knowledgeable county music fan might have identified him as a good journeyman country singer, one who had made a lot of solid country recordings without ever scoring a major hit. </p>
<p>In 1969, “journeyman” would have been an extremely accurate description as Hart had been knocking about Nashville for nearly 20 years, chalking up some hits as a songwriter and charting a few records himself here and there on various labels without ever achieving sustained success. During that period he recorded for Capitol, Columbia and Kapp.</p>
<p>Born in Loachapoka, Alabama&#8211;an early Christmas present to his parents on December 21, 1926&#8211;Fred Segrest arrived in a world of near poverty, one of 15 children from a poor sharecropper&#8217;s family that struggled to make ends meet. While money was in short supply, however, a love of music, particularly country music ran deep in the Segrest family. Hart began playing guitar at the age of five, and joined the Civilian Conservation Corps at 12. At just 14 years of age he managed to enlist in the Marines and fought in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, which included action at Guam and Iwo Jima. While in the military, he earned black belts in judo and jujitsu, and made his first public appearances singing at officers clubs. </p>
<p>After leaving the military in 1946, Hart pursued a career in country music, both as a performer and as a songwriter. In 1948, he had the opportunity to meet Hank Williams, who apparently taught him something about songwriting. As Hart himself puts it, “I try to put down in my songs what every man wants to say, and what every woman wants to hear.&#8221; One of his songs, “Every Little Thing Rolled Into One,” was recorded by George Morgan during this period.</p>
<p>In 1951, Hart joined Lefty Frizzell’s band. By this time Freddie Segrest had adopted the name Freddie Hart. With the help of Frizzell and Wayne Raney, he was signed to Capitol Records in 1953. At an early Capitol session he recorded a song he had written titled “Loose Talk.” While Freddie did not score a big hit with the record, Carl Smith, one of the three or four biggest stars of the time, covered the song, taking it to #1. </p>
<p>Hart moved to Columbia Records in 1956 and appeared regularly on the <em>Town Hall Party</em>, a Los Angeles television program with Lefty Frizzell, Johnny Bond, and other country stars. Unfortunately, his records did not sell especially well for Columbia, either, although he still was writing songs that other artists recorded. During the late 1950s and early 1960s modest chart success finally occurred when songs such as &#8220;The Wall,&#8221; &#8220;Chain Gang&#8221; and &#8220;The Key&#8217;s in the Mailbox&#8221; charted. “The Wall,” a self-penned number, is probably best remembered today as one of the songs sung by Johnny Cash on the classic <em>Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison</em> album. </p>
<p>During this same period, a number of Freddie Hart-penned songs became hits for other artists including “Willie the Weeper,” a #5 hit for Billy Walker; “Loose Talk,” a #4 hit for the duo of Buck Owens &#038; Rose Maddox; “My Tears Are Overdue,” a #15 hit for George Jones; and, although not a hit, a significant copyright in  “Lovin’ In Vain,” the B-side of Patsy Cline’s #1 hit “I Fall To Pieces.”  </p>
<p>Hart moved to Monument Records in 1963 for two singles, followed by a move to Kapp Records in 1965, where he recorded some more great material, but found only modest hits with &#8220;Hank Williams&#8217; Guitar&#8221; (1965), &#8220;Born A Fool&#8221; (1968) and &#8220;Togetherness&#8221; (1968). During this period, Porter Wagoner scored a #3 hit with Hart’s “Skid Row Joe.” </p>
<p>Hoping for bigger and better things, he re-signed with Capitol in 1969, where the first three singles issued showed some promise, leading Capitol to issue an album titled <em>New Sounds</em>. This was quickly followed by <em>California Grapevine</em>, with the title track being issued as the first single off the album. Unfortunately, “California Grapevine” stiffed as a single, reaching only #68 on the charts, far worse than any of three singles Capitol had previously released on Hart and worse than the singles on Kapp had performed. Consequently, Capitol dropped Freddie Hart from the label. </p>
<p>During the months following his drop from Capitol, disc jockey Jim Clemens at WPLO in Atlanta started playing an album track, buried on side two of the album, which he found interesting. Soon, other disc jockeys followed suit and before long the song was receiving massive airplay in some areas. The song contained the rather daring phrase (for the time) “so sexy looking” in its lyrics. Capitol hastily re-inked Hart to the label and issued the former album track “Easy Loving” as a single (#1 Country/#17 Pop) and issued an album by the same name that gathered up all of the previous recent Capitol singles and about half of the <em>California Grapevine</em> album. This kicked off a six year run at the top for Freddie Hart that included a dozen top-five singles (including six #1s), two CMA awards, two ACM awards and a Grammy. Concurrent with signing to Capitol, Hart signed with Buck Owens&#8217; management and publishing companies and provided the Buck Owens-Susan Raye duet with a #12 hit in “Togetherness.”</p>
<p>Since Hart was already nearly 45 years old by the time he hit it big, he figured to have a relatively short shelf life at the top, although he continued to have decent sized hits throughout the 1970s, and continued charting into the 1980s. His last top twenty hit occurred with “Sure Thing” on the Sunbird label in 1980.     </p>
<p>Freddie Hart is now 82 years old and hasn’t been an active performer in recent years. His 1970s successes set him up financially to get into other endeavors, including recording some Gospel music. Somehow, I doubt that too many of today’s performers would have the patience to persevere for the 18 years it took Freddie Hart to break through, and I doubt that many would be given the opportunity to try. While he is largely forgotten today, Freddie Hart did get to experience his day in the sun and is still remembered by some including the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, where he was inducted in 2001. </p>
<p>He made some truly unforgettable music.       </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>CDs</strong><br />
Like many 1970s County Music stars, Freddie Hart has been poorly served on CD. </p>
<p>There is an excellent Bear Family CD covering his early Capitol and Columbia years (1953-1962) titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Juke-Joint-Boogie-Freddie-Hart/dp/B0006FFS6K?tag=the9513-20"><em>Juke Joint Boogie</em></a>. The CD is expensive (roughly $24) but it does contain 33 tracks and Bear’s product is always terrific.</p>
<p>For the Capitol years, in 1995 the Dutch label Disky issued a CD of the Capitol albums <em>Easy Loving</em> and its follow-up <em>My Hang-Up Is You</em>. There is also a self-produced CD (the “label” is Richard Davis Management) of the Capitol hits (original recordings) titled <em>Hart to Hearts</em>, containing 25 tracks including eleven of Freddie’s Capitol era hits, plus 14 other tracks. Various EMI/Capitol labels have issued smaller hit collections containing ten songs (<em>Ten Best</em>, <em>Best Of&#8230;</em>, etc).</p>
<p>(Memo to Richard Weitze at Bear Family: a Freddie Hart box-set is needed!) </p>
<p>The Sunbird years at the end of Freddie’s career are represented by a <em>Best of Freddie Hart</em> collection issued by CEMA Special Markets in 1994. </p>
<p>Nothing is available for Freddie specifically covering the Kapp years. </p>
<p>For vinyl lovers, you can usually find some of Freddie’s Capitol and Kapp recordings at used record stores. Such places as Phonolux in Nashville, Rock ‘n Roll Heaven &#038; Retro Records in Orlando and Vinyl Fever in Tampa are good places to look.</p>
<p>Columbia issued only one album, <em>The Spirited Freddie Hart</em>, while Freddie was with the label, but subsequently issued several albums on the budget Harmony label</p>
<p>Freddie does have an official website at <a href="http://computermasters-r.us/fh/index.php">http://computermasters-r.us/fh/index.php</a> but he doesn’t sell any product on it, at least not yet.</p>

Whereas Adkins’ previous albums have touched on redemption and reflection in passing, <em>X</em> puts those issues front and center. In fact, a majority of the album is comprised of truly outstanding material, which includes the sincere “All I Ask For Anymore,” and the fantastic Larry Cordle (of “Murder on Music Row” fame) co-written stone country ballad “Sometimes a Man Takes a Drink.” [...] With <em>X</em>, Adkins soars above our expectations and shatters our notions of what he’s capable of. <em>X</em> is a wonderful country record. &#8212; Jim Malec<br />

A brilliantly mixed album that is underlined throughout by the standout guitar work of bandmate Matt Slusher, Hayden’s latest is one of a rare breed, so good at certain points that it’s easy to forget you’re listening to the songs of a regionally successful Texas act and not a country music legend. &#8212; Jim Malec<br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anything-Goes-Randy-Houser/dp/B001COVD9A?tag=the9513-20"><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/randy-houser-anything-goes-90.jpg' alt='Randy Houser - Anything Goes' style="float: right; margin: 3px 0 0 10px" /></a> <a href="http://www.the9513.com/album-review-randy-houser-anything-goes/"><strong>Randy Houser - <em>Anything Goes</em></strong></a><br />
The themes on <em>Anything Goes</em> are atypical to contemporary country music, which would be a refreshing change of pace, but too often the songs settle for being different instead of superior. Randy Houser shows flashes of brilliance, but as demonstrated by his debut album, he lacks focus and needs to quit occupying the same territory as acts like Dunn and Toby Keith at their worst. &#8212; Brady Vercher<br />
<img src="http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/themes/9513v3/images/stars/white/stars-212.gif" alt="2.5 Stars" /></p>
<p style="border-top: 1px solid #e1dfd6; padding-top: 1em">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Randy-Owen/dp/B001GAO5F4?tag=the9513-20"><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/randy-owen-one-on-one-90.jpg' alt='Randy Owen - One on One' style="float: right; margin: 3px 0 0 10px" /></a> <a href="http://www.the9513.com/album-review-randy-owen-one-on-one/"><strong>Randy Owen - <em>One on One</em></strong></a><br />
Although Owen says Alabama isn’t finished recording as a group, he felt he needed his own new direction. Do such goals lead to quality music, and is he chasing radio success in order to remain in the public conscious? The answer is that the quality on <em>One On One</em> varies, but nothing really stands out as exceptional, mostly fading into filler status. […] Owen had a hand in writing seven of the eleven tracks, but he says he never stopped writing during [Alabama’s] hiatus, which makes this collection of songs rather disappointing considering the amount of time he’s had to put material together. &#8212; Brady Vercher<br />

Only in a strange world where[…]Brad Paisley’s tinny tone and pre-fab vocal interpretation would qualify him as country music’s finest male vocalist, and where Kenny Chesney’s pseudo-philosophic tropical-themed “Jimmy Buffet for soccer moms” music (and beach ball stadium tours) makes him the genre’s greatest entertainer, only in that absurd world would Brad Paisley’s <em>Play</em> be considered anything other than a complete disaster. &#8212; Ben Cisneros<br />
<img src="http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/themes/9513v3/images/stars/white/stars-1.gif" alt="1 Stars" /></p>
<p style="border-top: 1px solid #e1dfd6; padding-top: 1em">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startin-Fires-Blake-Shelton/dp/B001GIJRNQ?tag=the9513-20"><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/blake-shelton-startin-fires-90.jpg' alt='Blake Shelton - Startin Fires' style="float: right; margin: 3px 0 0 10px" /></a> <strong><a href="http://www.the9513.com/album-review-blake-shelton-startin-fires/">Blake Shelton - <em>Startin&#8217; Fires</em></a></strong><br />
The album’s production is marked by similar consistency, with most of the songs occupying the same mid-tempo, countrypolitan-meets-new-traditional sonic territory. This is a space where Shelton sounds good and clearly feels at home, but producer Scott Hendricks would have done well to mix things up a bit in the interest of giving fans a more dynamic listening experience. The sonic and thematic consistency (verging on repetitiveness) of the whole means that songs and performances that might be excellent in themselves become hard to differentiate or, even worse, occasionally even forgettable in context. &#8212; CM Wilcox<br />

Taylor Swift’s much anticipated sophomore album finds her at a point of transition, on the brink of two very different and conflicting musical directions—one of which builds on the foundation of her enormously successful self-titled debut, while the other dismisses that foundation entirely. Fearless is a slightly bipolar album that dips its feet into both pools, Swift seemingly caught between the girl she was and the woman she’s becoming, unsure of which path to embrace musically. &#8212; Jim Malec<br />

Since “19 Somethin’”, Mark Wills has been tossing out singles to country radio with very little success, which makes his latest album release, <em>Familiar Strange</em>r, feel like a forced effort.  Despite the efforts of an A-list group of songwriters like Jeffrey Steele, Brett James, and Aimee Mayo, there’s no stand-out material.  The record lacks any traces of fluidity and originality, which is a shame because Wills continues to be a solid country vocalist. &#8212; Pierce Greenberg<br />

The Zac Brown Band could easily be described as country music’s feel-good story of 2008. A typically hard-working, long-touring regional band that has worked its way up to a major label record deal, the Atlanta based five-piece has already scored a top five hit on country radio with lead single “Chicken Fried.” Despite the band’s early success, however, its Atlantic debut, <em>The Foundation</em>, which features everything from Latino-infused flare to reggae breakdowns to radio-friendly country, sometimes blurs the line between diversity and inconsistency. &#8212; Pierce Greenberg<br />

<h2 class="title">Other Albums Released In November</h2>
</p>
<p></ br></p>
<p><strong>Beth Stevens - <em>Strong Enough</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://kevinoliver.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/beth-stevens-on-the-edge-of-bluegrass/">Music That Matters</a>: &#8220;<em>Strong Enough</em>…takes the traditional bluegrass of [Steven's] youth in the Stevens Family band and marries it to the more contemporary acoustic country/bluegrass of the album she did with her sister.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Boxmasters - <em>Christmas Cheer</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=1004850&#038;aid=1186541">All Music Guide</a>: &#8220;Clocking in at just under 33 minutes, this is a mercifully short set. Along with standards such as &#8220;Silver Bells&#8221; (where Thornton does his best Buck Owens and doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to the master)…[there] are some novel inclusions such as a cover of John Prine&#8217;s &#8220;Christmas in Prison,&#8221; which is done in Bakersfield style but fails to match the humorous irony of the original. There&#8217;s also a closing honky tonk read of John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#8217;s &#8220;Happy X-Mas (War Is Over),&#8221; where Thornton sounds like a cross between Bob Dylan with a cold and his character in the film Bad Santa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Churchmen - <em>I&#8217;ll Be Long Gone</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3978">Country Standard Time</a>: &#8220;…Their message is clearly the gospel delivered in a bluegrass format &#8211;the songs are of hope, inspiration and faith.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ian Tyson - <em>Yellowhead to Yellowstone and Other Love Stories</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/534343">Toranto Star</a>: &#8220;…This is Tyson, apparently unrestrained by age–he turned 75 in September–and the astonishing effects of irreparable vocal cord damage caused a year ago. The voice may be unrecognizable–it seems higher, more conversational in tone, though as pitch-true as ever–but it&#8217;s well suited to these folk-derived melodies and lusty tales of rough riding and heartache.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Adams - <em>Cardinology</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=1567">Slant</a>: &#8220;Smooth and mostly sunny, <em>Cardinology</em> hums along on the fumes of better Ryan Adams material, infrequently surprising us with something glittering in its own tepid milieu&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Western Fifth - <em>Stand Like a Thief</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://howwastheshow.blogspot.com/2008/11/western-fifth-releases-their-second-cd.html">HowWasTheShow</a>: &#8220;Open up the liner notes and view the album artwork by Jeremiah Talamantes and you see a lonely gray house on a dark prairie. A despondent gentlemen stands in the foreground in a top hat looking down at the ground. The cover art couldn&#8217;t be a better match for the music inside.&#8221;</p>

<li><strong>Lady Antebellum</strong>, <strong>James Otto</strong>, <strong>Kellie Pickler</strong>, <strong>Chuck Wicks</strong> and <strong>The Zac Brown Band</strong> have been announced as the <a href="http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1600930/acts-named-for-crs-new-faces-show.jhtml">performers for the CRS-40 New Faces of Country Music Show</a> on Friday, March 6, 2009. Country Radio Seminar (CRS) is an annual industry convention aimed at radio programmers, personalities and executives and the New Faces show is designed to help new artists, who have achieved significant success at country radio, solidify relationships with country radio programmers.</li>
<li><em>The Tennessean</em>&#8217;s Cindy Watts reviewed <strong>Carrie Underwood</strong>&#8217;s headlining <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081209/ENTERTAINMENT0106/812090364/-1/">performance at the Sommet Center in Nashville on Sunday night</a> and says the former <em>American Idol</em> winner has undeniable talent, but there&#8217;s still room to grow.<br />
<blockquote><p>The lesser-known songs slowed the pace of her show at times — with Underwood&#8217;s career yet in its early stages, less-avid listeners of her CDs found themselves facing a slew of songs with which they weren&#8217;t familiar. It&#8217;s not that Underwood&#8217;s album tracks are weak, but audience members who&#8217;ve become accustomed to sing-along-studded arena shows might&#8217;ve felt less engaged.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><a href="http://texasmusicmatters.kut.org/2008/12/09/dave-alvin-two-lucky-bums/">Listen to <strong>Dave Alvin</strong>&#8217;s &#8220;Two Lucky Bums,&#8221; a song he recently re-dedicated to his longtime friend and collaborator, <strong>Chris Gaffney</strong>, who died in April.</a></li>
<li><strong>Randy Kohrs</strong>&#8216; Left of Center Records <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hornographycd">released a new mostly-instrumental album today</a> titled <em>Hornography: A Tribute To Master Luthier Tim Scheerhorn</em>. It contains 17 tracks with nearly 50 musicians performing bluegrass, classical, country and blues.</li>
<li><strong>Charlie Louvin</strong> also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Louvin-Murder-Ballads-Disaster/dp/B001N8ARW4?tag=the9513-20">released a new album today on which he sings murder ballads and disaster songs</a>, in fact, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called &#8212; <em>Sings Murder Ballads and Disaster Songs</em>. Several of the songs were culled from previous Louvin Brothers releases. </li>
<li>NashvilleGab uncovered videos of <a href="http://www.nashvillegab.com/2008/12/john-rich-sings-patriotic-new-song.html"><strong>John Rich</strong>&#8217;s visit with Bama, Rob, &#038; Heather at KASE 101</a> in which he explained his version of what went down in his fight a couple of months ago in Los Angeles. &#8220;I had to bust him right in his big ole ugly face,&#8221; he said about rocker Jerry Montano, who filed a lawsuit against Rich last month for breaking a bottle across his nose. Rich also played a new song about his grandad for the morning crew titled &#8220;The Man,&#8221; and said it&#8217;s probably the best song he&#8217;s ever written.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.countryweekly.com/taylor_swift/news/3498"><strong>Taylor Swift</strong> fans deciphered a secret message from random capital letters throughout the liners notes of <em>Fearless</em>.</a></li>
<li>Tim Carter, the owner of the land where the famous Bristol recordings once took place, rejected a bid of $67,500 for the corner parking lot, in hopes that he&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.tricities.com/tri/news/local/article/owner_of_historic_country_music_site_rejects_bid/17303/">be able to market the property to the country music industry</a>. A local law firm bought two other pieces of real estate from Carter and placed the bid for the historic site a well. “I did not sell them the corner lot,” Carter said. “They were p—-ed, but business is business, right?”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96581453">Listen to <strong>Old Crow Medicine Show</strong>&#8217;s performance on the stage at <em>World Cafe</em>.</a></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/X-TEN-Trace-Adkins/dp/B001G4K6CQ?tag=the9513-20"><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/trace-adkins-x.jpg' alt='Trace Adkins - X' style="margin: 3px 10px 0 0; float: left" /></a>If you’re not into Roman numerals (though, let’s face it, who isn’t?), the name of Trace Adkins’ latest album represents its chronological place within the singer’s discography. Of course, <em>X</em> is only technically accurate if we’re including Adkins’ two greatest hits packages in our calculations (which we usually don’t when counting an artist’s albums). Without those, this would only be Adkins’ eighth album. I guess <em>VIII</em> just doesn’t have the same zing. </p>
<p>That’s not to say, however, that <em>X</em> isn’t a fitting title. This collection plots a point well off the slope set by Adkins’ previous work, and <em>X</em> seems appropriate considering that the album is stronger, that it takes more risks, and that it’s more emotionally affecting than any of Adkins’ first seven studio releases. </p>
<p>It’s because Adkins is one of the genre’s most consistent artists, however, that <em>X</em> is somehow unsettling. We expect our favorite behemoth baritone to put forth decent work that follows a very specific pattern—Adkins is about mainstream radio ditties with the occasional power ballad tossed into the mix. His music is pleasant, sometimes great to dance to, often irreverent, but rarely truly gripping. Even the first single from this project, “Muddy Water” (which is the last track on the album) aptly does what it sets out to do without being really memorable or particularly moving. </p>
<p>But there have been a few rare cases where the mild mannered Adkins has Hulked up and released something stronger than anyone expected. He catches us off guard in those moments of excellence, moments which notably include his seriously underappreciated “Arlington,” a song that was outperformed on the charts by classics like “Hot Mama” and “Chrome.”</p>
<p><em>X</em> certainly has its share of ditties; Opener “Sweet” sounds like the creative offspring of a John Rich protégé and someone who really, really likes making lists of things, and the forgettable mid-tempo “Let’s Do That Again” is the most boring kind of groovy.</p>
<p>Likewise, “Marry for Money” can be classified as nothing other than ditty&#8211;although there’s something telling about its inclusion on the project. After all, major Nashville labels in today’s environment generally avoid releasing songs that are intentionally silly. When was the last time you heard something from a hitmaking mainstream artist that was purposely ridiculous? “Marry for Money” is silly to the point that it’s ridiculous, but in some bizarre way, it works. And it demonstrates that here Adkins is willing to take some chances, to tweak the rules of engagement just enough to make this album something that is unexpected and engaging.</p>
<p>And in doing so he reaches a level of excellence that he has achieved only spottily in the past.  </p>
<p>There’s an almost unheard of diversity of material on <em>X</em>, from the Funkabilly groove of “Better Than I Thought It’d Be” (on which, in the song’s intro, Adkins’ seemingly gives a nod to Funkabilly matriarch Joanna Cotten), to the heavy truckin’ “Haulin’ One Thing,” to the up-tempo, quasi-Honky Tonk/contemporary country hybrid “Hillbilly Rich.”</p>
<p>All of those songs carve out a unique musical space, and each is fun in its own way. Of course, each is also more or less unfocused clutter—I have no idea, for instance, why there’s a lyrically cliché trucking song on this album—but the clutter is interesting enough to keep our attention while Adkins gets to the good stuff. The <em>really</em> good stuff. </p>
<p>Adkins’ best work is tied together by themes of redemption and reflection. When he sings about maturing, about overcoming the mistakes of his past and being “happy to be here,” he does so with a gravitas that makes us believe these aren’t just stories fabricated for the sake of the song, but that he’s lived every word. </p>
<p>And whereas Adkins’ previous albums have touched on these issues in passing, <em>X</em> puts them front and center. In fact, a majority of the album is comprised of truly outstanding material, which includes the sincere “All I Ask For Anymore,” and the fantastic Larry Cordle (of “Murder on Music Row” fame) co-written stone country ballad “Sometimes a Man Takes a Drink.” </p>
<p><em>X</em>’s most brightly shining moment, however, comes on the back-to-back pairing of “’Till The Last Shot’s Fired” and “I Can’t Outrun You,” two songs which producer Frank Rogers beautifully plays off each other, each discussing a certain kind of ghost—the former told from the voice of fallen soldiers who ask us to pray for peace, the later the voice of a lover that relentlessly haunts the singer’s heart. </p>
<p>Rogers is the best mainstream producer in the game right now, and he proves why here—both songs are perfectly sparse, “I Can’t Outrun You” almost unprecedentedly so.  </p>
<p>Rogers does make one giant misstep, however—“’Till The Last Shot’s Fired” closes with an incredibly bizarre choral track that is supposed to be a manifestation of the voices of the fallen soldiers, but the arrangement makes the soldiers sound like chanting monks who are very concerned with proper enunciation. (Who knew ghosts had such strong diction?) </p>
<p>Aside from that, there is the fact that Adkins is already singing the song from from the perspective, and in the voice, of those soldiers. When the creepy choir jumps in and attempts to elevate the drama, it just comes off sounding, well, creepy. It also sounds forced, as if it’s trying to hammer home a point that it thinks we might not otherwise get. To that end, it undoes much of the sincerity that Adkins brings to his exquisite performance. </p>
<p>Still, it’s a truly affecting song, and the cornerstone of what is by far the best album of Adkins’ career. With <em>X</em>, Adkins soars above our expectations and shatters our notions of what he’s capable of. <em>X</em> is a wonderful country record. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/loretta-lynn-930.jpg' alt='Loretta Lynn 930 Club' style="margin: 3px 10px 0 0; float: left" />WASHINGTON &#8212; Washington D.C.&#8217;s 9:30 Club first made a name for itself some thirty years ago hosting bands like Black Flag, X, and Minor Threat. Loretta Lynn is no punk rocker, but she&#8217;s been shaking up the status quo and sticking it to the man since Henry Rollins was an angry toddler. Thus it is only fitting that Lynn appear at the 9:30, and her first appearance at the club since 2002 was well worth the wait.</p>
<p>The sold out crowd was really something to behold: becardiganed hipsters shoulder to shoulder with graying geezers, all united in sheer adoration for the Coal Miner&#8217;s Daughter. Anything Lynn did was received with thunderous applause: drinking from her water bottle, forgetting the words to &#8220;You Ain&#8217;t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),&#8221; threatening to give her son a whupping, it didn&#8217;t matter. </p>
<p>And that adoration is well earned, because after forty-five years in the music business Loretta Lynn can still belt out a song like a singer half her age. For 90 minutes she wowed the audience with nearly all of her hits, from &#8220;Honky Tonk Girl&#8221; to &#8220;Portland Oregon,&#8221; with a few surprises thrown in, such as her version of the Bellamy Brothers&#8217; hit &#8220;Let Your Love Flow,&#8221; with which she opened her show. She and her male backup singers also formed a quartet for a few gospel songs sung with all the fervor of a tent revival. </p>
<p>Aside from her solo hits, Lynn donated a fair amount of her set to the songs she sang with Conway Twitty, her son Ernest joining her on a rather inappropriate mother-child duet of &#8220;Feelins,&#8221; and rhythm guitarist Bert Hansen sang Twitty&#8217;s part on &#8220;Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man.&#8221; Lynn then shared with the crowd the story of Twitty&#8217;s death; Lynn&#8217;s husband, Doo, had suffered a heart attack in Branson and was admitted to the hospital in Springfield. On his way to visit the Lynns at the hospital, Twitty passed out and died of an aneurysm. Both Lynn and audience were briefly subdued after that, but things quickly picked up again, thanks in part to some banter with both her son and the crowd. </p>
<p>Indeed, Loretta Lynn&#8217;s show is a family affair, and it&#8217;s apparent that the 74 year-old singer feels strongly about making sure that the rest of her clan has moments in the spotlight. The trouble is that the rest of the family doesn&#8217;t have her talent, nor do they possess her inherent charm. Twin daughters Patsy and Peggy, AKA The Lynns (who charted two singles from a self-titled 1998 Reprise album), performed in a manner reminiscent of the Kinleys (blandly inoffensive, the aural equivalent of Cheerios), and were preceded by brother Ernest singing Toby Keith&#8217;s &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t As Good As I Once Was&#8221; like a drunk at karaoke night. </p>
<p>Worst of all was Lynn&#8217;s granddaughter, Tayla, a 20-something who screeched her way through feminist anthem &#8220;Rated X&#8221; whilst shaking her ass, twirling her hair, and otherwise coming off as an even less talented Kellie Pickler. </p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say it, I think Lynn&#8217;s touring days are drawing to an end. She appeared frail under her lavender rhinestone gown, requiring frequent breaks and sitting in a chair onstage while her children and bandmembers sang a song or two at a time. In addition to forgetting the lyrics of multiple songs, Lynn launched into &#8220;You&#8217;re Looking at Country&#8221; before being halted by a band member, apparently forgetting that she had just sung it not ten minutes before. </p>
<p>Despite these occasional moments of dottiness, however, Loretta can still sing with the best of them, and her frailness serves as a harsh reminder: In the past few years we&#8217;ve lost so many country music legends&#8211;go see your heroes while you still can.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I appreciate the honor, don&#8217;t get me wrong,&#8221; said Jones, 77, sitting in a favorite chair in his Williamson County home. &#8220;But I feel kind of out of place. It seems like there&#8217;s a lot of people that would deserve it more than I do. I messed up my life way back there, drinking and boozing and all that kind of stuff, and you wish you could just erase it all. You can&#8217;t do that, though. You just have to live it down the best you can.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.twangnation.com/2008/12/07/tom-russell-berkley-california-120608/"><em>Twang Nation</em>&#8217;s Baron Lane got his first taste of Berkley, California via a <strong>Tom Russell</strong> concert on Saturday night</a>:<br />
<blockquote><p>San Antonio’s Michael Martin provided intricately dazzling guitar and mandolin workto counter the hard tales Russell sang of illegal Mexican workers (Who’s Gonna Build Your Wall?) grappling with mortality (The Pugilist at 59) and the pain of love (Down the Rio Grande and Navajo Rug.) Many of the songs are autobiographical and the gritty roads and and tequila soaked rendezvous are all palpable. If Willie Nelson is Texas’ Django Reinhardt then Russell is the states’ adopted Jack Kerouac.</p></blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1600810/mary-chapin-carpenter-offers-an-illuminating-christmas-album.jhtml"><strong>Mary Chapin Carpenter</strong> on her new Christmas album, <em>Come Darkness, Come Light</em>, to <em>CMT</em>&#8217;s Craig Shelburne</a>:
<p>&#8220;That was the whole point from the beginning &#8212; to make a real acoustic record. Whatever instruments we thought might add a texture or color, John [Jennings -- co-producer] was able to provide himself. We brought in Jon Carroll, my longtime keyboard player. He is so gifted, and he really did the heavy lifting on the piano, but John was able to fill in where it was needed. At most, there were three people in the room, but mostly it was me and John. It&#8217;s really fun to do that. You feel like you&#8217;re wacky scientists, late at night in the lab, experimenting to your heart&#8217;s content.</li>
<li>In this week&#8217;s &#8220;Quotable Country,&#8221; <em>Country California</em>&#8217;s C.M. Wilcox highlights quotes from <strong>Lady Antebellums</strong>&#8216; Charles Kelley in which he reveals Dave Haywood&#8217;s fascination with the Jonas Brothers and <a href="http://www.countrycalifornia.com/2008/12/quotable-country-120708-edition.html">Bill Richardson describing dinner with <strong>Toby Keith</strong></a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/music/6149355.html"><strong>Bruce Robison</strong> has a particular affinity for the Christmas shows</a> that he does each year since they&#8217;re one of the few opportunities he has to share the stage with his wife <strong>Kelly Willis</strong>. The material for the shows is fairly broad, and for good reason. Robison tells <em>The Houston Chronicle</em>&#8217;s Andre Dansby that &#8220;for a while, Cheech explaining Christmas to Chong, to me, denoted Christmas.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hearya.com/2008/12/06/those-darlins/">The <em>HearYa</em> indie music blog wants to introduce you to <strong>Those Darlins</strong></a>: &#8220;Their sound channels the traditional country sound you’d expect to hear at The Grand Ole Opry, but as dig you into the lyrics you’ll feel a punk attitude to go along with it.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/darlins">MySpace</a>)</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startin-Fires-Blake-Shelton/dp/B001GIJRNQ?tag=the9513-20"><img src='http://www.the9513.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/blake-shelton-startin-fires.jpg' alt='Blake Shelton - Startin Fires' style="margin: 3px 10px 0 0; float: left" /></a>Many savvy observers of mainstream country recognize Blake Shelton as one of the format&#8217;s finest interpreters of a song. On his fifth studio album, the Oklahoma native and beau of firecracker Miranda Lambert (a connection alluded to by the title track) does not fail to impress, offering vocal performances worthy of past career highlights like &#8220;Austin,&#8221; &#8220;Goodbye Time,&#8221; and &#8220;Home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly, this new batch of songs never quite allows Shelton to return to those artistic heights. The problem isn&#8217;t one of inconsistency&#8211;in fact, quite the opposite. The material and production is almost unfailingly solid, so seldom daring to disappoint or really excel that the songs end up bleeding together.</p>
<p>The flow of the collection is limited and repetitive, with the first three songs revealing most of what&#8217;s to come in the next eight. It begins with the country pride anthem &#8220;Green,&#8221; the lovin&#8217; groove of &#8220;Good at Startin&#8217; Fires,&#8221; and the regret-filled &#8220;She Wouldn&#8217;t Be Gone.&#8221; Then there&#8217;s the country pride anthem &#8220;Country Strong,&#8221; the lovin&#8217; groove of &#8220;This Is Gonna Take All Night,&#8221; and the regret-filled &#8220;100 Miles.&#8221; Finally, there&#8217;s the country pride anthem &#8220;Home Sweet Home,&#8221; the lovin&#8217; groove of &#8220;Never Lovin&#8217; You,&#8221; and the regret-filled &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Care&#8221; (curiously repeated from Pure BS).</p>
<p>The album&#8217;s production is marked by similar consistency, with most of the songs occupying the same mid-tempo, countrypolitan-meets-new-traditional sonic territory. This is a space where Shelton sounds good and clearly feels at home, but producer Scott Hendricks would have done well to mix things up a bit in the interest of giving fans a more dynamic listening experience. The sonic and thematic consistency (verging on repetitiveness) of the whole means that songs and performances that might be excellent in themselves become hard to differentiate or, even worse, occasionally even forgettable in context.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the album&#8217;s finest moment is the one in which it dares to stray from its established course. The album-ending duet with Lambert on &#8220;Bare Skin Rug&#8221; (recorded in an intimate fireside setting) is affecting and quirky and everything else an album by an interesting character like Shelton should be. If he had taken a few more chances like that, <em>Startin&#8217; Fires</em> could have been something really special.</p>
<p>Instead, it&#8217;s just very good, expertly-sung contemporary country that manages to satisfy even as it refuses to challenge convention or try anything especially new&#8211;such music certainly has its place.</p>
