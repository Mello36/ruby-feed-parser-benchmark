<p>I have learned an important lesson of comedy:  You have to do things for yourself.  There aren&#8217;t a lot of comedians out there that are willing to put their neck out on the line to help someone make the next step in the business.  There are a few of those guys around and they are awesome, but you have to make your own luck and work your butt off making your own connections.</p>
<p>So hopefully, I&#8217;ll make the connections I need to get out on the road more.  I have been getting advice from a lot of good comics which is something I appreciate.  One thing a comic is never short on is advice.  Everyone seems to have their own theories on how the business works and it&#8217;s a little different for everybody.  The trick is finding what works for you.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m rambling on here and I guess I better finish it up.  I&#8217;ll just keep working hard and hope that eventually it&#8217;ll pay off.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_334" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 199px"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-334" title="end_of_the_world_2_small" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/end_of_the_world_2_small.jpg" alt="&quot;I feel fine.&quot;" width="189" height="134" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;I feel fine.&quot;</p></div>
<p>I slept in today which was nice.  I knew that while I was sleeping there were stupid people all over the country frantically trying to get a good deal on a TV or iPod.  I was horrified when I finally got up and started looking at headlines.  Two headlines caught my eye immediately.</p>
<p>The first one was a story about the hostages that were killed in Mumbai, India at a Jewish center.  Men, women, and children were shot by terrorists.  I can&#8217;t imagine the horror of being in that situation and knowing that these crazy gunmen could not be reasoned with and that my life would be soon coming to an end.  Muslim extremists are becoming more and more aggresive towards Jewish people and communities.  I don&#8217;t know what I can do from where I am right now.  It is horrible to feel as helpless against such violent acts as I do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, what are we worried about?  The other headline I saw was about a worker at a Long Island Walmart being trampled to death by a stampede of bargain hungry maniacs.  This seriously made me want to scream.  I can&#8217;t believe that we sit here while people are being murdered by psycopaths and all we care about is saving an extra ten dollars on our new TV.  What has happened to this country?  I give up on it.  I don&#8217;t think there is any going back to the ideals that make(made) this country great.  I don&#8217;t like to wax political, but this is ridiculous.  The greed of this country makes me want a meteor to come destroy this planet.  The world is in a downward spiral and there is nothing that is going to change it.  The greed, pride, and indifference of our world leaders and the people of the world in general have led me to believe that it would be better for the world to be destroyed by a meteor than for us to continue on our current course.  The only thing that we are headed for is more war, death, and destruction.</p>
<p>Shame on all of you who were involved in any type of mob activity while trying to get a good deal this morning.  I hope that you feel happy with your new TV or X-box.  I hope you feel happy knowing that your greed and utter disregard for others cost at least one life that I know about and countless other injuries.  I&#8217;ll see you in hell, cuz that&#8217;s where this world is headed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_330" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 86px"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-330" title="turkey" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/turkey.jpg" alt="turkey  Its good to be thankful" width="76" height="61" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#39;m going to eat you!</p></div>
<p>Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I can&#8217;t believe it is already that time of year when all we want to do is stuff our faces with lots and lots of turkey. Then we can just sit back relax and watch a good football game.  Of course the Cowboys and the Lions aren&#8217;t doing too well this year. So, instead of watching a football game I&#8217;ll probably just watch my father-in-law sleep on the couch and take pictures of his open, drooling mouth.</p>
<p>During this time of year I like to think about those things that I am thankful for.  And now, my Top Ten List of Things I&#8217;m Thankful For in 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>10.  My cat, Milo.  Every time I forget what pain is, you remind me.</p>
<p>9.  Tina Fey.  Thank you for being sexy AND smart.</p>
<p>8.  Jessica Simpson.  Thank you for being sexy and making ME feel smart.</p>
<p>7.  Whoever decided to put a slice of raw fish on some rice and then charge a sickeningly high price for it.</p>
<p>6.  Sarah Palin.  Thanks for opening your mouth and slitting the throat of the Republican party.</p>
<p>5.  Prison Break and Heroes.  Thanks for showing us how to drag out seemingly simple plots into never-ending black holes of ridiculous storylines and stupid twists.</p>
<p>4.  Twinkies</p>
<p>3.  My sister.  Thanks for having your baby and taking the pressure off me to produce grandchildren.</p>
<p>2.  Comedy.  Thanks for being a cruel and sexy temptress that no matter what I do, I can&#8217;t get enough of it.</p>
<p>1.  My wife.  Seriously, if I didn&#8217;t put her at number one I&#8217;d be in serious trouble.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, there you have it folks I hope you have a good Thanksgiving.  Be safe and don&#8217;t forget to come see a show when I come to your town.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_320" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 183px"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-320" title="gogreenicon" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gogreenicon.jpg" alt="gogreenicon How Im Going Green" width="173" height="175" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Going green is cool!</p></div>
<p>So, it seems that the new &#8216;in&#8217; thing to do in Hollywood and among the celebrity elite is to &#8216;go green&#8217;.  I, of course, am always trying to make sure that I live like a celebrity in order to be one in the future.  This means that I will now be making some adjustments in my daily routine in order to &#8216;go green&#8217;.</p>
<p>Now, by &#8216;going green&#8217; I mean altering my current lifestyle in order to lower my &#8216;carbon footprint&#8217; on the environment.  First off, I didn&#8217;t know this at first, so I&#8217;ll be returning my new entirely green wardrobe tomorrow and getting normal clothes to replace all the ones I just burned in my backyard.  At this point I&#8217;d like to mention the fact that I didn&#8217;t actually know what the term &#8216;carbon footprint&#8217; meant.  If I had known, I wouldn&#8217;t have burnt all those clothes, and by doing so, released a ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere thus contributing to air pollution in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>So anywho, here is a list of things that I have done to &#8216;go green&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. <strong>Save water</strong> - I have cut my shower time in half by not just standing under the water in the shower until the hot water runs out.  As soon as I&#8217;m done washing myself, I turn off the water.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Save food</strong> - I now eat leftovers almost every meal.  This is kind of hard because I have to get leftovers from unconventional places like the dumpsters behind restaurants.  The plus side is I get great gourmet food, or parts of it.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Save gas</strong> - One way to save gas that has helped me is by hitch-hiking.  I know this isn&#8217;t a popular way to go, but it does have it&#8217;s advantages.  Last week I found out the difference between crack and regular cocaine.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I hope you guys are all trying to do your part.  Remember, it&#8217;s cool to &#8216;go green&#8217; because celebrities like me are doing it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, as you may know, it rains a lot in the Seattle area.  We were introduced to the rain early and it&#8217;s been pretty damp and cloudy ever since.  On Day 2 we had to drive from Seattle to Hoquiam, which is a small town to the southwest.  We left pretty early because they were expecting 5+ inches of rain.  Boy were they right:</p>
<div id="attachment_289" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 433px"><a href="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/seattledrive1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-289" title="seattledrive1" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/seattledrive1.jpg" alt="seattledrive1 When in Western Washington..." width="423" height="317" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anyone need a drink?</p></div>
<p>On day three we made a trip to another small town, not to perform, but to taste the local food.  We ate lunch at T-Bonz Prime Rib and Steak House in Enumclaw, WA.  A very good restaurant, which featured a very large and delicious &#8217;stuffed&#8217; burger.  This thing was huge.  It was also tasty:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stuffed1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-290" title="stuffed1" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stuffed1.jpg" alt="stuffed1 When in Western Washington..." width="423" height="317" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stuffed2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-291" title="stuffed2" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stuffed2.jpg" alt="stuffed2 When in Western Washington..." width="423" height="317" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stuffed3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-292" title="stuffed3" src="http://www.spencerkingcomedian.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stuffed3.jpg" alt="stuffed3 When in Western Washington..." width="423" height="317" /></a></p>
<p>Meat is tasty.  So it&#8217;s always good to do something cultural while visiting a new place.</p>

<p>Well, here I am in Seattle taking part in Prelim Week 2 of the Seattle International Comedy Competition.  I&#8217;m staying in an extended stay place in Tukwila which is a suburb of Seattle.  Last night Todd, my roomate, and I met our fellow contestants.  It&#8217;s going to be a tough week.  I think everyone is very funny and I don&#8217;t know how this whole thing will turn out.  I didn&#8217;t do too well last night but Todd was able to take first.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to redeem myself and do better throughout the coming shows.</p>
<p>My internet connection at this hole sucks.  So I won&#8217;t be able to do too many videos.  I&#8217;ll hopefully keep updating pics though.</p>
