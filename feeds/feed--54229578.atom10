<em>&#8220;We believe that transparency in government activities leads to reduced corruption, better government and stronger democracies. All governments can benefit from increased scrutiny by the world community, as well as their own people. We believe this scrutiny requires information. Historically that information has been costly - in terms of human life and human rights. But with technological advances - the internet, and cryptography - the risks of conveying important information can be lowered.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate">Fourth Estate</a> dead?  Do powerful interests with plenty to hide have nothing to fear?  If you ask those behind <a href="https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks">WikiLeaks</a>, with your help, powerful interests will soon have nothing to hide and plenty to fear.</p>
<p>Those involved in the effort to build the &#8220;uncensorable Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis&#8221; will be speaking at the 25C3.  In <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/2916.en.html">Wikileaks vs. the World</a>, those involved in WikiLeaks will share experiences and observations gathered during their first year of operation.  It&#8217;s another one of the talks in the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/index.en.html">society track</a> at the 25C3 that fits in perfectly with this year&#8217;s theme: <a href="http://events.ccc.de/2008/08/14/25c3-nothing-to-hide/">&#8220;Nothing to Hide&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, WikiLeaks has brought us everything from <a href="https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks_exposes_Palin's_private_e-mail_account">headline-making public records violations</a>, to <a href="https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Apple_censored_iPodHash_source_code,_Nov_2008">source code</a> subject to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act">DMCA &#8220;takedown&#8221; notice</a>, <a href="https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Scientology_cult_Clear_Expansion_Committee_documents">internal Church of Scientology expansion documents</a>, and even <a href="https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Directive_on_leaks_at_the_CIA_leaked">anti-leak directives</a>.</p>
<p>The talk will also cover the legal challenges associated with these leaks, strategies for resurrecting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Hersh">investigative journalism</a> and, &#8220;why your involvement and that of the technical community is inherently important to ensuring free and uncensored access to information in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>“Everyone needs to be prepared. The speakers, the moderators and even the audience.  The speakers must know what they really want to say, the moderators must ensure a quick change between speakers and they need to set everything up so there&#8217;s no pause … the audience must be willing to listen and to forgive possible errors.”</em></p>
<p>Do you have something to say at the 25C3?  Can you say it in 5 minutes or less?  Give a <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Lightning_Talks">lightning talk</a>!  These speaker-driven, self organizing collections of short presentations are a great way to get a quick taste of a lot of wonderful topics usually hidden from mainstream view.  Scheduled presentations include everything from serious technical topics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freifunk">Freifunk</a>, and <a href="http://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS </a> to <a href="https://cchristoph.de/der-schaeuble.html">performances poking fun at political personalities</a>.  Moderated by Sven Guckes and Oliver Pritzkow, lightning talks are happening on Day 2, 3, and 4 of the 25C3.</p>
<p>According to Guckes, “any topic that you are really passionate about,&#8221; makes for a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk">lightning talk</a>.</p>
<p>“There was the ‘talk’ on then forthcoming Xbox hacks by a guy in ninja clothing.  He set up the box, started it, and it showed a combined logo of a linux penguin and a Macintosh happy face with the words ‘coming soon’.  No words spoken at all&#8211;but he said everything he needed to!”</p>
<p>For those without a flashy demo, Guckes recommends some simple techniques for maximizing the short amount of time allotted to each speaker.  He believes speaking slowly, without hesitation or repeating points, staying focused and finishing right on time are all keys to great lightning talks.  Not following any of these suggestions is key to a bad lightning talk.  Guckes recalls one lightning speaker who used 20 minutes laying the groundwork for a complex topic.</p>
<p>“He finally gave a 5 minute talk which was still totally unintelligible.  What a waste of time!,” says Guckes.</p>
<p>There are still spaces left on Day 4.  You can sign up by creating a properly formatted entry on the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Lightning_Talks">Lightning talks</a> page of the 25C3 wiki.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/images/person-2178-128x128.png" title="Christian Heller" class="alignleft" width="128" height="128" />Christian Heller aka <a href="http://www.plomlompom.de/">plomlompom</a> self-identifies as an identity and meme machine currently living the future in Berlin so you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>His talk <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/2979.en.html">Embracing Post-Privacy: Optimism towards a future where there is &#8220;Nothing to hide&#8221;</a> ponders opportunities of a world we might live in all too soon. The loss of privacy we decry now may very well transform into something very utopian: A society where the borders of &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; life are blurring and human identity itself must be redefined.</p>
<p>Born and raised in East Berlin, Christian&#8217;s life as a media person started early when he became a child TV presenter on ORB (today&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rundfunk_Berlin-Brandenburg">RBB</a>) from 1992 to 1994. Academically trained in philosophy and film studies and hardened through troll attacks on Usenet, his interests include all things futurologic: From Mars colonization to the technical singularity to questions of post-identity. </p>
<p>Christian blogs (in German) about the future at <a href="http://futur.plomlompom.de/">futur:plom</a> and movies and Internet memes at <a href="http://cine.plomlompom.de/">cine:plom</a>. He is involved with the theory and practice of co-working spaces and the future of work at the <a href="http://hallenprojekt.de/">Hallenprojekt</a>. His enthusiasm and techno-optimism, together with his witty style of critique, earned him recognition as a speaker at places so diverse as the NextCity Symposium on the future of networked cities in Graz, Austria and the Goethe Institute in Namibia.</p>
<p>While &#8220;embracing post-privacy&#8221; caused quite some controversy at the program committee that selected the talks for 25C3, the consensus was that while on first sight it may sound like an antithesis to privacy activism, it is really a necessary (and maybe heated) debate we should have. The Chaos Communication Congress is a place to think outside the box and we are happy to have Christian as a speaker. Let&#8217;s just hope he&#8217;ll be able to give us his talk before the nerd rapture (aka The Singularity) takes us all away and we all become post-human Foucauldian discourse functions, independent of bio-politics and Club-Mate.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Once upon a time, there were two young hackers attending <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_At_Large">HAL</a>. They brought along their phone switch. As occupants of neighboring tents realized they could participate in yet another means of communication, the phone network expanded rapidly. </p>
<p>Whoever thought hackers were socially isolated nerds would have been contradicted instantly at this point.  From here on, <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventphone">numerous European hacker gatherings</a> have benefited from a reliable phone network, both for fun and event organization.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>How can you stay in contact with your friends at the 25C3?  Get in touch with a project or workshop? Call back home for free?  Instantly summon help from angels?  Even preview talks going on in other rooms?  Simple!  Get a cordless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECT">DECT</a> phone and connect to the <a href="http://www.eventphone.de/">Eventphone</a> network!</p>
<p>Many attendees of CCC events find these cordless phones incredibly handy.  Where cell phone service is expensive or possibly not always available (like the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Hackcenter">Hackcenter</a>), DECT phones help keep people in touch.  Of course, they&#8217;re also another opportunity to create <a href="http://fbz.smugmug.com/keyword/magicphone#190581711_BA86w">cool and useful projects</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are even rumors of detailed DECT hacks to be presented during the conference,&#8221; says Sascha, one of the coordinators of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/POC">Phone Operations Center</a>, or POC.   &#8220;Just keep your eyes and ears open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have a DECT phone from previous congresses, you can still <a href="http://www.eventphone.de/language.php">register your 4 digit extension</a> for the 25C3.  Every DECT phone must be registered at the POC in order to be connected. </p>
<p>&#8220;The registration process is significantly faster for pre-registered numbers,&#8221; says Sascha.</p>
<p>If you need to pick up a DECT phone, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.eventphone.de:443/wiki/index.php/DECT_Phone_Compatibility_List">Eventphone compatible model</a> at the MediaMarkt across the street from the 25C3.  You can even connect your own asterisk server from the home or office to the eventphone network.  Imagine getting calls from your house phone while at the 25C3 for free!</p>
<p>All this really cool connectivity might make one wonder, why does the POC work so hard to keep us connected?</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides the satisfaction of providing a key infrastructure for hundreds of congress visitors&#8230;we get to know everyone.  People come to us and just start talking — some out of curiosity, some to interface their own telephony project with the eventphone network. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to do the same. We are looking forward to seeing you all,&#8221; says Sascha.</p>
<p>More information on the network is available at <a href="http://eventphone.de">eventphone.de</a> and the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/POC">25C3 POC wiki page</a>.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The first time I found my father&#8217;s porn I was trying to read his back issues of Mother Earth News. One day I did this while my mother was doing laundry&#8230;I was eight or nine years old.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rose White wants to find your porn stash.  She is trying to unearth how we collect, store, organize (and hide) our collections, asking what these troves say about us.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I was born a little socially miswired. I never quite understood why there should be anything wrong with talking about sex. In fourth grade I got in trouble at school for explaining to the other kids how human reproduction worked. I read it in the encyclopedia! They were wrong on the playground!,&#8221; says White.</p>
<p>Never one to shy away from topics of sexuality, Rose is presenting the initial findings of her research at the 25C3.  Her talk, &#8220;<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/2980.en.html">The Infinite Library: Storage and Access of Pornographic Information</a>&#8221; is one of many interesting events in the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/index.en.html">Society</a> track.  This track looks at many aspects of Society from a hacker&#8217;s perspective, covering everything from <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/2916.en.html">safely getting the truth out</a> to <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/3041.en.html">protecting the elections process</a> and even <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/2815.en.html">thoughts on laws a robot society needs</a>.  Fitting in with this year&#8217;s theme, there are naturally talks about <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/2872.en.html">protecting privacy</a> and talks about embracing a world where there really is <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/track/Society/2979.en.html">nothing left to hide</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-528"></span></p>
<p>Currently a student in sociology at CUNY Graduate Center, Rose is actively engaging those who have something to hide.  What our porn collections say about us is truly personal and how we store and access them are fascinating issues for Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love how this is a problem that never goes away, no matter what the medium is. People hid handwritten letters and drawings centuries ago; now they encrypt files; in between they looked for places to stash Polaroids. Everything boils down to information management and retrieval &#8212; but now there&#8217;s more information to manage, and the person who accidentally finds your porn could be sitting at a desk in a Google or Flickr office half a planet away, as Violet Blue reminded us at Arse Elektronika last year. So this is a deeply personal, individual problem, but it&#8217;s also partly a public policy issue, which makes the topic really irresistible,&#8221; says White.</p>
<p>Rose is no stranger to the congress, having spoken on <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2359.de.html">The Role of Brilliant Deviants in the Liberalization of Society</a> and <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2358.de.html">The History of Guerilla Knitting</a> at the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/">24C3</a>.  Never one to shy from a good yarn, she is also leading a Stitch &amp; Bits <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Workshops">workshop</a> on Day 1.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/index.en.html">schedule</a>, you can see the 25C3 has an <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events.en.html">incredible lineup</a> of talks on a wide range of topics from <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/2892.en.html">wearable computing</a> to <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/2773.en.html">preserving fictional former Soviet Republics</a>.  (Yes, there&#8217;s even a talk on <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/2980.en.html">pornography</a>.)</p>
<p>Yet talks are hardly the only thing going on at the 25C3.  In addition to <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Blinkenarea">wonderful displays</a> of <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Art_%26_Beauty">Art &amp; Beauty</a>, there&#8217;s going to be lots of making going on!  At the 25C3, everyone from soldering masters to hardware hacking virgins will be able to build projects of all shapes, sizes and complexity.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;ve never touched a soldering iron, you can drop by the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/MicrocontrollerWorkshop">Hardware Hacking Area</a> and get into doing cool things with microcontrollers!  Build something that <a href="http://makezine.com/10/brainwave/">relaxes your brain</a>, <a href="http://www.tvbgone.com/">turns off annoying tvs</a> with the click of a button, or just have fun making <a href="http://wiki.blinkenarea.org/index.php/BlinkstroemAdvancedEnglish">cool blinky leds</a>!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a coder who wants to get into microcontroller hardware, check out the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Game_Kit_Workshop">Game Kit Workshop</a> and build your own <a href="http://www.mignongamekit.org/">MIGNON</a>.  This open source device is perfect for beginning hardware hackers and is a great platform to write cool games for!</p>
<p>For those of you who have a few <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Hackerspaces.org#Contests">speed soldering championships</a> under your belt, why not go for something really big?  You&#8217;ll not only get to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjFkU4zDhso">see the quadrocopter in action</a> at the 25C3, you&#8217;ll have a chance to build your own at the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Build_a_Quadrocopter">Build a Quadrocopter Workshop</a>.  A real UAV you can fly outside the bcc only takes five hours to build!  Complete kits for for the <a href="http://www.mikrokopter.de/">Microkopters</a> will be available at the workshop.</p>

<p>Do you really have nothing to hide? Prove it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openbeacon.org/ccc-sputnik.0.html">CCC Sputnik</a>, <a href="http://sociopatterns.org">SocioPatterns.org</a>, and the <a href="http://openamd.org/">OpenAMD</a> project from <a href="http://www.2600.com">2600</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thelasthope.org">The Last Hope</a> are teaming up to provide a real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance">mass surveillance</a> experience at the 25C3.

<p>Using RFID technology, congress attendees can elect to participate in a massive human tracking network.  Building on the success of previous efforts with <a href="http://events.ccc.de/2008/01/20/24c3-sputnik-data-available/">Sputnik at 24c3</a>, and at <a href="http://events.ccc.de/camp/2007/Sputnik/index.html">the 2007 CCC camp</a>, this year&#8217;s project will use advanced visualization to allow you to see nearby users, seek out pockets of interests and track who you spent your time with.  There&#8217;s also &#8220;Beacon Royale&#8221;, pitting attendee vs. attendee in virtual combat.</p>
<blockquote><p>Be watched as closely as only tomorrow&#8217;s most sinister politicians can imagine. See how it works - and learn how to circumvent it. Heard about Cory Doctorow&#8217;s Little Brother? Come to the Congress and live the book!</p></blockquote>
