 The next interview in the &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/thought_leader_interviews/"&gt;B2B Marketing thought leader interview series&lt;/a&gt; is with Hunter Boyle, Managing Editor for &lt;a href="http://www.marketingexperimentsblog.com/"&gt;MarketingExperiments&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter’s passion for finding what works and what doesn’t work in optimizing marketing communications has equated to best practices to help marketers generate leads more effectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us a little bit about how you got into &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/"&gt;B2B marketing&lt;/a&gt; and what you like most about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I got into marketing from the creative side, because my background includes writing, design and Web development. The first B2B publisher I worked for was a small company, so while writing my newsletter, I also wrote copy, launched several sites and online marketing projects, and got a crash course in direct mail, sales and integrated marketing. That mix continued throughout my time at the Industry Standard, my work on B2B publications for sales and marketing execs, in communications agencies and consulting projects, right through to today with the MECLABS Group. The ability to work in several different creative roles is still what I enjoy most about marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. As you speak to the value of optimizing Marketing communications, what are your top 3 tips to help B2B marketers generate more qualified leads through optimization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use “friction” to your advantage.&lt;/em&gt; With lead generation, the form can often make or break your efforts. Setting the bar low may increase the volume of requests, but reduce their usefulness. Try testing form variations such as more fields, different information points or questions, breaking a longer form into two parts with an email capture upfront, etc., to find an optimal combination. We’ve achieved triple-digit conversion gains for partners by making this part of the process more effective.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay relevant.&lt;/em&gt; Maintaining relevance from your channels (PPC, SEO, email, etc.) through to your landing pages and website and follow-ups is a must. Our research shows that consistency is a significant factor in the conversion process, so reinforce your messaging at every phase of the marketing and sales funnel. In other words, if your PPC ads promise or promote X, ensure that your landing page, sign-up form, follow-up emails and calls also focus on X.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Segment and target your offers.&lt;/em&gt; Many marketers are still driving traffic to their site’s homepage, or one generic, catch-all landing page. Instead, try a testing approach based on different customer types. For instance, if your customer base includes independent professionals and small businesses, how can you tailor your outreach to each group based on their specific needs and issues? Break out your landing pages, traffic drivers and offers in new ways.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What do you think is the biggest opportunity marketers have in terms of &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/landing-pages.php"&gt;landing page optimization&lt;/a&gt; to increase conversions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Lately we’ve focused a lot on &lt;a href="http://www.marketingexperimentsblog.com/clinic-notes/the-last-word-on-value-propositions-for-now-25-08.php"&gt;using value propositions effectively&lt;/a&gt;. For many sites and businesses, this is a more daunting task than testing copy, graphics, page layouts, etc. But optimizing your value proposition has a greater impact than most page tweaks because it answers the prospect’s biggest question – “Why should I buy from you?” Getting this right is a challenge, but the reward is huge and will have positive repercussions throughout your site and marketing communications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. In your opinion, what is the biggest oversight in effective &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-management.php"&gt;lead management&lt;/a&gt; with respect to how marketing and sales teams work together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Great question. In my experience with sales and marketing, the breakdown usually comes from a lack of communication. I know that sounds touchy-feely, but it’s legitimate. The goals of both departments are ultimately the same – increase revenue – but the collaboration is often out of whack. Our &lt;a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/improving-website-conversion/lead-gen-playbook.html"&gt;recent clinic on lead generation&lt;/a&gt; explored these issues, and one part that really stood out for me was establishing a universal definition of a lead. Having that common definition is one of the best ways to get sales and marketing on the same page. Nail that down and watch what happens to your sales funnel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. With the multitude of promotion channels today (ie: social, blogs, email), what is your advice for B2B marketers striving toward &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/marketing-roi.php"&gt;marketing ROI&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We all know analytics and metrics are vital to marketing. But they don’t tell you everything, including the things you’re not doing. Relying too much on what’s succeeded in the past, or even what’s working now, can hold us back from testing bold moves – and the potential gains and lessons that come from them. Don’t be afraid to fail. With email, SEM, social media, and other channels, test a few curveballs. Whether you end up with a strike, a double or a grand slam, you’ll come away with results and ideas you wouldn’t have gotten by just playing the numbers and sticking too closely to what you’ve always done. Breaking out of the comfort zone can be more difficult than it seems, so try rolling these wild cards into your testing strategy, no matter what the channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wild Card: What question or topic would you like to address?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite MarketingExperiments credos is: people don’t buy from websites; people buy from people. It’s so easy to lose sight of that – especially with the intense pressure to grow revenue in a down economy. We talk about clicks, users, visitors, consumers, prospects and customers, but on the other end of that data is a real person looking to solve a problem or fulfill a need. We need to connect with them in a more transparent, credible manner, regardless of the channel. The rise of social media has made the Web more interpersonal than ever, and in doing so, it’s raised the bar for marketers. I believe the key to success is respecting and engaging your audience and finding ways to interact with and learn from them. Survey them. Pick up the phone. Put yourself in their seat and take a hard look at what is and isn’t working with your marketing efforts. Take their feedback seriously and use it to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/">&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Ken Ross recently wrote on the Expert CEO blog about the &lt;a href="http://blog.expertceo.com/2008/11/30/the-future-of-saas/"&gt;future of&#xD;
Software as a Service in today’s economy&lt;/a&gt;. Although he discusses software in particular, I think his arguments&#xD;
apply to any company that needs to grow without using significant&#xD;
amount of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Historically, SaaS companies needed a significant amount of&#xD;
funding to get to cash flow breakeven. This was because it takes time for the recurring&#xD;
revenues to build up enough to cover the fixed and semi-fixed costs of&#xD;
development, marketing and sales. For example, Ken points out that both salesforce.com&#xD;
and Netsuite took over $100M in venture capital before going public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Today, however, those types of valuations and funding levels&#xD;
are not available, and companies need to find ways to grow their business&#xD;
without using up as much capital. Ken gives a few suggestions for accomplishing&#xD;
this goal, including building up services revenue and getting payments up front&#xD;
where possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Perhaps mostly important, Ken writes that capital-efficient growth&#xD;
can only come from streamlined customer acquisition processes that takes&#xD;
advantage of the latest internet-era tools, such as salesforce.com; WebEx, GoToMeeting,&#xD;
or ReadyTalk; and Marketo. Together, tools like these create an ecosystem for capital-efficient&#xD;
growth: CRM to manage accounts, contacts, and opportunities; online meetings to&#xD;
improve productivity and reduce travel cost; and &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-management.php"&gt;lead&#xD;
management&lt;/a&gt; to create a steady stream of qualified sales leads and to help the&#xD;
sales team prioritize their time onto the best leads and opportunities. The&#xD;
result of this infrastructure is a streamlined &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2008/07/the-revenue-cyc.html"&gt;revenue cycle&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
that can drive 40% better sales effectiveness (or more), allowing each sales rep&#xD;
to carry higher quota and to drive more revenue at the same fixed cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At Marketo, we use these tools to drive our own high-volume revenue&#xD;
cycle, so I know it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, one trap that companies run into is investing in &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/marketing-automation.php"&gt;marketing&#xD;
automation&lt;/a&gt; that is not as fast, nimble or flexible as tools like salesforce.com&#xD;
or WebEx. Even if delivered over the web, these older marketing automation&#xD;
tools are still from the old era of expensive and rigid enterprise software. As&#xD;
a result, they tend to force you to do things “The Hard Way”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;To truly accomplish streamlined customer acquisition, your&#xD;
marketing automation tool needs to let you work “The Easy Way”, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;li&gt;Up and running fast, without significant costs for integration to CRM&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;li&gt;Easy to learn and use without needing to hire specialists or to pay for training courses&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;li&gt;Flexibile to let you adapt marketing programs to changing market conditions&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At Marketo, we’ve recently published &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/library/big-easy-guidebook.pdf"&gt;The Big Easy&#xD;
Guidebook to Marketing Automation&lt;/a&gt; to help our prospects understand some of&#xD;
the differences between “The Hard Way” and “The Easy Way”. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/.a/6a00d83451b45369e201053610afe1970b-pi" style="float: right;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Klein" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b45369e201053610afe1970b " src="http://blog.marketo.com/.a/6a00d83451b45369e201053610afe1970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Mark Klein"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
 The next interview in the &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/thought_leader_interviews/"&gt;B2B Marketing thought leader interview series&lt;/a&gt; is with Mark Klein, CEO of predictive analytics company Loyalty Builders. Like me, Mark is a direct marketing expert whose background in science and passion for mathematics equates into a desire to help marketers improve their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us a little bit about how you got into mathematical marketing, and what you like most about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I was working for IBM, who had purchased my third company, when they initiated a compensation plan for senior management based on the company’s customer satisfaction scores. That wasn’t working well for me, for a couple of reasons. First, there was no granularity of person: good performers were compensated equally with poor performers. Secondly, customer satisfaction is a backwards-looking measure, and gave me no help in managing my small slice of that very big business. I left IBM to work on a better measure, and soon abandoned customer satisfaction in favor of &lt;a href="http://www.longbowdirectmarketing.com/resources/white-papers/the-mathematics-of-customer-loyalty"&gt;customer loyalty&lt;/a&gt;, which was much more predictive. After a bit of work, I developed a model of customer future behavior based on past purchases, and most of what we do in &lt;a href="http://www.longbowdirectmarketing.com/resources/help-center/mathematical-marketing"&gt;Mathematical Marketing&lt;/a&gt; followed along. Earlier in life I spent several years as a theoretical physicist, so I was very comfortable using mathematics to predict the future. It’s been a lot of fun showing companies that they are sitting on a lot of data that can really boost their marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You are a frequent contributor to the Longbow Direct Marketing blog, speaking to the value of using mathematics to help B2B marketers improve their campaigns, what are your top three tips in terms of how marketers can better leverage mathematics to help drive a &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/marketing-roi.php"&gt;marketing ROI&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;You threw me an easy pitch over the middle of the plate. Our mantra around here is Track, Target, and Test. Tip #1 is collect, guard, and use your customer transaction data. It’s the basis of Mathematical Marketing. Tip #2 is to segment and target customers based not on firmographics but on the much more accurate, and more predictive, transaction data. Tip #3 is to constantly &lt;a href="http://www.longbowdirectmarketing.com/resources/help-center/testing-primer"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;, both offers and targeting. Testing is probably the fastest and easiest way to jumpstart your marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What do you think is the biggest opportunity marketers have in terms of more effective &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/lead-generation-software.php"&gt;lead generation&lt;/a&gt;? Specifically, in regards to how the marketing and sales teams work together? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Lead generation, like most existing customer marketing, is still too qualitative. Typically leads are cold, warm, or hot. Too few companies even know the cost of a lead, and if their leads come from multiple channels, for example trade shows and internet, they may not even know which channel is more cost effective. The same mathematical discipline we practice in existing customer marketing should carry over to acquisition. Further, Mathematical Marketing shines in creating lists for the sales team of customers and the products each customer is likely to buy. Sales people love those lists (they deliver fatter commissions), and that love extends to the marketing team that delivered the leads, fostering a good cooperation between the departments. Finally, there is lots of room to model responses to promotion, to carry personas developed in Mathematical Marketing over to customer acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. In the B2B market, what do you see as the biggest hurdle to effective &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/lead-management-software.php"&gt;lead management&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;While some marketers embrace quantitative methodology, a lot more avoid it. A good part of the industry needs an Attitude Adjustment Hour. People unwilling to change are the hurdle to be overcome. Our experience is that this problem fixes itself once some parts of the organization begin to use Mathematical Marketing. Typically their results are such a big improvement over what they produced using their older methodology that others want to jump on the same train, out of fear of being left in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wild Card: Anything else you would like to add?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Will someone explain to me why most companies get the overwhelming share of their revenue from existing customers, yet allocate the overwhelming share of their marketing budget to customer acquisition? We’re seeing some shift, and the catch phrase is “&lt;a href="http://www.longbowdirectmarketing.com/blog/retention-is-the-new-acquisition"&gt;retention is the new acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.” But marketing spend ratios are still badly out of whack. Today, there are some forces driving a different perspective. First, our shrinking global economy is making many companies look more closely at the revenue from their existing customers. Second, the wider availability of tools that don’t require statisticians on staff is accelerating this trend. I have an optimistic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/">&lt;p&gt;Now that we are officially in a recession (at least in &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-03-04-local-differences_N.htm"&gt;most states&lt;/a&gt;), it seems like more and more marketers are looking for tips and ideas about how to adjust their practices given the macro-economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two months, the number one post on my blog has been "&lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2008/06/7-strategies-fo.html"&gt;7 Strategies for B2B Marketing during a Recession: The Definitive Guide&lt;/a&gt;".  Originally published in June, what's really dramatic is how quickly it's ramped up since September when the crisis really took hold. Take a look at the Google Analytics report:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marketing in a recession" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b45369e2010535f676b5970c image-full " src="http://blog.marketo.com/.a/6a00d83451b45369e2010535f676b5970c-800wi" title="Marketing in a recession"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, that's a 1,300% increase in searches, clicks, and page views on that topic in just seven weeks, and yet another way, each and every day more than 35 people are typing "marketing in a recession" into Google and clicking through to read that blog post.  (And, when they get there, they are really spending time reading it, spending almost four and half minutes on average on the page.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does all this mean? It means that now, more than ever, marketers need to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Maximize conversion of their advertising dollars into prospects by optimizing their &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/landing-pages.php"&gt;landing pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Stop wasting leads that aren't yet sales ready and start using &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-nurturing.php"&gt;lead nurturing&lt;/a&gt; to build relationships so that when they are ready to buy, you'll be positioned to win. In a recession, new prospects are less likely to be looking to purchase right away — which means they are less likely to want to talk to a sales rep. Lead nurturing is even more critical in a recession to ensure you convert the precious dollars you spend acquiring prospects into revenue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-scoring.php"&gt;lead scoring&lt;/a&gt; to identify the best leads and help the sales team prioritize where they spend their time&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Prove the impact their marketing activities have on revenue and pipeline&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any additional tips for &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2008/06/7-strategies-fo.html"&gt;marketing in a recession&lt;/a&gt; If so, please share!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/">&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is an amazing amount of great content about B2B&#xD;
marketing out there, ranging from trends in demand generation&#xD;
to best practices in lead nurturing, lead scoring, and landing page&#xD;
optimization to how to buy and select &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/marketing-automation.php" title="marketing automation software"&gt;marketing automation&lt;/a&gt; systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;To help you find the good stuff, we recently put together a new&#xD;
site with &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/"&gt;B2B&#xD;
marketing tools and resources&lt;/a&gt; that collects a whopping 64 eBooks, whitepapers,&#xD;
webinars, podcasts and blog posts to help you learn all these best practices&#xD;
and more. Many of these are authored by the team at Marketo, but certainly not&#xD;
all of them. As always, if you have an additional tool or resource you'd like&#xD;
to share, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;h2&gt;Seven &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-nurturing.php"&gt;Lead Nurturing Tools and Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Lead nurturing is the process of building relationships with&#xD;
qualified prospects regardless of their timing to buy. Over 50% of leads are&#xD;
not yet sales ready, so nurturing those leads rather than throwing them away can&#xD;
help you maximize results. These blog posts, whitepapers, and podcasts can show&#xD;
you how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;By tracking your prospect's behaviors and web&#xD;
activity, you can determine their level of interest in your solution&#xD;
(engagement) in addition to your interest in them (demographics targeting).&#xD;
Only by combining both factors can you send truly qualified leads to sales. Download&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Demand generation is the evolution of traditional lead&#xD;
generation. Unlike traditional programs that throw any lead over the wall to&#xD;
sales, demand generation is about qualifying and prioritizing prospects,&#xD;
nurturing a steady crop of qualified leads that want to engage with sales,&#xD;
coordinating ongoing activities with sales, and measuring and optimizing the&#xD;
results over time. These tools and resources will help you research demand&#xD;
generation and learn the latest best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

 1. Tell us a little bit about how you got into &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/index.php" title="b2b marketing from marketo"&gt;B2B marketing&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
and what you like most about it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I originally started my career in direct marketing where I worked&#xD;
with some of the largest B2B and B2C companies in the world. To&#xD;
give you some context, I began my career with the feeling that&#xD;
B2B was "behind the times". The B2C marketplace (as it related to&#xD;
marketing) always fascinated me due to how you could truly craft a&#xD;
message to the "individual" vs. the group and track so many&#xD;
different variables to consistently improve results and create&#xD;
"predictable" ROI. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But over the last 7-10 years, B2B has really evolved to practice&#xD;
many of the same principals B2C has been practicing for quite&#xD;
some time, and now, with the introduction of technology (like&#xD;
&lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/" title="marketing automation"&gt;Marketo&lt;/a&gt;) the gap is really closing between the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now believe that B2B and B2C are not that different. Whether&#xD;
you are building a brand, managing direct marketing or driving&#xD;
leads for a large technology firm's sales team, you must understand:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics and demonstrating marketing's value&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The core objectives of what you&#xD;
are trying to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;How creative and messaging works&#xD;
together&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
I've always been a sales person first and a marketer second,&#xD;
so as B2B continues to evolve it is exciting for me to focus on&#xD;
this area. The dynamics of how marketing and sales should&#xD;
work together is something I am very passionate about.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. From reading your blog, I see that you write a lot&#xD;
about B2B marketing innovation. What are your top 3 tips to help&#xD;
companies tackle the art of innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an open mind and &lt;em&gt;don't let people in your organization&#xD;
say you can't do something. &lt;/em&gt; If you hear this, it probably&#xD;
means it hasn't been tried before or that the benefits of what&#xD;
you are trying to accomplish were not positioned&#xD;
properly. If you have a new idea, go for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Never stop learning! Marketing is changing faster&#xD;
than marketing departments (or executives) can keep up with. Take time out of your schedule to read the research&#xD;
reports and articles, go to some of the better conferences and&#xD;
most importantly, make sure you get the same commitment from&#xD;
your marketing teams. It does no good to educate yourself&#xD;
if you are not demanding the same of your team. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Learn and adopt new marketing technologies. What&#xD;
current marketing technology tools enable you to do is truly&#xD;
awesome and they bring a level of capability never before seen&#xD;
in the B2B space. If you want to be perceived as&#xD;
innovative, you must understand the importance of technology&#xD;
and embrace it. Don't get caught up in trying to do&#xD;
everything, just roll the technology out in phases and create&#xD;
value little by little. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A recent post on your blog speaks to &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/sales-marketing-alignment.php" title="align marketing and sales"&gt;sales and&#xD;
marketing alignment&lt;/a&gt;. What advice do you have for marketers and&#xD;
sales professionals as they develop integrated &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/demand-generation.php" title="demand generation"&gt;demand generation&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
campaigns?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have three key pieces of advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Buying Process. Study your customers buying&#xD;
process and make sure both sales and marketing understand the&#xD;
integration between the "sales process" and the "customer's"&#xD;
buying process. It's unrealistic to expect marketing and&#xD;
sales to only communicate in certain phases of the buying&#xD;
process. It is imperative that each function know the type of&#xD;
communication that is happening during each phase of the revenue cycle. See &lt;a href="http://b2bmarketingevolved.%20blogspot.%20com/2008/02/5-keys-to-lead-nurturing-1-customer.%20html"&gt;The 5 Keys to Lead Nurturing - #1 Customer Buying Process&lt;/a&gt; for more detail. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-nurturing.php" title="lead nurturing"&gt;Lead Nurturing&lt;/a&gt;. Understand that all your marketing&#xD;
and sales initiatives should complement each other.&#xD;
Dialogue with customers and prospects should be about sales and&#xD;
marketing providing the right content to the right people at the right time, and not&#xD;
one or the other controlling the conversation. This mindset change is one of the biggest&#xD;
transformations I see when working with sales and&#xD;
marketing executives in the technology space. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Consider your data to be one of your most important assets. We often recommend to clients, prior to starting a demand generation campaign, that they first clean their data, develop a data hygiene plan, and consider adding or appending information to records that can help drive better campaign results. Appended data may enable greater degrees of segmentation permitting sharper focus in the campaign messaging. A related benefit of &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/marketing-automation.php"&gt;marketing automation&lt;/a&gt; platforms is the personalization of messages to each prospect versus sending the same content to everyone. This personalization can be done based on behavioral and demographic data.&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you see as the biggest hurdle to&#xD;
effective &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/lead-management.php" title="lead management best practices"&gt;lead management&lt;/a&gt; within the sales pipeline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Making sales understand the importance of their role in the lead&#xD;
management process. They are not accustomed (or&#xD;
compensated) to keep good data or contribute to this&#xD;
process. You must make them understand why it will help&#xD;
them, but it is still never an easy thing to do and is one of the&#xD;
challenges we run into quite frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. What do you think is the biggest oversight by&#xD;
marketers in terms of &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/demand-generation.php" title="demand generation best practices"&gt;demand generation&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;It's almost always analytics. Sometimes because they don't&#xD;
know how, but other times because it is just too time consuming to&#xD;
aggregate data from all of the different places in order to get&#xD;
dependable, accurate information. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. With the multitude of promotion channels today (ie:&#xD;
social, blogs, email), what is your advice for B2B marketers&#xD;
striving toward &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-resources/marketing-roi.php" title="marketing ROI and acccountability"&gt;marketing ROI&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and evaluate your marketing department from a&#xD;
people, process and technology standpoint. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Develop benchmarks of success. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a solid lead management process in place&#xD;
first - it really won't matter what tactic you are using if&#xD;
this is not done correctly. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Examine each of your marketing campaigns on the basis of what their objectives are: Awareness, lead generation, lead nurturing, loyalty marketing, sales tools development&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Draw from your web analytics, marketing automation analytics AND sales force analytics to develop dashboards that can provide the kind of information necessary to truly measure the sales and marketing departments effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Wild Card: Anything else you'd like to&#xD;
add?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extremely exciting to see how far B2B&#xD;
has come over the past five to ten years. The idea that we&#xD;
would be able to profile customers based on online and offline&#xD;
behavior, map content and campaigns directly to the individual&#xD;
based on where they are in the buying process&#xD;
would have been something reserved&#xD;
for only the most savvy consumer marketing companies 20 years&#xD;
ago. Technology, along with a shift to marketing&#xD;
accountability, brings marketing executives an incredible&#xD;
opportunity to begin to show their organization's value at a level&#xD;
they never have been able to before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

In this on-demand webinar, “&lt;a href="http://pages2.marketo.com/idc-webinar.html?comment=idc%20webinar&amp;amp;source=Blog&amp;amp;offer=idc%20webinar"&gt;Trends, Forecasts,&#xD;

Available now &lt;a href="http://pages2.marketo.com/idc-webinar.html?comment=idc%20webinar&amp;amp;source=Blog&amp;amp;offer=idc%20webinar"&gt;on-demand&lt;/a&gt;, Michael discusses the&#xD;
following topics:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The marketing organization of the future (slides 5-7)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Best practices for centralizing or de-centralizing your&#xD;
marketing department (slides 8-10)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Making marketing more relevant through sales enablement&#xD;
(slides 11-15)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;On slides 16-26, Michael also gives key benchmarks that are&#xD;
essential to help you plan your &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/marketing_budgets/"&gt;B2B marketing budget&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. (In&#xD;
one of my first posts, I reported on the same &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2006/10/benchmarking_ma.html"&gt;marketing budget&#xD;
benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; for 2006.) For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Investment Trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing Budget Ratio (marketing spend/revenue):&#xD;
2.8% average (2.6% for hardware, 5.1% for software, 0.8% for&#xD;
services)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;A-D (awareness spend as % of total awareness + demand):&#xD;
49%&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Staff Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Program-to-People Ratio (program spend as a % of total&#xD;
mktg. spend): 61%&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing Staff Throughput Ratio (program spend per staff):&#xD;
$293,000&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Processes and Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing Operations KPI (MO staff per total mktg. staff):&#xD;
5.2%&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing Automation KPI (spend on marketing applications&#xD;
software as a percent of total marketing investment): 1.9%&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 23 shows how companies allocate their program budgets&#xD;
across events, advertising, direct marketing, marketing support&#xD;
and sales tools, digital marketing, etc; slide 24 shows how staff&#xD;
is allocated across functions, and slide 25 shows how companies&#xD;
are allocating their digital marketing budgets across&#xD;
advertising, search, email, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
Note that these benchmarks are for large IT companies with&#xD;
average revenue of $6 billion a year, so smaller companies and&#xD;
different industries will have different ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

The next interview in the &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/thought_leader_interviews/"&gt;B2B
 Marketing thought leader interview series&lt;/a&gt; is with &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/craigrosenberg"&gt;Craig Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="http://www.funnelholic.com/"&gt;The Funnelholic&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite B2B marketing blogs). Craig is Vice President, Products and Services at &lt;a href="http://www.tippit.com/"&gt;Tippit, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the world's fastest growing B2B online media and
lead generation company. You can also follow him on Twitter (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/funnelholic"&gt;funnelholic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us a little bit about how you got into &lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/"&gt;B2B
marketing&lt;/a&gt; and what you like most about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think any of us planned to be in B2B when we were
thinking about our careers, so like many of us, I fell into it.
In kindergarten, kids are invariably asked what they want to be
when they grow up. I still have the picture of a young Dr.
Rosenberg, following in his father's footsteps. My mom
tells me that the class had 50 percent teachers, 20 percent
doctors, and a handful of firemen and policemen. No B2B
marketers. And when you leave college, you don't say
&amp;quot;I am going to be the best B2B marketer in the software
industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent my early career in the sales side of the business, and
really cut my B2B marketing teeth in the years I worked at
SalesRamp LLC, working for Stu Silverman. We were a boutique
sales and marketing firm that consulted with technology companies
about their lead-generation strategy and inside sales processes.
I had invaluable access to a variety of sales and marketing
organizations and their tactics. My experiences helped solidify
my marketing ideology and clarify my belief system. At that
point, I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B2B marketing is my passion because it's strategic,
always changing, and always broken. I can talk all day about
anything (ask anyone who knows me about this), but my real
expertise is the &amp;quot;top of the funnel&amp;quot; — that is,
outbound marketing, lead generation, lead development, and inside
sales. I can talk a mean game about B2B sales as well. All of it
gets my blood flowing. I actually love writing my blog, &lt;a href="http://www.funnelholic.com/"&gt;The
Funnelholic&lt;/a&gt;. It's my b2b
&amp;quot;top of the funnel&amp;quot; labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. From reading your blog, I see that you write a lot about &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/lead-management-software.php"&gt;lead
management&lt;/a&gt; and lead generation, what are your top 3 tips to help
companies develop integrated campaigns to generate more high-quality sales leads?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great question. Here are my three tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No matter what you do, don't pass leads directly to
the sales team&lt;/em&gt;: You can run the best integrated campaign, but
you will fail if you have not built a lead-qualification
process that includes both a crack lead-qualification team and
a marketing automation program. Cultivate and qualify leads so
that your sales team is working sales-ready opportunities and,
as a result, loves you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow the metrics&lt;/em&gt;: Make sure they are the right ones:
While ROI is the end game, it can't drive your every move
when you're developing your campaign. Early on you should
be focused on impression-to-registration conversion rates (for
landing pages) and leads-to-sales opportunities. ROI needs to
be realized over a longer period of time. (Prepare to give it a
year — or more in some cases — especially when you
are leveraging marketing automation.) Follow the metrics you
can control and optimize against. Marketing ensures shots at
the plate; sales racks up the RBIs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test and optimize&lt;/em&gt;: You are doing yourself a tremendous
disservice if you expect to hit your campaign ball out of the
park immediately. Prepare to optimize the program as it
progresses. A/B test your landing pages and creative.
Don't underestimate something as simple as changing the
font size on a reg form and seeing higher conversion rates.
Work with publishers who are syndicating your white papers on
their sites. Test 100 leads, but during the process,
don't simply shrug and say &amp;quot;these leads
aren't working.&amp;quot; Say &amp;quot;how can we optimize
this program&amp;quot;? Work with the publishers. Watch white
paper syndication programs improve as you collectively optimize
each of your sites. Whatever your campaign is, allow
yourself the ability to make it better as it progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A recent post on your blog discusses &lt;a href="http://www.funnelholic.com/2008/09/25/3-changes-marketers-must-make-to-survive-in-this-post-apocalyptic-world/"&gt;3 changes
marketers must make to survive our current economic situation&lt;/a&gt;.
What advice do you have for those marketers who choose to step
out of the box and redefine their target market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already seeing organizations redefine their target
markets. Over the past couple years, large customers in the
technology industry have focused on what they consider emerging
markets: global and SMBs. Now, they are heading home to their
enterprise comfort zones as SMBs are gearing up to get hit the
hardest without access to capital and global markets, which were
already complex, becoming more difficult to solve with the global
recession. Vendors focused on financial service organizations are
not only re-targeting and re-messaging, but are re-productizing
to move away from those markets they had recently been wooing
with vigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to do a couple of things. I'll break it up into
&amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;push.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Pull&amp;quot; is
defined as leads that are generated via your Web site, paid
search, white paper syndication, and so on. These leads are
walking into your store. &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; is defined as
people you target and specifically focus your outbound marketing
campaigns efforts on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What tips fo you have for optimizing your &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; marketing tactics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most pundits are going to tell you to focus on specific targets for your
&amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; activities, like telling publishers you want
only certain companies or industries. I don't agree. There
is actually no better gauge of interest than the Internet, so if
you can afford it, don't apply too many filters. In the
coming years, we will all struggle to find buyers, so keep the
door open — so to speak — to find buyers you
hadn't thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generate leads and then watch the data. What types of leads
are converting into sales opportunities? Break them down by
industry, size, job function, and so on to define your target
markets. For example, I was consulting for a company post-2001
whose product manager had done a great job researching and making
a compelling case for targeting Tier-1 manufacturers. He created
a profile outlining their pains, needs, and objectives. Our basic
lead generation campaign was outbound to this narrowly defined
target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a little company called Yahoo downloaded their the
company's white paper. Our lead qualification rep contacted the lead
and identified interest, yet no one in sales wanted to follow up.
Eventually, we convinced our product manager to call the
prospect. He realized there was an opportunity, they closed the
deal, and their target market expanded into the Internet. By the
way, they never ended up selling anything to manufacturers
— but they did build a real Internet business and got
bought last year. The moral of the story is that targeting is
key, but don't ignore the people who raise their hand and,
as importantly, allow them the chance to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. What about &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; I make the opposite argument. Know what
you're getting yourself into. Research. Do some financial
analysis to look for companies that not only have the
wherewithal, but are more likely to see your solution as a
&amp;quot;need to have.&amp;quot; I suggest any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hire a research firm&lt;/em&gt;: You don't need to pay Gartner
to do this. There are plenty of smart research analysts
out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get appointments with these targets&lt;/em&gt;: If you have the
infrastructure, set up 5 to 10 meetings with prospects who may
fit into your target market. If you don't have the
bandwidth, hire a pay-for-performance appointment-setting
group. And when you talk to your prospects, have a range of
people involved in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as you can see from the &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; example
— now, no doubt, part of that company's lore
—find out if there are any prospects to target. Don't
ignore hand-raisers. And get feedback from sales about creating
new target segments. If you do only research, you will have to
make some relatively blind bets. If you follow the pull paradigm,
you have actual internal data, and you're not making a
blind bet. Add them to your target market and push out to
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Given that you speak to lead
management, what do you see as the biggest hurdle to managing
leads effectively?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest hurdle today is not having an internal
infrastructure built to process and qualify leads. Marketing
departments think in terms of campaigns they are running, yet
many never achieve their goals. Without a solid
lead qualification /lead management system in place, you won't be a
marketing machine. You need to build the infrastructure that produces sales-ready leads.
To me, this infrastructure includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lead qualification group&lt;/em&gt;: Have a team whose job it is to
reach leads and qualify them. The simple act of reaching leads
makes a group such as this worth their freight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead qualification process&lt;/em&gt;: You can't just hire people.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unify sales-ready lead definitions&lt;/em&gt;: Agree with sales on
expectations. Lead definition has to be agreed on for this to
work. If you don't, expect yourselves — excuse the
allusion — to live on Mars and sales to continue to live
on Venus. Without common agreed-on deliverables, you will not
succeed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketing automation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Marketing automation is one of the
greatest inventions of the last 20 years for the
lead-generation process. Use marketing automation to connect
faster and more efficiently, understand your campaign's
lead generation effectiveness, and leverage drip marketing /nurture
marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; What do you think is the biggest
oversight by marketers in terms of &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/lead-generation-software.php"&gt;lead generation?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not questioning everything, all the time. Process, metrics,
testing, strategy, relationships, and so on. While it might sound
callous to treat people as commodities, surround yourself with
the best and the brightest. Question talent and question
partnerships. But don't walk away too quickly, marketing
and lead generation is an optimization process and if you are
properly analyzing, challenging, and then re-testing, your
success will increase. But nothing will be &amp;quot;always
on,&amp;quot; where you can turn on the lead generation spigot and
walk away. Work at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; With the multitude of promotion
channels today (ie: social, blogs, email), what is your advice
for B2B marketers striving toward &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/marketing-roi.php"&gt;marketing ROI&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test. What works for some, doesn't work for others. But
I have seen them all work in certain scenerios. And set
reasonable expectations. Here is my opinion on a few promotional
channels out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blogging&lt;/em&gt;: I wrote about this in a post &lt;a href="http://www.funnelholic.com/2008/08/19/does-this-blogging-stuff-even-work/"&gt;Does Blogging Even
Work?&lt;/a&gt; Well, it does work, but I don't view it as a
lead generation vehicle. But it's a good
thought leadership vehicle. The most unique selling proposition
you have is yourself, and blogging has given us marketers the
ability to look smart and create a personality behind the brand
— something not available before. My vote? Do it.
It's not a must-do but if you have the time, add it to
the list.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email&lt;/em&gt;: Does email work? I love email. I especially like it
from a drip marketing/nurture perspective. Nurturing leads is
one of the biggest innovations in marketing, and it has brought
email science back up to the top. You should be sending
&lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/email-marketing-software.php"&gt;targeted emails&lt;/a&gt; against your nurture campaigns one to two times
a month, with a marketing automation solution telling you who,
when and what. My vote? Do this a lot. Marketers use this to
get ROI back on lead generation campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;White paper syndication&lt;/em&gt;: Does this work? Yes, but you have
to be ready to nurture/cultivate these leads over time. The
beauty of white paper-syndication campaigns is the
pay-for-performance aspect. I don't love campaigns that
cost money, but you don't really know what you are going
to get. Work with a partner to pepper the Internet with your
white papers. My vote? Do it, and don't stop. This is a
quantifiable way to create predictable lead flow into your lead
-generation process. Once you've created the white paper,
let the publishers do the work for you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webinars&lt;/em&gt;: Thought leadership, branding, quantifiable lead
generation, and education combined in a medium that more and
more prospects are getting used to using. We just did a study
on CRM buyers in the &amp;quot;considered purchase&amp;quot;
category, and they go to 3 to 4 webinars a month. Either way,
the very basis of drip marketing is to touch the prospect with
a variety of media until that hand raises again. My vote? Do
it. Use a partner to help you produce and promote them, but
produce webinars at least once a month.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt;: To early to call. I need to see more data on this.
I encourage someone to prove me otherwise, but I am not sure
the power of the podcast is mature yet. My vote? Unsure.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paid Search&lt;/em&gt;: You have to do paid search. Your competitors
are. My vote: Do it. If you can't compete effectively,
outsource it to someone who can.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;SEO&lt;/em&gt;: This is tricky, because it is very important. I am in
the third-party lead business, and I can safely say there is
typically no better lead than the lead who goes to your Web
site, fills out a form, and asks for your sales rep to call.
But SEO is complicated. Make sure you educate yourself on how
you are going to attack SEO and do it right, or you'll
just spin your tires. My vote: Do it, but have a plan and
realize it takes time. If necessary, hire a consultant.
It's that important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much out there, and technology is changing
quickly, and there are always new tactics. Keep an eye on your
competitors and test as much as you can. Then you can call
yourself a true lead generation person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://blog.marketo.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/04/spencerkollas.jpg" title="Spencerkollas" alt="Spencerkollas" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&#xD;
As a follow-up to my post about the&#xD;
&lt;a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2008/10/b2b-email-deliv.html"&gt;importance of reputation in email marketing&lt;/a&gt;,&#xD;
I interviewed Spencer Kollas, director of delivery services at &lt;a href="http://www.strongmail.com/"&gt;StrongMail&lt;/a&gt;,&#xD;
about the latest technology solutions to manage reputation and optimize deliverability. (Disclosure: Marketo uses&#xD;
StrongMail technology, and the techniques described below, to optimize our email services for deliverability.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do most &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/"&gt;marketing automation&lt;/a&gt; and CRM solutions fail when it comes to deliverability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, there are two components to deliverability. The first responsibility is on the&#xD;
solution provider for providing the right tools for engaging in email best practices. The second&#xD;
is on the end-user for following through with them. Having the ability to automatically&#xD;
throttle email based on ISP requirements is one core technology feature that facilitates&#xD;
deliverability, as is support for email authentication, smart bounce management and real-time&#xD;
reporting to address any challenges as they arise. Without these capabilities, the end-users of&#xD;
these solutions are unable to keep their lists clean or manage their email sending speed — both&#xD;
of which can get them blocked by ISPs. With email sender reputation being the most critical&#xD;
factor affecting deliverability, marketing automation and CRM solutions need to empower their&#xD;
end-users with the capabilities mentioned above — and not all of them do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain the role of emerging authentication protocols such as DomainKeys (aka DKIM: DomainKeys Identified Mail), SPF, and Sender-ID?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;These help to authenticate your messages with ISPs, letting them know your emails come from&#xD;
you and are not phishing or spoofing attempts. This can in turn improve deliverability&#xD;
since various ISPs use them as ways to filter mail coming&#xD;
into their systems. Many of the larger ISPs use one or multiple authentication methods to help&#xD;
their systems build a reputation for each sender. StrongMail continues to be at the forefront of&#xD;
these technologies, because we support all the key technologies, as well as understand and&#xD;
believe in the important role that they play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is proper bounce handling important, and how does StrongMail technology automate&#xD;
the process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Proper bounce management is critical for enabling good email practices and increased&#xD;
deliverability. Unless a marketer knows why their emails are bouncing and why, they can't&#xD;
effectively keep their lists clean, address deliverability issues as they arise, and promptly&#xD;
process unsubscribes. StrongMail has the most sophisticated bounce management technology in the&#xD;
industry, providing granular visibility into delivery rates. StrongMail's Smart Bounce Management&#xD;
technology automatically captures both synchronous and asynchronous bounces, processes&#xD;
unsubscribes, applies hundreds of rules to normalize data across thousands of ISPs, presents the&#xD;
consolidated information into logical categories, and offers tips for correcting the issue that&#xD;
caused the bounce in the first place. (Note: Marketo uses this information to automatically process bounces&#xD;
for customers.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other list scrubbing techniques are important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to maintaining proper bounce processing, you should also sign up for all available&#xD;
&lt;a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com//content//20596.asp"&gt;feedback loops&lt;/a&gt; to help ensure that your list is as clean as possible, and that you're only sending&#xD;
email to those clients that wish to receive your messages. And remember that list scrubbing&#xD;
should go beyond removing distribution accounts (e.g. sales@ and info@) and inactive and&#xD;
duplicate addresses — you should also be running your list against a list of known bad&#xD;
domains and role accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/">&lt;p&gt;B2B marketers struggling for growth in today's economy know they need to&#xD;
get maximum results for their email marketing efforts, but too many do not understand the critical role deliverability&#xD;
plays in the process of turning prospects into revenue-driving&#xD;
customers. All the creativity and planning that goes into a &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/email-marketing-software.php"&gt;targeted email marketing&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
campaign is meaningless if your emails don't reach their intended&#xD;
inboxes. Every undelivered email is a lost lead, and the money you spent to acquire that lead gets wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, email deliverability is critical to the success of your &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/lead-management-software.php"&gt;lead management&lt;/a&gt; programs. The world of email deliverability has changed quite a bit in the last few years. It's no longer good enough just to avoid certain words in your copy. The technology used by your email service provider can play a big role in optimizing delivery, and the most important factor today is your email sending reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

To learn more about email reputation, I posed the following questions to George Bilbrey, president of &lt;a href="http://www.returnpath.net/"&gt;Return Path&lt;/a&gt;, the world's leading email services company. (Disclosure: &lt;a href="http://www.marketo.com/b2b-marketing-software/email-marketing-software.php"&gt;Marketo&lt;/a&gt; uses Return Path's technology to monitor and manage our own reputation as well as that of our clients.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the current state of deliverability for commercial&#xD;
 email senders in the B2B space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;About 1 in 5 commercial emails&#xD;
 do not make it into the inbox. Among our clients, that&#xD;
 ranges from below 50% to close to 100%. The difference&#xD;
 between the best delivery rates and the worst are the reputation&#xD;
 of the sending mail server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the economic impact of poor email deliverability?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In the&#xD;
 simplest terms, whatever you hope to gain from your email&#xD;
 marketing efforts (brand recognition, increased sales, client&#xD;
 retention) is reduced by whatever percentage of email&#xD;
 doesn’t make it to the inbox. But the impact can be&#xD;
 worse. Imagine your salesperson has a great call with a&#xD;
 prospect and then promises to send follow-up information by&#xD;
 email. That email gets junked or blocked. Now the&#xD;
 prospect thinks your salesperson is a flake. Or the client&#xD;
 who thinks their account rep never returns email because it gets&#xD;
 caught in their spam filter. Scenarios like these happen&#xD;
 every day to businesses across the country and around the&#xD;
 globe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best way to maximize your email deliverability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;In one word: reputation. More than 80 percent of delivery problems today are caused by the sender’s email reputation. Senders with a good reputation get&#xD;
 delivered. Senders with a poor reputation don’t. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the key elements to ensuring a good reputation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;First and foremost, keep your complaint rate low. If&#xD;
 recipients mark your messages as spam that is going to lower your&#xD;
 reputation substantially. Also, keep spam traps off your&#xD;
 list. Our Reputation Benchmark Report found that servers&#xD;
 that send to just one spam trap had deliverability rates 20&#xD;
 points lower than servers that don’t hit traps. We&#xD;
 found the same for servers that have high unknown user rates, so&#xD;
 keep your file clean. And definitely watch&#xD;
 blacklists. We have found that even blacklists that&#xD;
 aren’t used by ISPs or other receivers are important to&#xD;
 monitor — not because they &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; blocking but because&#xD;
 they predict it. Permission is important, too, but&#xD;
 it’s not a simple linear relationship (e.g., confirmed&#xD;
 opt-in doesn’t automatically confer a good&#xD;
 reputation). Permission influences complaints. Email&#xD;
 recipients complain about email they don’t recognize.&#xD;
 So, a confirmed opt-in process can be helpful, since recipients&#xD;
 are less likely to mis-remember opting to receive your&#xD;
 messages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can a company manage and improve its reputation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;p&gt;Knowing what your reputation is today is the first step. We&#xD;
 have set up a site where any sender can find out their Sender&#xD;
 Score: &lt;a href="http://www.senderscore.org"&gt;www.senderscore.org&lt;/a&gt;. Your Sender Score is a number between&#xD;
 1 (bad) and 100 (good) that is a representation of your&#xD;
 reputation based on the factors that ISPs and other large-volume&#xD;
 receivers consider important. It works similar to a credit&#xD;
 score. Having a high Sender Score doesn’t guarantee&#xD;
 inbox delivery, but it strongly correlates to good&#xD;
 deliverability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
