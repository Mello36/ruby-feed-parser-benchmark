			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The topic I wanted to write about today (the audition process) required some online research but due to a nearly 24 hour internet service outage in my area of Chicago, that wasn&#8217;t an option. As such, I&#8217;ll have to address that topic toward the middle of next week after I return from some work in Seattle. In an odd sort of silver lining, my interaction with a Comcast customer service manager reminded me that it is still not okay to chew gum while talking to a customer. As a quick reminder, if you haven&#8217;t weighed in on this cycle of the Cultural Confidence poll, <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/?page_id=2276">do so today</a> as I&#8217;ll be tallying the results for this cycle over the weekend.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Virginia Symphony Orchestra (VSO) awaits a December 17, 2008 decision by their local government over whether or not they will provide emergency financial support in the form of a loan, supporters of the program, such as City of Norfolk Mayor Paul D. Fraim, can draw support from a casual poll initiated by Hampton Roads. The poll asks readers &#8220;Should Norfolk provide funds to prevent the symphony from declaring bankruptcy?&#8221;… <span id="more-3028"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3029" title="correct" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/150x150-ita-guy-072.jpg" alt="correct" width="150" height="150" />At the time this article is published, approximately 65 percent of the more than 1,700 respondents are in favor of such measures. There are a number of comments but those pale in quantity and passion to those posted in conjunction with an article about the topic <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2008/12/virginia-symphony-warns-bankruptcy-without-1m-loan">published</a> in the 12/5/2008 edition of the Virginian-Pilot.</p>
<p>Although unscientific, results from polls such as this are used by politicians during decision making sessions so take a moment to <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/polls/should-norfolk-provide-funds-prevent-symphony-declaring-bankruptcy">cast your vote</a>; although you will need to complete and confirm the hamptonroads.com&#8217;s (unnecessarily long) registration process.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a press release from the Metropolitan Opera, the organization is offering approximately 1,600 $25.00 tickets for weekend performances throughout the remainder of the 2008/09 season. The regular price for these tickets ranges $140.00 to $295.00 and the price difference is being counterbalanced through $3 million in donations from among Board&#8217;s 45 managing directors… <span id="more-3021"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_3022" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3022" title="Hooray" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ita-guy-090.jpg" alt="Kudos to the Met for recognizing the value in lowering ticket prices." width="150" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kudos to the Met for recognizing the value in lowering ticket prices.</p></div>
<p>Based on <a href="http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/press/detail.aspx?id=6390">information</a> from the press release, it appears that approximately 1,600 subsidized seats are going to be distributed over 31 performances which averages to out to approximately 50 seats per show. In order to qualify for the special ticket price, the Met has established a lottery system that operates exclusively through their <a href="http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/contests/drawing/index.aspx">website</a>.</p>
<p>It is particularly heartening to see an organization recognize the value in establishing a fundraising campaign targeted toward lowering ticket prices. At the same time, according the press release this offer is &#8220;in response to the recession&#8221; which would indicate that there are no plans to make the program an ongoing effort from one season to the next. Given the fact that the subsidized tickets only account for approximately 1.3 percent of available seats during each performance, they are in prime seating areas. As such, it would be ideal if the Met would see the value in making this subsidy a permanent part of their fundraising and pricing strategies regardless of economic conditions.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the Met releases any data regarding the numbers of individuals that enter the ticket lottery, the number that follow through and pay for tickets, etc. At the very least, we&#8217;ll have to wait until the end of the season before any sizeable data is likely available. In the meantime, kudos to the Met for moving in a better ticket pricing direction that previous <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/?p=1728">efforts</a> this season.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what feels like the orchestral equivalent of the overhyped <em>Snakes On A Plane</em>, the YouTube Symphony Orchestra fell into the world of online promotion like a cultural bat out of hell. Frankly, I don&#8217;t get why some people see it as such a big deal. The egalitarian slant is quickly revealed to be nothing more than democratic pabulum since Michael Tilson Thomas hand picks the finalists anyway (as <a href="http://theafmobserver.typepad.com/abu_bratsche/2008/12/but-do-they-watch-the-computer-from-behind-a-screen.html">pointed out</a> at Abu Bratsche in true &#8220;Levinesque&#8221; form)… <span id="more-3016"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3017" title="movie film" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ita-guy-098.jpg" alt="movie film" width="150" height="150" />Is it interesting to see someone use a new media format for something culturally oriented? Sure, but ultimately that&#8217;s all there is to this project. Consequently, the entire structure of this scheme doesn&#8217;t merit the status of groundbreaking; in fact, I wouldn&#8217;t be comfortable calling it ground-splintering.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Does anyone remember the first orchestra to be broadcast on television? How about the first orchestra to release a recording on CD or record directly to digital? Me neither; and that is exactly where I think this YouTube project will end up.</p>
<p>From a positive perspective, I do hope this will be the first of many efforts to find better uses for new media platforms with regard to increasing the cultural consciousness. From somewhere a little more cynical, I hope this post is long enough so that I don&#8217;t have to write anything else on the topic. If you&#8217;re looking for more, I <em>highly</em> recommend you head over and read what the <a href="http://irontongue.blogspot.com/2008/12/youtube-symphony.html">Iron Tongue of Midnight</a> has to say about all of this as well as <a href="http://sohothedog.blogspot.com/2008/12/on-small-screen.html">Soho The Dog</a>. Both are chocked full of sufficiently entertaining and meaningful content.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 12/5/2008 edition of the Virginian-Pilot published an article by Teresa Annas which reports on the current cash-crunch at the Virginia Symphony Orchestra (VSO). Although the article does a fine job at reporting on some of the VSO&#8217;s current financial positions and some wonderful efforts by local politicians, there are a few inaccuracies about the orchestra business in general that require correction…<span id="more-3004"></span></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3009" title="150x150-ita-guy-042" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/150x150-ita-guy-042.jpg" alt="150x150-ita-guy-042" width="178" height="150" />Point #1: Define &#8220;rare&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Fist up, the article <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2008/12/virginia-symphony-warns-bankruptcy-without-1m-loan">r</a><a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2008/12/virginia-symphony-warns-bankruptcy-without-1m-loan">eports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;[the organization] is not yet studying what is entailed in a play without pay situation with musicians, which is a rare thing among the nation&#8217;s major orchestras.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, barely six months ago, the Honolulu Symphony musicians agreed to continue performing at the end of the 2006/07 season even though the organization was behind by several weeks of payroll for musicians and administrators (all of which were eventually caught up). The article does mention this example but only in reference to a quote from a VSO musician representative. In addition to Honolulu you can add the number of orchestra musicians which arrange to perform benefit concerts amidst period of no pay induced by work stoppages such as Columbus, Louisville, Jacksonville, St. Louis, and <em>many</em>, <em>many</em> more.</p>
<p><strong>Point #2: Accuracy Counts<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Next, the article misreports information from International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM) chair, Bruce Ridge.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bankruptcy is rare for symphonies, said Bruce Ridge, chairman of the International Conference of Symphony and Orchestra Musicians, an organization of major orchestras of which the Virginia Symphony is a member.</p>
<p>The last bankruptcy of a prominent orchestra that he could recall was the Nashville Symphony about 20 years ago. It shut down for about three months and has since rebounded, he said. Ridge said &#8220;remarkably few&#8221; orchestras have asked musicians to perform without pay. One current example is the Honolulu Symphony.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the article was published, Ridge posted a statement indicating the articles misquote. In fact, Ridge says he mentioned not only the Nashville bankruptcy but the Florida Philharmonic bankruptcy as well. Ridge&#8217;s statement also clarified that he did not recall using the word prominent and that he considers no orchestra any more prominent than any other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even a Google search reveals that several orchestras have filed bankruptcy in the past several years besides Florida Philharmonic such as orchestras in San Diego, San Antonio, San Jose, Tulsa, Savannah, and Colorado Springs.</p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, Good Material Prevails<br />
</strong></p>
<p>On the positive side, the article does a very good job at reporting on the level of involvement from City of Norfolk Mayor Paul D. Fraim who has reportedly done a great deal to assist the VSO and other local arts organizations during periods of cash shortages. It is heartening to see an elected official go top these lengths to work with local performing arts organizations and one would hope that his influence will help ease the VSO past this point and toward improved stability.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is Fraim&#8217;s research into previous actions by the city to provide emergency loans to performing arts organizations that were later repaid with interest.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fraim said he later discovered a precedent exists and told the symphony&#8217;s management about it. Around seven years ago, the authority lent about $250,000 to the Virginia Stage Company, which paid back the money over several years, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got every nickel back, with interest,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent reference point for performing arts organization in other communities to use when looking for solutions to unexpected cash flow shortfalls. Once the Norfolk council makes a decision regarding whether or not to lend the VSO emergency funds after 12/17/2008, it would be interesting to see if there&#8217;s ample material to compose something of a reference piece for other governments to follow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ever sharp Sam Bergman published a fascinating post on 12/3/08 in response to the satirical article published by Holly Mulcahy about how musician behavior can alienate audiences (you have to love cross blog blogging). Sam does a wonderful job at expanding on Holly&#8217;s original premise, especially with regard to root causes which unintentionally develop inadvertent conduct, but it is the end of his article that caught my attention… <span id="more-2988"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_2989" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2989" title="think" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/150x150-ita-guy-075.jpg" alt="Labor relations can be complex and delicate structures worthy of avoiding any potential butterfly effect." width="200" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Due to the complex and delicate nature of most labor relations, it is worthwhile to consider additional options in order to avoid any unintended butterfly effect impact.</p></div>
<p>In particular, Sam suggests that in order to improve some of the detrimental onstage behavior is someone in authority should issue an order that corrects the problems and that&#8217;s that (grumbling and snarling aside). Yet,. I find myself thinking about how labor relations can be complex and delicate structures and in order to avoid any potential <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly effect</a>, I think it would be wise to consider additional options.</p>
<p>Regular readers know that I&#8217;m all about the process and I would suggest that managers use some of the additional pearls from Sam&#8217;s article to approach this issue with their musicians. In particular, take the following passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;…we [behave this way] because we literally don&#8217;t know any better. Musicians, alone among performing arts professionals, are never, at any point in their training, taught to be performers. We&#8217;re taught how to play music, and how to take direction. No one ever teaches us the tricks that actors, dancers, and singers learn, such as how to make the whole auditorium feel like you&#8217;re looking at them, how to walk across a stage without ever putting your back to the audience, or how to take a curtain call.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the past several years, there has been a great deal of time, effort, and resources dedicated to issues of musician professional development or other such projects, such as those from the Mellon Orchestra Forum. I can only think of the potential positive impact that could have been realized if a program such as that allocated some of its ample resources to these issues. I already know of some orchestras which have worked on these topics by bringing in a paid professional to work on this issue (like a stage coach) and if approached from this perspective, I believe that the end result might get the most out of mandating improved stage decorum.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m interested in hearing any firsthand accounts of efforts which address the issues identified in the articles from Holly and Sam. If you have something to share, please send it in as a comment. In the meantime, you can read Holly&#8217;s <a href="http://www.partialobserver.com/article.cfm?id=3118&amp;RSS=1">article</a> here and Sam&#8217;s <a href="http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/insidetheclassics/blog/">entire post</a> over at the diminutive font sized Minnesota Orchestra blog, Inside The Classics.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I pointed readers to an article written by Mark Stryker in the 11/26/08 edition of the Detroit Free Press which examined the current state of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra finances. In that article, Mark reports that the organization is experiencing a decline in ticket sales and a recent sudden drop in financial support will only compound economic issues. At hand, is the quandary of how an organization in the midst of a sizeable, sudden budget shortfall will go about attracting increased numbers of ticket buyers with fewer marketing resources and no room to tolerate lower ticket revenue… <span id="more-2984"></span></p>
<p>Mark&#8217;s <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081126/ENT04/811260326">article</a> points out that the result of less disposable income among potential ticket buyers may result in an increase in the decline of concertgoers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The DSO, like all metro Detroit arts institutions, has been trying to broaden its base of support in recent years, but in an economic climate where corporations are laying off workers, potential concertgoers are choosing less expensive entertainment options…&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2985" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2985" title="on-two punch" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ita-guy-089.jpg" alt="Are orchestras setting themselves up for a one-two economic punch as a result of ticket pricing strategies?" width="150" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Are orchestras setting themselves up for a one-two economic punch as a result of ticket pricing strategies?</p></div>
<p>Add to this the fact that for most orchestras, the average ticket price has increased exponentially over the past few decades, well ahead of the accessible rates for middle class ticket buyers. Peter Dobrin at the Philadelphia Inquirer ran an excellent <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/?p=673">article</a> on the topic using the Philadelphia Orchestra as an example and if most orchestras have followed the trend he identified, then they may have set themselves up for a vicious one-two punch at the hand of the current economy.</p>
<p>On one hand, the allure of squeezing ticket revenue through raising ticket prices at the risk of slowly bleeding away average attendance rates has been something of an acceptable loss for some organizations. The thought here is you can maintain that balance for a period of time while other revenue streams are cultivated to a point where the trend can be scaled back. Ideally, the stronger revenue streams will then provide enough of a financial net to help marginalize any risk associated with lost ticket revenue from stronger audience development efforts through lower ticket prices.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this robbing from Peter to pay Paul scenario carries a number of dynamic risks and the sudden change in the national economy will undoubtedly trigger some of the negative consequences from inflated average ticket prices. Regardless, this isn&#8217;t about finger pointing but it is about learning from current practices and taking proper action to certify the value of increased audience development and retention rates that are capable of withstanding sudden economic shocks.</p>
<p>Traditionally, American businesses have done a good job at learning from past mistakes and there is no reason to believe that this field should be any different. As a result, I hope this issue will finally assume a prominent place in the national dialog and creative problem solving will become a centerpiece in formal discussions. After all, the alternative is to continue clinging to failed principals and hope that the Federal Government decides to begin bailing out nonprofit performing arts organizations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partialobserver.com/article.cfm?id=3118&amp;RSS=1"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2978" title="Musician" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ita-guy-078.jpg" alt="Musician" width="150" height="150" /></a>I have yet to encounter a manager that doesn&#8217;t have a good musician anecdote (and vice versa) and Holly captures some of the root behaviors at the source of many of those stories. Next month, Holly promises to focus on how managers alienate the audience. I&#8217;m anxious to see what transpires but in the meantime, I&#8217;ll have to make do with this month&#8217;s <a href="http://www.partialobserver.com/article.cfm?id=3118&amp;RSS=1">installment</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest Cultural Confidence update indicates that the slight upturn in the economic outlook for cultural institutions experienced around the national elections was short lived. Results from the most recent polling cycle indicate that not only do more people feel that their institution&#8217;s current economic situation is degrading but their economic outlook sank to a new low since polling began… <span id="more-2962"></span></p>
<p>Over the past two months, the ratio of respondents who feel that the economic conditions at their orchestra will be &#8220;poor&#8221; (the lowest available option) has risen steadily each cycle whereas the ratio of respondents who feel that their economic conditions at their orchestra will be excellent (the highest option available) has dropped from a small percentage to zero. The chart below illustrates the current trends.</p>
<div id="attachment_2965" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 431px"><a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cultural-economic-outlook-t.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2965" title="cultural-economic-outlook-trends" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cultural-economic-outlook-t.jpg" alt="cultural-economic-outlook-trends" width="421" height="173" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">click to enlarge</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2964" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ita-guy-101.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2964" title="spending impact" src="http://www.adaptistration.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ita-guy-101.jpg" alt="Better than expected holiday spending may have a positive impact on the cultural economic outlook." width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Better than expected holiday spending may boost to the cultural economic outlook.</p></div>
<p>At the same time, the large number of variables impacting the economy such as the change in presidential leadership in January and where the Federal Government will direct the remaining bailout funds may reverse these trends. Add to that the initial news surrounding higher than expected levels of holiday spending and a push toward increased lending and some of these attitudes may change.</p>
<p>Consequently, if you haven&#8217;t cast your vote in the current poll cycle then <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/?page_id=2276"><strong>VOTE NOW</strong></a>.</p>
