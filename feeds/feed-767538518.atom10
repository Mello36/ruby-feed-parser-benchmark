			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 170px"><a href="http://vimeo.com/2349146"><img title="Video - ATI Bubble Master 200 unboxing" src="http://images.vimeo.com/19/99/18/199918184/199918184_160.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Video - ATI Bubble Master 200 unboxing</p></div>
<p>I have just received an ATI Bubble Master 200 protein skimmer, and wanted to share my initial impressions.  For reference, my previous skimmer was an ASM.  The skimmer cost $549, which puts it above budget skimmers, but still not at the level of a Korallen Zucht, or Bubble King.  It is rated for 250 gallon aquariums, which is over-rated for my 135 gallon tank, but should allow me to keep a high bioload.</p>
<h3>Packaging</h3>
<p>The skimmer was ordered from <a href="http://www.aquariumspecialty.com">AquariumSpecialty.com</a>.  As you can see in the unboxing video, the skimmer was protected by custom-cut foam.  It was extremely thick and the unit arrived in perfect condition.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>The skimmer is solid.  No part of the unit feels cheap, and the body does not flex when squeezed.  Attention to detail is obvious, with the easy to adjust knife valve and rubber feet on both the skimmer foot and pump.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The instructions which come with the unit are clear and understandable.  I do have a complaint here.  On every online vendor where you can purchase this skimmer, it says &#8220;In-sump in up to 8&#8243; of water&#8221;.  The instructions make this more clear, they state: &#8220;For optimal performance the water height should not exceed 8&#8243;. (Ideally 6-7&#8243;)&#8221;  I wish that the 6-7&#8243; note accompanied the advertisement online.  My sump was made to be 8&#8243; deep; had I known that 6-7&#8243; is ideal I would have made it to that specification.</p>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Putting the skimmer together required no tools or plumbing.  One of the main reasons I chose this particular skimmer is ATIs use of a knife gate valve for adjustment.  This means no extra plumbing required, and no getting your hands wet.  The collection cup simply rests on the body, sealed by the weight of the (large) cup and a rubber gasket.  This makes removal easy.</p>
<p>For a glimpse at the assembly process, check out my <a href="http://vimeo.com/2349146">unboxing video</a>.</p>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>Installation was definitely plug-and-play.  After assembling the unit dry, I simply dropped it into my sump and plugged in the pump.  The unit started skimming wet within minutes.  I&#8217;ve had to tune it down as the skimmer breaks in so that I can find where the sweet spot is.  The <span class="main">ATI-Sicce pump has a slight hum to it, which may be due to my placement, but it is not annoying or distracting.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I am extremely happy with my purchase, and in the few hours the skimmer has been running, I already have about 1&#8243; of wet skimmate.  I feel it will be capable of dealing with my bioload as my tank matures.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_102" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 154px"><a href="http://www.afex2win.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dsc_0279.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-102" title="My old aquarium" src="http://www.afex2win.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dsc_0279-300x200.jpg" alt="The stand was fun to build, but it simply was not worth the space or effort" width="144" height="96" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My old stand was fun to build, but it simply was not worth the space or effort</p></div>
<p>one of the requirements i set for myself with this tank is that i wanted it to be simple, both in appearance and function.  part of this meant that i could not make the mistake i did when building the stand of my last tank. (see photo on right) the excessive size and side cabinets took away from the tank more than they added.  also, the traditional look with the wood finish and trim everywhere grew old very quickly.  my tastes lean more towards contemporary design, and for this project i needed a stand to match.</p>
<p>when designing my new tank, i decided to have the tank be lower (30&#8243; height compared to 45&#8243; height).  this meant that if i used a traditional stand with doors, my access would be very limited.  also, since the tank is as wide as it is long, reaching the back of the stand would be problematic.  very quickly i compiled my design list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple, both in design and function</li>
<li>Accessible from all 3 sides</li>
<li>Easy access to each side</li>
<li>Allow ventilation but keep the cat out!</li>
</ul>
<p>i decided that not having doors at all would allow me the access i needed while providing me with the aesthetics i desired.  it also occurred to me that having a steel stand afforded me some choices that standard wood stands do not have: the use of magnets to attach the skin.  by doing this i am able to keep the stand looking very sleek and at the same time provide extremely simple and easy access, including removing the entire skin (back included).</p>
<p>the plan was set: skin my stand with 3 independent panels which were held magnetically to the steel stand.  as a note, this entire process assumes that you have a steel frame.  my stand was built for me by <a href="http://www.acrylicandglassexhibits.com/">A.G.E.</a> and the construction process for that is out of the scope of this article.</p>
<h2>Shopping list</h2>
<ol>
<li>Primer/Sealer (I used KILZ Premium)</li>
<li>Paint of your choice (I used &#8220;Dark Kettle Black&#8221; from Veldspar)</li>
<li>Separate brush for each</li>
<li>3 pieces of plywood, cut to size</li>
<li>1 piece of pegboard, cut to size</li>
<li>Magnets of your choice (I used some <a href="http://www.gaussboys.com/ndfeb-magnets/D1803E.html">rare earth magnets from gaussboys.com</a>)</li>
<li>Epoxy to attach magnets (I used Sumo glue from Loctite)</li>
<li>Vinyl bumpers</li>
<li>Zip ties</li>
</ol>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 110px"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2897645751/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2897645751_8b4f057f53_t.jpg" alt="...a few hours later" width="100" height="67" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Painting in the sun turned out to be a mistake.</p></div>
<p>To start, <strong>please</strong> don&#8217;t make the mistake i did when painting.  namely, painting in direct sunlight.  as i found out through <a href="http://reefcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1484052">my reefcentral thread</a>, painting in the sun caused the top of the paint to dry earlier than the undercoat and makes it take forever to cure.  More than a week later, and my paint is still sticky.</p>
<p>I used 2 coats of primer for each piece of wood (including the bottom provided by A.G.E.).  This is to protect the wood from the moisture and salt which will eventually get everywhere.  After that dried, i put 2 coats of the paint on the 3 pieces of the skin.</p>
<p>Now comes the magic part of my plan.  Since we&#8217;re using magnets, the hard part is over!  There is no nailing, screwing, or staining left to do.  All that is left to do is attach the magnets.  I chose to have the front piece be wide enough to cover the edges of the two side pieces, so in order to line it all up, i placed each piece where it should go and traced the legs of the stand using a pencil.  This gives me a guideline for where i should place the magnets.  Attaching them is as simple as a squeeze of the glue, and a firm press.  This particular glue takes about an hour to cure.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 110px"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2898488620/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3263/2898488620_42517735d9_t.jpg" alt="gluing magnets to skin" width="100" height="67" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tracing the frame makes placing the magnets easy.</p></div>
<p>I also put some vinyl bumpers on the bottom of each piece to protect my floor.  One option i may switch to in the future is to attach some plastic angle brackets to the inside of each piece.   I would place the bracket at the level where i want it to meet the bottom of the stand, and it would simply rest on the bottom holding the weight of the wood.  This way there would still be nothing permanently attaching the wood to the stand, and the sides do not have to be at ground level.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 110px"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2923900522/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3251/2923900522_d44956e136_t.jpg" alt="making access holes" width="100" height="67" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ready to mount</p></div>
<p>For the back of the stand, here is where that pegboard we got comes into play.  Again focused on ease of maintenance, we&#8217;ll be using zip ties to attach a piece of pegboard to the back of the stand.  This serves many purposes in a simple package.  It allows ventilation, it keeps my cat out of the stand, and as an added bonus allows me to attach equipment (non-permanently) to get things off the bottom and away from splashes.  Pictured is my Profilux Digital Powerbar attached to the pegboard.  I&#8217;ve cut away the two corners to provide a way to run cables into and out of the back of the stand.  To attach, simply run the zip ties through the holes and around the legs of the stand.</p>
<p>An alternative for a magnetic skin is to not use wood, but plastic.  I debated on using simple colored acrylic or even starboard for each side.  And depending on how i feel, i may switch to one of those options.  I still think a semi transparent black acrylic would be pretty great to use for a very sleek look. (Plus no painting!)</p>
<p>Here is my finished product!</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 387px"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2898485430/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/2898485430_73a14b0bc2.jpg" alt="skinned aquarium stand" width="377" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The completed stand. Functional and simple.</p></div>
<p>I hope the detailing of the construction of my stand has given you some insight and ideas on how to put together a simple stand yourself.  Check out some more pictures!</p>

<p>with some amazing help from my neighbor and some industrious college guys, we hauled the tank up the stairs today and plopped it on the stand.  i cleaned it up as best i could with a wet rag to get it picture ready, and had a bit of a photoshoot. (this is probably the cleanest the tank will ever be)</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2881806572/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/2881806572_c9265416d2_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5246.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2880970075/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/2880970075_1724b692e2_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5244.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2881804210/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3171/2881804210_9cee8bdb67_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5237.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2880968989/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3093/2880968989_6e48ba0fee_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5239.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2880969477/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2880969477_bd5be6cb5e_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5242.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2880967297/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3176/2880967297_65c0aa53a0_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5233.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2880967805/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3101/2880967805_1be4da5f26_t.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_5234.JPG" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Thumbnail" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afex2win/2880985477/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2880985477_6e6629aa5b_t.jpg" border="0" alt="my tank and i" width="100" height="67" /></a></p>
<p>next on my agenda is to skin the stand.  instead of your standard stand with doors, my plan is to make the stand look like a sealed box when closed, but have the sides not permanently attached so i can remove any side at any time.  i&#8217;ve already ordered the magnets to secure the plywood to the stand, but was waiting to get the wood until i had the tank setup so i could measure exactly.  the skin will cover the base of the tank as well as the silicone.  for the back panel i&#8217;ll be using some peg board to help with ventilation and attaching stuff.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve ordered my pump as well as the loc-line fittings, so hopefully soon i&#8217;ll be able to finalize my plumbing.  i&#8217;ve also ordered my profilux plus II ex controller, but mostly b/c i&#8217;ve been waiting for weeks in order to start programming against it. :]</p>
<p>now the fun begins.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>as with all things, they have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>the beginning of my reef includes a freight truck and crates!</p>

<p>i placed the order with <a href="http://www.acrylicandglassexhibits.com/">Acrylic &amp; Glass Exhibits</a> on June 26th, delivery was on September 12th, about 11 weeks later.  They said that normally an order takes 6-8 weeks to fulfill, but the starphire glass was back ordered.  once my glass came in the tank was ready in about 2 weeks.  everybody at A.G.E. was great to work with, especially Chris B.  I was able to easily contact him at any time to ask questions and get status updates. i was even able to make a change to my stand&#8217;s height just one week before it was scheduled to be built, with no problems.  overall, a fantastic experience.</p>
<p>peaking into the crate, i can tell that this tank was worth every penny.  honestly, this may be the only tank i&#8217;ll ever need to own.  the build quality is top notch, including the silicone work and custom overflow with cover.</p>
<p>the tank is still sitting in my garage, waiting on me to find some more guys to help me haul it up 3 flights of stairs.  that will be very tricky, since this thing is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">heavy</span></strong>.  i figure 4-6 people should be able to handle it, but the real hard part will be turning the tank on its side and fitting all those people in the stairwell!  time will tell&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>when planning a tank, it&#8217;s easy to over-engineer many facets of the setup.  for example, the stand for my old 75g tank could have probably held a tank 4x the size.  it was unnecessary and ended up causing me tons of grief when trying to deal with moving the tank.  many times this complexity is added in the form of filtering equipment.  i always tell people that reefing is just as much an engineering hobby as it is a biology one.  some tanks are better described as a mad scientist&#8217;s lair than a fish tank.  <a href="http://www.weatherson.com/photos/603_tank-back_labelled_1K.jpg">here&#8217;s an example of that in weatherson&#8217;s fish room</a>.  i think that&#8217;s great, actually.  this hobby can be whatever you make it.  it&#8217;s not about wrong or right, its about what makes you enjoy your tank and the act of maintaining it.</p>
<p>but for me, i realized that simplicity is more desirable.  living in a modern apartment means having to make compromises, especially when overall aesthetics is one of things you are trying to focus on.  i too almost fell into the &#8220;just one more thing&#8221; trap of equipment planning.  for some insight, my plan at one point included manifolds on both the return and drain lines to feed my reactors, chiller, refugium and skimmer! talk about complicated&#8230;</p>
<p>so i took a hard look at my plan and started stripping out the unnecessary.  now my only problem will be how to organize everything under the stand!  here is my current equipment list, subject to change of course :]</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.atiaquaristik.com/index.php?id=124,0,0,1,0,0">ATI Powermodule 10&#215;39w</a> T5HO fixture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Filtration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> Custom acrylic sump 24&#215;16x16 (2 compartment), built by <a href="http://www.krittertanks.com/index.htm">Kritter</a></li>
<li> Nutrient export via bacterial strains supplied by <a href="http://www.prodibio.fr/anglais/accueil.htm">Prodibio</a> system (or similar: <a href="http://www.zeovitusa.com/">Zeovit</a>, etc)</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.aquariumspecialty.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=34_293&amp;products_id=1756">ATI Bubble Master 160</a> Skimmer</li>
<li> 2x TLF Phosban Reactors (1 carbon, 1 GFO)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.pentairaquatics.com/products/detail/quiet_one/Q1_3000.html">Quiet One 3000</a> return pump</li>
<li> 2x <a href="http://www.tunze.com/149.html?&amp;L=1&amp;C=US&amp;user_tunzeprod_pi1[predid]=-infoxunter052">Tunze 6055 Nanostreams</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supplementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.faunamarin.de/bedienungsanleitung/manual_balling-methode_eng.pdf">&#8220;Balling light&#8221; method</a> via Profilux dosing pumps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring/Controlling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ghl-kl.de/Produkte/Aquaristik/Download/Produktkatalog05-08-Englisch_web.pdf">GHL Profilux Plus II Ex</a> reef controller
<ul>
<li>Temperature, pH, Redox, Salinity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heating/Cooling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> Standard aquarium heater</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.ghl-kl.de/Produkte/Aquaristik/Download/Produktkatalog05-08-Englisch_web.pdf">GHL Propeller Breeze 3-fan</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Auto Topoff</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> Undecided RO/DI reservoir*</li>
<li> via Profilux controller and dosing pumps</li>
</ul>
<p><small>* I still haven&#8217;t found good containers to store water for top-off and water changes.  Since these either have to fit under my stand or behind a nearby screen I&#8217;m limited by size, so BRUTE trashcans or anything that big just won&#8217;t work.  <a href="http://www.bayteccontainers.com/new15galwaba.html">These containers</a> look promising, but mixing salt water doesn&#8217;t seem feasible since they are not open top.  Still looking for suggestions!</small></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice a few &#8220;key&#8221; components missing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chiller</strong>.  By using T5HO instead of metal halide, this allows me to use evaporative cooling as the primary means of temperature control.  Also, since I live in San Francisco, other than for a few weeks in the summer the average high temperature here is between 60-70° F.</li>
<li><strong>Refugium</strong>.  Due to the fact that I plan on using bacterial means to remove nitrate and phosphate from my tank, a refugium would only effectively serve as a home for pods.  I don&#8217;t plan on keeping fish who have pods as their primary diet, so I should be OK there.</li>
<li><strong>Calcium Reactor</strong>.  As you can probably tell by now, my tank is heavily influenced by successful European tanks. (Both functionally and stylistically)  Even though I have no personal experience with this, I&#8217;ve decided to jump in and try out the <a href="http://www.faunamarin.de/bedienungsanleitung/manual_balling-methode_eng.pdf">&#8220;balling light&#8221; method</a>.  It seems very similar to popular &#8220;2-part&#8221; methods currently used in the US, but more robust in terms of overall element balance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully with this setup I&#8217;ll be able to keep an outstanding SPS tank with a simple and efficient equipment setup.  Any and all feedback welcome!</p>
<p>Here are some more sketchup mocks to help me visualize how everything will come together.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>i could only stay away for so long, it seems.  i&#8217;m back in the reef game in a big way. (ironically exactly one year after my last post)</p>
<p>i almost went with a nano tank (like 20 gallons or so), but that plan slowly morphed into a 60g tank, and then a 100g tank, and i eventually settled on a 135 gallon tank!</p>
<p>i just ordered my tank and stand yesterday from A.G.E. in Houston, and will have to wait 4-8 weeks for delivery. :[  in the meantime i can plan my other equipment and/or invent a time machine.  still undecided.</p>
<p>Tank:</p>
<ul>
<li>36&#215;36x24, 135G</li>
<li>Reef Ready</li>
<li>Rimless with Beveled glass</li>
<li>Starphire glass on 3 sides</li>
<li>Black back pane</li>
<li>PVC bottom pane</li>
</ul>
<p>Stand</p>
<ul>
<li>Powder-coated steel frame</li>
<li>Adjustable feet</li>
<li>36&#215;36x33</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve mocked up a drawing in sketchup to help me plan.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>this in not an april fool&#8217;s post. i really am revamping the plugin.</em></p>
<p>so <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">wordpress</a> recently released their latest <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">version 2.5</a>.  the main changes revolved around the administration console, so i decided to install it into my development environment and check to see if it broke my hacker&#8217;s diet plugin functionality.  luckily it didn&#8217;t (that I could tell), but while surfing around the new menus I had a bit of an inspirational moment.  i visualized how my plugin would best fit in with their new look.  i quickly sketched down my idea and got to work.  it turned out to be a case study on usability.</p>
<p>since starting my job @ <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a>, my focus on the user has been amplified.  generally speaking, i specialize in back-end development.  that means that most of the code i write isn&#8217;t what you see, it&#8217;s what turns the wheels behind the scenes.  but since my background is in web development, i sometimes like to brush off my CSS skills and make something that people will interact with.  placing yourself in the spot of the user and asking &#8220;what&#8217;s the best way to give the user exactly what they need, but not overwhelm them?&#8221; is a great way to really flesh out your feature set.  it requires bringing the important stuff to the forefront and keeping the less important things hidden until needed or even discarded altogether.</p>
<p>when i first made my plugin, the question driving my design was &#8220;what features do i need to have in order to replicate the diet plan?&#8221; this time around, i had more to draw from.  namely: a year and a half (wow) of plugging in my weight every morning, and tons of feedback from users.</p>
<p>so what came out of my rethinking?  as a user, i need a few important things right at my fingertips:</p>
<ul>
<li>putting in <strong>today&#8217;s</strong> weight</li>
<li>finding out my current &#8220;real&#8221; weight</li>
<li>seeing how that weight has changed recently so i can adjust if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>and that&#8217;s really it! anything that doesn&#8217;t fall within those 3 items has been de-emphasized.  the other features still exist, but there is no reason to have any of that stuff on the main plugin page, &#8220;above the fold&#8221;. (which means stuff you see without scrolling down)  how often do you really go back and add/change a weight for a previous day? once a month, maybe?  so why clutter the page with all that old stuff when what you really want is today&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>and of course i gave the UI a little polish.  i switched out the graph to use <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/">YUI charts</a> so that gd is no longer required and so the charts are much more interactive.  round corners are still in, right? :]</p>
<p>look for an update &#8220;soon&#8221;.  (1-2 week timeframe)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>so firstly&#8230; <a href="http://live.yahoo.com">live.yahoo.com</a>!  welcome to what i&#8217;ve been working on for the past 6 months!</p>
<p>Y! Live basically allows you to have your own internet TV channel, where you can also interact with your audience via real-time chat and being able to see them if they also have their camera on while watching you.  the really cool part is that since this is web-based, you don&#8217;t have to install anything. (except for Flash, but i&#8217;m gonna go out on a limb and guess you already have that installed :])</p>
<p>we think that musicians will really dig this b/c it would allow them to perform live online whenever they want.  the example i give when explaining it, is that a band could bring their laptop to practice in the garage and let the world watch.  they could probably get alot more fans that way. (since you can also easily embed the video into your myspace page, for example.)</p>
<p>this was also my first launch at Yahoo! since starting in June.  I joined the team right when this project was kicking off, so it has been really cool to see how it evolved over time.  the plan now is to keep the site running full steam, and then start working on making it cooler.  we have alot of plans for new features, but decided that getting it public sooner was better.  we have a blog setup at <a href="http://yliveblog.com">yliveblog.com</a> so if you do the RSS thing, feel free to subscribe b/c i&#8217;m sure any new features will be posted there.  (we also have a <a href="http://twitter.com/ylive">twitter</a>, but does anybody back home even know what twitter is?)</p>
<p>launch day was pretty crazy too.  thursday started off interestingly, b/c we found out that my manager was in the ER all nite.  we were all freaked out by that, and then he shows up to work with a broken arm! (long story, lol)  but luckily we had the site ready to go and were just waiting on final approval from teams like Customer Care, Legal and Paranoids (security group).   after some last minute tinkering to get them to sign off, we open the site up around 5pm.  we popped open the champagne and beer and started using the site with the public.</p>
<p>the response was overwhelming! we got posted on some tech news sites, and digg. (at one point kevin rose&#8217;s channel was full of diggers) unfortunately we hit some &#8220;technical difficulties&#8221; and i spent from about midnight to 5AM trying to figure out what was misconfigured and how with my superhero coworker, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/premshree/">premshree</a>.  we turned the site back on, played the inaugural game of ping-pong in our <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/balls-of-fury">break room</a> and then spent the rest of the morning watching the site.  luckily i was able to sneak in a nap today from 9am-2pm! :]</p>
<p>all in all, i&#8217;m extremely proud of what we&#8217;ve accomplished in this short period of time (the site was made by 6 people, in 6 months) and i hope everybody at least tries it out once. :P</p>
<p>here are my channels.  when you go, i may or may not be live.</p>
