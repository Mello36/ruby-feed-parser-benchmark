For marketers seeking to use the video channel as a promotion tool, wouldn&#8217;t it be handy if you could predict which of several videos was more likely to succeed on the Web?

		<description><![CDATA[	National Public Radio aired a 30-minute interview with Buyology author Martin Lindstrom yesterday:
	Lindstrom says companies create rituals around their products — drinking Corona with a lime, or eating an Oreo cookie filling-first — in an attempt to integrate their products into habitual, comforting, daily activities.

Once a brand achieves that elusive status as a recognized luxury item, that status itself can drive sales to wealthy consumers, not to mention those who would like to appear to be wealthy.

Want your customers to trust you?  Demonstrate that you trust THEM!  This may seem counterintuitive, but there&#8217;s sound neuromarketing reasoning behind it.  The concept revolves around that seemingly magical neurochemical, oxytocin, which is a key factor in forming trust relationships.  Paul J. Zak, director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at [...]]]></description>

	Why a logical product lineup may not be the most profitable
	&#160;
	When marketers plan a company&#8217;s product offerings, they usually try to do so in the most logical way possible.  Several levels of product may be offered - a stripped-down, basic version, a more capable better version, and perhaps a &#8220;best&#8221; version.  These would [...]]]></description>

Have you ever received a printed invitation to, say, a charity fundraiser, and found that someone you know on the organizing committee had hand-written a short note encouraging you to attend?  (Or sat in a room with other people actually scribbling such notes, periodically asking questions like, &#8220;Who knows Elmer and Dolly Pennington?&#8221;)  [...]]]></description>

A few weeks ago I created a new category here, &#8220;Neuromanagement,&#8221; which fits a couple of posts I&#8217;ve got simmering on the back burner.  While those are geared toward the positive use of neuro-techniques in managing and hiring, there&#8217;s a breaking news story about the dangerous physiological effects of bad management.

One effect of the publication of Martin Lindstrom&#8217;s Buyology book has been a significant uptick in media coverage of neuromarketing.  Lindstrom has scored a few high-visibility TV interviews (e.g., Today Show and Australian TV), and plenty of print and online media coverage.
