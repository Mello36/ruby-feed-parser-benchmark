&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/12/a-look-under-the-hood-of-a-field-study-research-in-context.html"&gt;prior post&lt;/a&gt; revealed some of the guiding principles and purpose of Contextual Research vs. other methods and resources analysts leverage when examining various business, organizational and IT trends. In this post, I wanted to share some of the high-level data points on how this particular field research study was conducted.  &#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;CR projects are approved by Burton Group management. Analysts leading CR projects are trained on the methodology and are mentored by other CR project leads as needed. A project proposal to conduct a CR field research project on the topic of social networking within the enterprise was submitted for internal review. After approval, this particular CR project was conducted in three phases. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1: Call for Participation&lt;/strong&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;An open “call for participation” was made public on August, 19, 2008. To raise awareness of the project, notifications were published on &lt;a href="http://ccsblog.burtongroup.com/collaboration_and_content/2008/08/participation-i.html"&gt;Burton Group blogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/08/index.html"&gt;analyst blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. E-Mail invitations were also circulated to Burton Group clients, industry mailing lists (e.g., knowledge management communities) and vendors. Several points in the call for participation phase are worth noting: &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The project was open to clients and non-clients alike, and there was no charge for participation (e.g., any necessary travel expenses were borne by Burton Group) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Representatives from business and IT areas were asked to participate &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;A combination of face-to-face and telephone interviews would be used to gather the data &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Confidentiality and review procedures were addressed &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;All participating organizations would receive the resulting research and have the opportunity to discuss its findings with Burton Group &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for Phase 1 was to have 25 organizations involved in the study. Each participating organization was asked to make one to three people available for interviews. Burton Group was looking for representatives from line-of-business groups, human resources (HR) department and IT organizations. If desired, group interviews were allowed but it was strongly recommended that non-technical and technical participants be interviewed separately. As the effort moved into the next phase, the plan was to have one-third of the interviews conducted on a face-to-face basis with telephone interviews rounding out the study. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Although 25 organizations did agree to participate initially, 4 later dropped out, leaving 21 study sponsors. The industry breakdown (guided by industry sectors assigned to company profiles by Yahoo! Finance) was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="427"&gt;&#xD;

&lt;td width="180"&gt;Academic institutions&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;

&lt;tr&gt;&#xD;

&lt;tr&gt;&#xD;

&lt;td width="180"&gt;Biotechnology, drug manufacturers, health provides, hospitals, etc.&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td align="middle" width="117"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;tr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td width="132"&gt;Services&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td width="180"&gt;Consumer services, discount and variety stores, electronics, home improvement, medical equipment, travel agencies, etc.&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td align="middle" width="117"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;tr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td width="132"&gt;Technology&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td width="180"&gt;Computer-related&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td align="middle" width="117"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;tr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td width="132"&gt;Utilities&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td width="180"&gt;Electric, gas, water&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;
&lt;td align="middle" width="117"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Sometimes the industry sector was raised up one level to avoid study participant from being identified if they were the only one in a particular category. For example, consumer goods is a subset of services but since there were three sponsoring firms, that category was broken out. Basic Materials is a broad category but since there was only one study participant in a sub-sector under Basic Materials, the higher-level grouping was used. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2: “LEARN”&lt;/strong&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 concentrated on a sequence of steps referred to as “LEARN”, which stands for logistics (e.g., defining schedules), engagement (e.g., conducting the interview sessions), assessment (analyzing and consolidating interview data), review (e.g., allowing organizations to fact-check information) and next steps (e.g., creating the study deliverables). This phase of the study was carried out over a two month timeframe from September 15, 2008 through November 7, 2008. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The high level of sponsor interest in social networks was reflected by the large number of people involved in the actual interview process: &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;8 firms provided a single person to be interviewed &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;13 firms providing multiple people to be interviewed &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;65 people (roughly) participated in interview sessions across 21 sponsoring organizations &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;These larger commitments were handled either in group sessions or through a series of one-on-one interviews: &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;30 interview sessions averaging 90 minutes each &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;45 hours of conversation with study participants&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Interview sessions were fairly equally divided between representatives of business and IT areas: &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;13 interviews with line-of-business and HR personnel (27 people) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;17 interviews with representatives from IT organizations (38 people) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Each interview produced roughly 15 pages of notes. These notes formed the baseline for subsequent “interpretation sessions” with Burton Group analysts on the CR team. Interpretations sessions provide a forum to review data collected during the interview. An interpretation session was held for each interview session and tended to average 90 minutes each. These review meetings served two purposes. First, it allowed the CR project lead to socialize interviews with team members to develop a shared perspective. Second, they were a “sense-making” process that allowed the CR team to immerse themselves in the data, assess data collected from the interview, and co-create a series of stand-alone observations (referred to as “affinity statements”). Affinity statements reflect not only the stories shared by participants but also include Burton Group’s analysis of those stories. The approach created an enormous amount of information: &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;60 affinity statements created on average per interpretation session &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;1700 individual affinity statements (approximately) created for use during the consolidation session &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;After completing all interviews and interpretations sessions, the focus shifted to analyzing individual affinity statements to identify underlying patterns in the data (regardless of organization). The project team met over a four day period to analyze each affinity statement. Using a bottoms-up approach, “like statements” were sorted, filtered and clustered into groups with each group receiving a label summarizing its key point. Groups of groups, with a second layer of labeling, were then shaped into a three-layer hierarchy with the top layer assigned a key theme for that hierarchy. Sequencing the collection of themes into a coherent storyline completed the exercise. Analysts then examined the narrative created and provided a final set of comments to complete the consolidation session. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3: Analysis &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The last phase of the project began in December, 2008 and will likely continue into April, 2009. Providing deliverables to participating organizations and to Burton Group clients will occur through a series of documents that analyze study findings, formulate research positions and provide strategic recommendation to organizations regarding social networking within the enterprise. Non-clients will be offered the opportunity to discuss study findings. Burton Group clients can exercise their normal interaction options (e.g., telephone inquiry or onsite briefing) to discuss the study as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I'll provide some additional reflections along with some snapshots of the team taken during the consolidation session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I have been immersed in a field research project on the topic of social networks within the enterprise. It has consumed a tremendous amount of my time - especially since late September through mid-November. I've posted &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/11/project-status-social-networking-within-the-enterprise.html"&gt;previous project status updates&lt;/a&gt; but I wanted to also provide additional background information on "Contextual Research", (a Burton Group term), which defined the structure and approach used in the study: &#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Contextual Research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Contextual Research (CR) is a people-centric approach towards gathering data from the field and using it to formulate research positions and recommendations that support the IT strategies of Burton Group clients. The CR process leverages methods associated with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry"&gt;Contextual Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_design"&gt;Contextual Design&lt;/a&gt;. Burton Group has adapted these tactics and integrated them within its research model. The result is a hybrid approach where relevant practices leveraged within contextual inquiry and contextual design initiatives are combined with the in-depth technology analysis that distinguishes Burton Group in the industry. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Is This Approach Different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;CR augments Burton Group’s IT research framework. CR is unique in that it is driven by the people participating in the field study rather than by analysts. Study participants tell their own stories with minimal guidance or prompting. Analysts primarily act as observers. The proactive interaction that does occur is done by the analyst to: help facilitate the conversation within the study’s focus area, confirm statements made by participants (to clarify what was said), explore statements more deeply, or ask participants to elaborate on peripheral comments that raise interesting points. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical interactions between customers and analysts (where analysts address issues as the subject-matter expert), participants in a CR study are themselves considered the subject matter expert. Within a CR project, it is the analyst who acts as if they were the apprentice (there primarily to observe, listen and extract meaningful information without preconceived assumptions of what is right or wrong). This non-intrusive, ethnographic-like approach captures an enormous amount of factual and opinionated information. When combined with stories from other study participants, the collective data represents a unique corpus of perspectives on a topic that is not easily duplicated through other means (e.g., vendor briefings, industry surveys, traditional customer inquiries, and other news sources). &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer use of social networks has been extensively covered in the media. Many stories have discussed how such technologies are used by young adults entering the workforce. The topic has also been covered in business/technology press and on numerous blogs where articles frequently discuss internal social networks. Vendors have also been jumping on the bandwagon, marketing their solutions as “social platforms” (e.g., Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0). These trends have raised the visibility of social networking as an issue business and IT decision-makers need to address. Burton Group has received an rising number of inquiries from clients on the topic. Clients cite a myriad of reasons as to why social networking within the enterprise has become a “hot topic”. Reasons for deploying social networking tools are generally categorized in the following ways: &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Provide technology expected by younger workers (i.e., “Gen Y”) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Augment strategic talent initiatives (e.g., recruitment, alumni) and address aging workforce pressures &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance team collaboration and community-building efforts &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage knowledge held by employees (i.e., knowledge management strategies, including expertise location and employee-led innovation) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the next generation of information sharing and collaboration tools (e.g., Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing the topic with clients, even though one or more of the above reasons driving their need to formulate a social networking strategy, many decision-makers are simultaneously unsure of what value social networks will actually deliver to the business (e.g., ROI). Burton Group initiated a CR project on social networking within the enterprise to better understand the business, organizational and technology factors driving or blocking use of such solutions. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was the focus?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;To help sponsoring organizations understand what information was being sought, the CR project described four areas that would be inquired about when observing and listening to study participants share their perspectives on, or actual experiences with, social networks within the enterprise: &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Expertise location&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering “who knows what” (finding subject matter experts) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering “who knows whom” (finding someone with a relationship to a particular person or association with some organization) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Community-building and professional networking&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with peer groups (learning, story-telling) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Building relationships with colleagues &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Leveraging informal contacts &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment and retention &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Adapting to a new job, professional support, professional development, mentoring from current and prior employees &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Attracting new hires, tapping into experience of alumni and retirees &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Tooling &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Use of technologies to support social networking, knowledge management and talent management needs &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In my next post, I'll elaborate more on "how we did it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;An obvious first thought in my mind ... either (1) SharePoint cannot address the needs of this group or (2) it's not scalable/extensible enough or (3) it does not satisfy the emphasis on web standards or (4) Oxite is more of a one-off effort without a need to "eat your own dogfood" so to speak (align with other product group strategies, etc)... &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;Economic conditions are driving business and IT strategists to pursue options that will reduce and/or avoid costs. Web conferencing is one of those technologies that comes to the forefront of options decision makers often consider during hard times. Having covered the topic for over a decade, I've seen use of web conferencing grow incrementally over the years and then surge forward during a time of crisis (e.g., epidemics, acts of terrorism, economic downturns). However, once things return to "normal", the increased use of web conferencing within the enterprise tends to go down - not all the way back to its original level - but use does seem to recede once the crisis has passed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Why hasn't web conferencing taken off like e-mail and other communication and collaboration tools? &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly there are examples of specific applications where web conferencing has seen tremendous success: marketing webinars, virtual classrooms, and in certain custom service scenarios. But the technology is not nearly as mainstream in terms of everyday use by the vast majority of workers as email, the telephone and other tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to layout the top technology-related issues holding back web conferencing from becoming a broad-based, everyday solution, the following come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Poor usability (none of these tools are a joy to use by the average person) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Inflexible and/or complicated licensing models   &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Gaps in vendor capabilities - especially the level of  integration/interoperability across conferencing functions and media services (voice, video, and data) &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Note: This item would lead to a conversation on unified communications &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But technology per se if only part of the reason why web conferencing has not seen greater success. Even if we were to fix the above items, I'm not convinced it would lead to significant uptake in organizations for the the following reasons:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;People have pre-existing options to share information and collaborate (i.e., e-mail, face-to-face meetings, instant messaging, telephone, workspaces) &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Web conferencing introduces another tool and another choice people need to think about &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The positioning of web conferencing as a situational response to the crisis creates the perception that it is a temporary tactic &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Once restrictions and policies that promoted web conferencing (e.g., travel) are relaxed, people revert to old ways of working &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Changing people's behaviors and ways of working in a manner that is sustained over time brings us to the issue of "adoption vs. deployment".  Rather than stop after a web conferencing system is rolled out (as many organizations do with a variety of technologies), I would recommend some additional steps that focus on building and sustaining adoption over time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Make design and user experience a continuous post-deployment activity &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Customize the web conferencing system if possible and integrate the tool within existing applications where needed &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Observe and interview end-users on a regular basis and make adjustments to the system and supporting services (e.g., training, help desk) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Provide guidance on how different tools best satisfy different types of work activities &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Include examples beyond meetings and classrooms - outline where web conferencing is used "in flow" of a business activity  &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the guidelines practical so that people understand them (don't make them academic) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Pursue options that put a "community spotlight" on new ways of working &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Socialize how everyday work is being improved by having local advocates tell their stories in a visible manner &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Gain management sponsorship and buy-in to the notion that employees can co-create new work models that fit enterprise needs &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Consider supporting tools (e.g., a wiki, social network site) that allow end-users to share what works, what does not work, best practices, and gaps &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;I love the title "Reality Check 2.0" but all credit should go to Susan (citation link below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This recession/depression is poised to eclipse any downturn we’ve seen in our lifetimes. As I canvas the Enterprise 2.0 landscape, I find myself wondering: &lt;strong&gt;what is our killer economic crisis app/movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;? Will we save the U.S auto industry by social networking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Really? &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I can assure you, there will be no Federal bail outs for 2.0 startups. Some startups will stretch their life expectancy with VC funds, but at the end of the day, it’s show time. How will you help your customers and future customers grow or at least sustain their business through this economic downturn? &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.e2conf.com/"&gt;The Enterprise 2.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.e2conf.com/about/advisoryboard.php"&gt;Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; is convening in an online forum to discuss themes for this year’s conference. The conversation quickly migrated beyond the soft benefits of social collaboration to the hard, measurable benefits businesses need when navigating through tough times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://itsinsider.com/2008/11/24/reality-check-20/"&gt;ITSinsider » Blog Archive » Reality Check 2.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Susan generously quotes me in here blog post (copied below). The economic crisis will bring a level of sanity to the irrational exuberance associated with various catch-phrases (e.g., Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0,  social media, social networking, etc). The next 12-18 months will be time for "pragmatic due diligence" when it comes to social software. This emphasis on a realistic approach towards solutions driven by social software should not be an excuse for IT organizations to protect vendors they are comfortable with - this crisis could easily become a situation where IT groups leverage "cost reduction", "infrastructure overlap", and "integration complexity" as excuses to get rid of smaller vendors and retreat into comfort zones with platforms they identify with to a greater degree than the business areas they support. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I can already imagine lines like "we're reducing costs by getting rid of (insert E2.0 vendor here) because we've already paid for SharePoint and Microsoft promises that they will have a better (insert E2.0 component here re: blog, wiki, social networking) capability in the next release". Never mind that in the two years that this might be the case (and I stress the word "might"), you have to ask yourself - what business value will not have been realized by using bad tools instead of good tools? And by forcing bad tools on users - will we "poison the well" and make people less receptive to working differently based on a bad experience? Changing behaviors and getting people to alter their mindset concerning what tools to use has always been a huge barrier in the collaboration space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent post (&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/11/readers-corner-while-i-was-away.html"&gt;Reader's Corner&lt;/a&gt;), I identified a misplaced focus on platforms, suites and point solutions when it comes to social software re: "those are valid discussions at some point - but you need to think about the change you're trying to bring about (business-wise and in terms of organizational dynamics)." A rational and architectural approach towards reducing vendors is a credible tactic - defacto tossing them under the bus is not so credible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic due diligence means that in addition to a return-to-basics (see the quote below), we also need to have a more thorough understanding of how user experience and adoption scenarios influence success. Right now we tend to think in terms of "deployment" when it comes to social software. Assessing adoption is more critical and represents a type of ROI that is hard to determine - IT organizations usually follow a Plan-Build-Run framework that often means Plan-Build-Runaway after the system is deployed. But since many social applications are not transactional or process-specific in a traditional sense (they can augment such systems, or be used in their own unique way) - it means we need to establish methods around adoption practices to gauge how people really get work done and how work models change as a result of social applications (which relates back to "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_dilligence"&gt;due diligence - establishing a standard of care&lt;/a&gt;"). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe that the pendulum will swing so far to the other extreme that all projects involving blogs, wikis, social networks, etc. will be suspended or canceled outright. Those involved in such projects however need to pragmatically focus on some of the items listed below, become more specific in terms of what change the project will bring about, and be prepared for some realignment (e.g., of funding, resources, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the phrases I keep hearing: 1. Efficiency (cost containment/avoidance, streamlining, etc.) 2. Execution (all-things-lean, process refinement) 3. Effectiveness (process and people performance, measurable productivity) 4. Rationalization (of budgets, of projects, of platforms) 5. Governance and metrics to support the above. Operations (run the business) and investment to protect top/bottom line engines (grow the business) are still ok – transformation unless it maps into some of the above areas is more discretionary – a good strategist will not cut to the bone… but overall – it’s a run/grow the business more than transformation. Business transformation (at least in my head) is more than just changing a process. Anything “soft” is getting a hard look – sure – some savvy execs will keep a portfolio perspective and still invest in some long-term areas and not slash things to the point that when the economy rights itself they are strategically behind but they (1) may not have any choice and (2) may not get broad agreement from their peers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;They also need to think not in terms of plan - build - run but perhaps more along the lines of observe - design - adopt when it comes to social software.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;There have been several comments left on different blog posts that I have not been able to respond to of late. I thought I would summarize a few of them here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Enterprise 2.0 &amp;amp; The Economic Downturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan provides commentary on several other blog posts and analysts reports. A couple of things come to mind: (1) The issue is not about "Enterprise 2.0". The issue is really about how organizations approach aspects related to business-case formation, sponsorship, funding, ROI/metrics, and the decision-making related to rationalizing and prioritizing IT initiatives. Vendors (and analysts) caught up in a debate on whether suites and point tools will survive better or whether suites versus entrenched platforms will survive better should be looking higher up in the decision-making chain rather than in the technology nuances. IT organizations able to deliver solutions that focus on operational efficiencies (e.g., cost reduction/avoidance), revenue enhancement (e.g., retaining business, growing account value), and organizational effectiveness (e.g., process execution) are likely to be more well-received than backing solutions that are viewed as a discretionary spend or as something "nice to have" when times are good. (2) That said - savvy leadership teams realize that slash-and-burn approaches are going to leave them behind when markets do right themselves - yes, it's about survival but you need to survive-and-thrive afterwards. Organizations that continue to invest in specific initiatives that might be considered transformational in nature could very-well find themselves in a more competitive position over the long run my looking at the economic downturn as a signal to shift how it invests in IT (as a portfolio) but not to abandon all investments in certain areas related to collaboration (including social tools). But it still is not about suites vs. point tools or about suites vs. platforms. Those are valid discussions at some point - but you need to think about the change you're trying to bring about (business-wise and in terms of organizational dynamics).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle Continues: SharePoint and Connections vs. Enterprise 2.0 suites. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In a tough economic climate which coincides with broad acceptance of emerging "2.0" technology, it's becoming clear that this is the time when companies will choose to do more, with Enterprise 2.0 suites, for less. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction/permalink/Blog904"&gt;http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction/permalink/Blog904&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Software Short List&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner recently came out with its assessment of the social software market (&lt;a href="http://collaborate.jivesoftware.com/content/promo_reg_081031_gartner-magic-quadrant"&gt;view here&lt;/a&gt;). First, the short list I provided was based on a specific blog post reflective of my own research and interactions with clients so the list of endors listed should not be positioned as a market assessment. What makes a market assessment on social software so difficult is that (1) the space is incredibly large, (2) the space is comprised of many different sub-spaces so there is a great deal of technology diversity, (3) some sub-spaces are externally focused while others are more internally focused (e.g., intranet) so there is a great deal of solution diversity and (4) there are a large number of vendors (platforms, suites, point tools, open source, etc). I use the term "space" because you have to first define social software and agree that social software is a market. I do not have access to the report so I will leave that issue to those that have read it - but I think the effort would have been better served by breaking the topic down a bit. I just don't find it useful (and I don't mean to be negative from a competitive perspective) - when I look at it and try to let it speak for itself - I'm not sure what it's trying to say. Some of these vendors focus on social media (external solution) and have pulled themselves out of RFPs for intranet solutions. It seems like community vendors are represented but perhaps better served with a specific graphic - it's hard to figure out how to compare/contrast community vendors with point tools. Some vendors are platform vendors so yes, they have strong impact as a collaboration/content solution but their blog and wiki tools are pretty bad (e.g., Microsoft) or have components completely missing (e.g., IBM Lotus Connections does not have a native wiki). I can't see on the graphic where NewsGator is (or is not) so does that mean that feeds are not social software (which gets back to definition and market structure issues). I think it is just very difficult, if next-to-impossible, to plot social software vendors on a two dimensional graph, even if you can get by the debate as to whether social software is a market per se rather than a category of software within which multiple markets reside. My own take-away is that social software is a composite market (if it is a market) and best assessed by multiple graphics rather than a "mashup" approach. It's just really really hard to do this type of market segmentation and have it be useful for people when it includes so many different sub-categories - you end up with potpourri (a decorative mix) rather than something that might be practical for decision-makers. &#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Bagaba, On Post &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/site/blogs/6a00d834515a5969e200d8341bf9a053ef/post/6a00d834515a5969e200e54f124bda8834/edit"&gt;Social Networking (?) With Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to know how you came up with your short list. I see SO many vendors on the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant lumped closely together and I shudder to think what that list will look like in 2 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Social Presence &amp;amp; Social Awareness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend reading "&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/more-thoughts-o.html"&gt;More Thoughts On Social Presence&lt;/a&gt;" which has links to some other posts on this topic. I do believe that a feed syndication platform forms the core of this approach and that a combination of Atom/AtomPub, XMPP, and microformats will also have a critical role. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;When you said "we want to consolidate all into one flow -- a single time-stamped thread -- that all apps can dip into" did you have any specific process in mind about how this would work, i.e. service, platform or system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;Since my last update (&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/10/project-status-social-networking-within-the-enterprise.html"&gt;October 28&lt;/a&gt;), my field research project has completed its most labor intensive phase. Phase 1 (Call For Participation) took about a month elapsed time (August 15 thru September 15). The focus of Phase 1 was to layout the project scope, construct the contextual research framework and finalize the list of participating organizations. Phase 2 (Interviews &amp;amp; Consolidation) took longer - about two months (September 15 through November 20). During that time I was on the road for around 40 days. The focus of Phase 2 was pretty labor intensive (refer to my &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/10/project-status-social-networking-within-the-enterprise.html"&gt;prior update&lt;/a&gt; for some stats). Each interview session lasted an average of 90 minutes and produced a long set of handwritten notes (usually between 10-15 pages). After each interview session, an internal "interpretation session" with other analysts resulted in an "affinity statement" that summarized key points and finding from the interview. Affinity statements seemed to average around 60 line items. Phase 2 culminated with a "consolidation session" last week in Chicago which included 4 other analysts. For the consolidation session, each affinity statement is broken down into an individual line item as a "post-it note". While the complete affinity statement reflects the perspective of a single organization, during the consolidation session we are looking for horizontal patterns across all the individual data points regardless of organization. Breaking the affinity statements down into individual items allowed us to do a bottom-up sorting of the information into clusters that we could then organize into categories. These categories could then be further abstracted into a narrative of what is going on within organizations concerning social networks. The result was a wall covered with 35-40 sheets of flip chart paper with the 1700 post-it notes taped down into a hierarchy of sorts. The approach we applied (based on contextual design/inquiry) really does enable you to find commonalities across organizations and identify unique insights by letting the data "speak for itself". &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 3 should be more normal (in terms of time, labor, etc). Phase 3 involves deeper analysts of the information in order to write a research document. Originally I thought that the project would result in the normal 50 page Burton Group report. What we discovered is that we have so much data that a single document cannot address all the areas touched upon by participating organizations. Instead, I'll be writing a series of shorter documents (around 15 pages each) that will follow the storyline we created during the consolidation session last week. For those organizations that participated - there's no change - you will receive the "report" (whether you are a client or not) as a set rather than a single file, and you will still have the opportunity to discuss the findings as originally promised. It's just an incredible amount of data to wade through and I don't want to reduce the value of the information by arbitrarily cutting it short (in terms of a single report).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, the flip chart pages with the post-it notes are on their way to my home office. Once I get them up on the walls here (to the joy of my family who might not appreciate the new wallpaper downstairs in our cellar), I'll pass along some additional insight. Unfortunately, in order to meet my deliverable deadlines I've had to pass on attending Cisco's C-Scape (December) and IBM's Lotusphere (January) events. This has been an exhausting journey but I should be getting back to a more normal routine over the next few weeks - including posting on a more regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Oracle announced that it has acquired the intellectual property assets of Tacit Software. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Tacit Software’s unique automated profiling technology is an expertise location solution that helps organizations uncover new opportunities for collaboration. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle plans to integrate Tacit Software into Oracle Beehive, a secure, integrated, standards-based enterprise collaboration platform. &#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The combined solution is expected to enable enterprises to make effective and immediate use of the knowledge present in their people, messaging and content. &#xD;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;A lot has gone on since my last update in &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/project-statu-1.html"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;. My workload has been incredible over the past few months (September/October) and will continue that way until mid-November when I wrap up the data gathering and consolidation phase of this field research effort. On top of all the travel needed to conduct 1/3 of these interview sessions in a face-to-face manner, I attended a couple of vendor events (Oracle and Cisco) and presented at our Catalyst conference last week in Prague. So my life has been more than a little hectic. But - I wanted to share some info on the project's progression. As it stands now:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The number of organizations participating stands at 22 &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The number of interview sessions look like it will end up being 33 &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The number of hours spent listening to people "tell their story" regarding social networks is about 50 hours &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;About 1/3 of these interviews have been face-to-face sessions &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;About 15 or these sessions have been with non-IT groups (line-of-business management, HR management, corporate communications, etc) &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The remaining sessions have been with representatives from IT organizations &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Each session seems to produce 10-15 pages of hand-written notes &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The hand-written notes are interpreted in a group session to produce "affinity statements" &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The number of affinity statements seems to run around 70 per session &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The consolidation phase will have over 2000 affinity statements to filter / sort / categorize / etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This project has been very demanding (consuming virtually all of my attention that past few months) but the insight has been incredibly unique and much different than any other research method I've applied over the years since I've been an analyst (1996). The interview sessions will close out the end of next week (11/7) and be followed by the consolidation session in mid-November where our team will "let the data speak to us". After that event, the process becomes more normal - an analysis review session for my proposed document(s) and a deliverable due end of January (actual publishing will depend on the overall production schedule).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in late November I should be back to a more normal blogging pattern....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&#xD;
&lt;h6&gt;Abstract&lt;/h6&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The central role of "platform" products and services in mediating the activities of disaggregated "clusters" or "ecosystems" of firms has been widely recognized. But platforms and the systems in which they are embedded are very diverse. In particular, platforms may exist within firms as product lines, across firms as multi-product systems, and in the form of multi-sided markets. In this paper we argue that there is a fundamental unity in the architecture of platforms. Platform architectures are modularizations of complex systems in which certain components (the platform itself) remain stable, while others (the complements) are encouraged to vary in cross section or over time. Among the most stable elements in a platform architecture are the modular interfaces that mediate between the platform and its complements. These interfaces are even more stable than the interior core of the platform, thus control over the interfaces amounts to control over the platform and its evolution. We describe three ways of representing platform architectures: network graphs, design structure matrices and layer maps. We conclude by addressing a number of fundamental strategic questions suggested by a unified view of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6025.html"&gt;The Architecture of Platforms: A Unified View — HBS Working Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;A concise and very effective set of guidelines from &lt;a href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/whoweare.php"&gt;David Snowden&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowledge can only be volunteered it cannot be conscripted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You can’t make someone share their knowledge, because you can never measure if they have. You can measure information transfer or process compliance, but you can’t determine if a senior partner has truly passed on all their experience or knowledge of a case. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We only know what we know when we need to know it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Human knowledge is deeply contextual and requires stimulus for recall. Unlike computers we do not have a list-all function. Small verbal or nonverbal clues can provide those ah-ha moments when a memory or series of memories are suddenly recalled, in context to enable us to act. When we sleep on things we are engaged in a complex organic form of knowledge recall and creation; in contrast a computer would need to be rebooted. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the context of real need few people will withhold their knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A genuine request for help is not often refused unless there is literally no time or a previous history of distrust. On the other hand ask people to codify all that they know in advance of a contextual enquiry and it will be refused (in practice its impossible anyway). Linking and connecting people is more important than storing their artifacts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything is fragmented&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We evolved to handle unstructured fragmented fine granularity information objects, not highly structured documents. People will spend hours on the internet, or in casual conversation without any incentive or pressure. However creating and using structured documents requires considerably more effort and time. Our brains evolved to handle fragmented patterns not information. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tolerated failure imprints learning better than success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When my young son burnt his finger on a match he learnt more about the dangers of fire than any amount of parental instruction cold provide. All human cultures have developed forms that allow stories of failure to spread without attribution of blame. Avoidance of failure has greater evolutionary advantage than imitation of success. It follows that attempting to impose best practice systems is flying in the face of over a hundred thousand years of evolution that says it is a bad thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The way we know things is not the way we report we know things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There is an increasing body of research data which indicates that in the practice of knowledge people use heuristics, past pattern matching and extrapolation to make decisions, coupled with complex blending of ideas and experiences that takes place in nanoseconds. Asked to describe how they made a decision after the event they will tend to provide a more structured process oriented approach which does not match reality. This has major consequences for knowledge management practice. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We always know more than we can say, and we will always say more than we can write down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is probably the most important. The process of taking things from our heads, to our mouths (speaking it) to our hands (writing it down) involves loss of content and context. It is always less than it could have been as it is increasingly codified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2008/10/rendering_knowledge.php"&gt;Cognitive Edge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Timely - we just published a reference architecture template on social network sites so if you are a Burton Group client, check out the document &lt;a href="http://www.burtongroup.com/Client/Research/Document.aspx?cid=1482"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (note: client access required). I'll cover some of the basics in the report during the webinar today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;IT Best Practices for Enterprise Social Networking – Burton Group Webinar&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;h5&gt;Free Live Webinar – September 30, 2008 at 2 pm ET&lt;/h5&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of consumer sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace, and Bebo, IT professionals are facing an increased demand to review and implement social networking capabilities for their enterprise. There are numerous technical and functional items that need to be taken into consideration when developing an enterprise social network. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since social networking for the enterprise is relatively new, best practices and feature/function requirements are not clearly established or widely available. Based on his extensive social computing experience, Mike Gotta has established a common set of infrastructure architectural components and capabilities that IT should consider when implementing an enterprise social network site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Join Burton Group and NewsGator for a live webinar on September 30, 2008 at 2 pm ET that will cover: &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A definition of enterprise social networks &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the key infrastructure components of social networks &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;A demonstration of how to implement enterprise social networks with Microsoft SharePoint &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com/enterprise20/Sept2008/IT-Best-Practices-Enterprise-Burton.aspx?LeadSource=Blog"&gt;IT Best Practices for Enterprise Social Networking – Burton Group Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;Recommendation: People should be examining Cisco's announcements this week more broadly that just a SaaS Collaboration/Web 2.0 play and/or as an update on its UC/video/telepresence efforts. The evolving puzzle pieces will lead to an maturing SaaS, PaaS (Platform as a Service), and Cloud play. Compare/contrast Cisco with those trends in the market. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WebEx Connect will need a strong IdM (Identity Management) play and will do so either through expanding what exists within PostPath or through an acquisition or a deep partnership. This will be a "cloud based" IdM play - not on-premise (to which it would federate with existing solutions). The cloud-based identity service will be key to expand on social networking aspects that will emerge around WebEx Connect.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;More acquisitions - perhaps one of the mashup, or PaaS, or feed syndication platform vendors or a mobile player.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;More partnerships - perhaps with Jive or other white label/hosted social/community platforms vendors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Below are a random collection of questions in my head as I sit and listen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;DoJo Questions (Disclaimer: I don't cover Ajax/widgets per se so these questions are based on little knowledge and might be offbase or not relevant)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is Cisco's position on OpenAjax Alliance?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Where will Cisco go concerning OpenAjax Metadata specification?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Where will Cisco go concerning OpenAjax Hub (secure mashup runtime)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What about offline - does WebEx Connect implement Dojo Offline which is based on Google Gears?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will Cisco deploy any Dojo widgets on top of Adobe AIR?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will Cisco join the DoJo Foundation and participate/contribution to the community?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What's the open source licensing direction (GPL, BSD, etc)? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Managing the widgets built by third parties running on the platform - terms of service, gallery/store, etc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Tooling&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wiki was mentioned but not the provider - open source or OEM?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will there be a blog capability forthcoming?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Other social software tools such as tags/bookmarks, social networking, etc?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity tools? Will we see a ZoHo or someone else jump on the platform? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Other SaaS players - will others move from their own hosted solution to Cisco to gain network effects? Maybe the hosted version of Jive Clearspace?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will there be a UM story (Unity in the cloud)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Workflow story?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Content Management&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WebEx Connect includes document sharing but how far will it support lifecycle functions (check-in/out, version contorl, archival, records management)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will Cisco jump on the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) effort?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Discovery angles - organizations need to have confidence that they can react to various e-discovery demands - how supported by this platform?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What are the records management functions for content, email, IM, etc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;XML Feeds&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exposing RSS/Atom feeds is one thing but will Cisco include a feed syndication platform within WebEx Connection (ala Attensa, NewsGator)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will Atom Pub be supported within the underling application/platform services?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Synergies between XMPP/Jabber and Atom/AtomPub for applications and syndication of operational data form back-end systems?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Integration&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will SharePoint integration include Web Parts (similar to what Awareness has done with its SaaS solution)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What about portlets for integrating WebEx Connect with other portal platforms?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What about integration with Lotus Connections, Lotus Notes/Domino, Lotus Quickr? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Support for OpenSocial? Microformats (e.g., hCard, XFN)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Presence/IM federation - where's the gateway story for interop with AOL, Yahoo!, etc?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will there be a workflow capability (even if lightweight)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Development test environment - how supported? Organizations will want a sandbox before deployment?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Web services mentioned a lot - but what type of web services? Soap? Others?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Social Networking &amp;amp; Identity&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given the talk on profiles and social networking - where is the identity management direction? What about OpenID/OpenAuth?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Do rCards or XRI come into play over the long run?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What's the profile unification direction - how many profiles will Cisco be delivering within/across different products?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will Cisco emulate the approach taken by Sun Project OpenSocial or Ringside Network to add WebEx Connect capabilities to be embedded within existing web properties that are not running on Cisco's platform (e.g., widget syndication)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Will there be a layer of analytical services that correlates and infers relationship connections based on e-mail, contacts, etc (similar to IBM Atlas or Contact Networks)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco eventually needs an Identity Management solution. Does Cisco acquire its way into IdM or partner?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud / PaaS / SaaS Ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the business model for third parties to build solutions on WebEx Connect from both a technical solution provider and an application/business solution provider?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Why should people consider Cisco as a cloud player? How does Cisco define its cloud (assumption: cloud does not equal WebEx Connet)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Can other parties build solutions on the cloud without being involved with WebEx Connect?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Does Cisco see SaaS as equal to WebEx Connect? If not, what other SaaS solutions will be placed on the underling Media Tone Network?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy for interoperability with on-premise systems (software and software as a service)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Given the application lifecycle management capabilities - does this put Cisco into the PaaS arena (Platform as a Service)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;What type of marketplaces with this solution support for partners to open up their own "shops"?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Terms of service will be critical in terms of stewardship - what are the licensing terms for widgets - TOS for users and partners, will there be a way to disable or delete widgets (refer to recent Ning and Facebook issues) ... &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco seems to be evolving to compete with the likes of Google? Microsoft Windows Live? SalesForce? Others?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Implications from a go-to-market / channel / sales / brand perspective on getting people comfortable with the transformation into collaboration and Web 2.0 ... but this appears to be a 3-5 year journey so what's the roadmap, how is success defined, benchmarks along the way, training/support for partner transition etc?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Deeper partnerships needed in the professional services space - or does Cisco need its own professional services arm?&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Developer community - key to energizing WebEx Connect - what's the application developer community program to compete with what IBM, Microsoft and Oracle had to attract/retain a loyal developer community?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;Rough notes taken during this morning's presentation on WebEx Connect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does IT meet the competing demands from end users where end users can obtain solutions from the consumer market with updates to tools occurring at a much faster rate than traditional enterprise IT software.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Need a new architecture and approach. Want to support a 3-6 month delivery cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;But, need to maintain security, compliance, and other policies&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco Collaboration Architecture: higher level of services (presence, messaging), designed for other people to extend (mashups), designed for enterprise environment (policy management)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Unified Communications + Web 2.0 + SaaS supported by a network services layer linked to API strategy (based on web services) and Cisco developer services program, etc&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage Cisco network expertise (Cisco Intelligent Network)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;WebEx Media Tone Network&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9 globally linked data center, 99.99 reliability, hot site redundancy, peering with BGP, audit against ISO-17799 and SAS70 Type II standards&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligent, secure, reliable, and scalable global delivery&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;125K WebEx sessions per day across 94 days&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Operational Support System: software deployment, site/resource provisioning, usage monitoring, network performance, etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;WebEx Connect Collaboration Services&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;e-Mail&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Presence&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Instant Messaging&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Shared Workspaces&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Voice&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Video&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Web meetings (conferencing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Development &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Platform APIs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Unified user experience, single client&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco focused on a communication-centric user experience, existing tools (IBM, Microsoft) are more document centric or file centric and historically, asynchoronous&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Client interface has elements of social networking, profiles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Team spaces have group discussion forums, persistent chat, document sharing and widgets (note: not sure whether document sharing implied document library with version controls, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Widgets: calendar, task, bulletin board, but can create customized widgets&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Customize team spaces for business processes (can be customized by business partners so a business model here), development platform and open APIs, add collaboration to a process, create simple mashups&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Platform is hosted on Media Tone Network&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Application development framework API, Connect Platform Services API, security framework, common services, application services, administration services, all exposed via REST and web services interfaces&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;PostPath provides e-mail and calendaring&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Jabber provides presence and real-time messaging&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;See Jabber beyond IM - but messaging platform - not just people-to-people but for application systems as well (alerting/notifications)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;SAML supported, directory integration, full policy management framework (user, groups, roles), centralized management at workspace level, audit and logging and network-based policy enforcement; policies apply to IM, file transfer, meetings, video, voice, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Policies follow users wherever they go on the network, separation of policy and access controls&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Policy framework supports policy alignment across companies if multi-company collaboration environment setup&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;WebEx Connet Application Framework base don Ajax, Dojo Open Source Project, declarative style definition language defined, MVC model, reuse of components supported&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Declarative language called AppConstruct so you can build composite applications, XML format&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;AppConstruct enables application life-cycle management supported, supports provisioning and policy controls (e.g., who has access to what widgets)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Platform components designed to be "mashed up" with other applications/platforms, as well as within its own WebEx Connect platform. No need to always use WebEx Connect user experience or unified client. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft integration: with Outlook/Exchange (e.g., Calendar), access Outlook e-mails from the WebEx Connect client (e.g., "recent emails), add add WebEx presence to Microsoft Outlook, you can also upload, view, edit directly from SharePoint&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Also integrated with on-premise communications such as Call Manager (leverage CUCM architecture, dial plan, VoIP and toll bypass)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Widgets for call history, voice messaging, etc. WebEx Connect will become a native UC client (softphone for voice and video)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: platform approach, collaboration outside/inside the firewall, cross-company collaboration, support multiple user experiences and cloud-based economics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IBM Sametime integration supported - can also access documents within IBM environment, have not done some of the client integration (Outlook) with Notes for e-mail and calendar&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;No requirement on IDE's ... programmers can leverage existing development environments&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investing around $3B in research-related activities; 1200 patents &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;50 acquisitions over last 5 years; 1 out of every 3 employees are non-Oracle (prior to expansion) - went from 40K to 85K employees &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;3 basic businesses: database, middleware and packaged applications (CRM, ERP, Financial, HR, etc) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;25% growth over last years, stock up 18% &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Theme: Complete - Open - Integrated &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Packaged Applications &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horizontal (ERP and CRM) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical (Industry specific - automotive, chemicals, CPG, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Application Integration Architecture (AIA) &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrate any application, Oracle and non-Oracle leveraging standard middleware, pre-built standard integration &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Formalize integration methods, "packaged integration" similar in concept to packaged applications &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comment: data/object models at all levels (people, business, technology), meta data and meta models are likely key for this framework&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comment: Standards are not always available for all types of integration so challenge of leading standards effort or moving ahead in a way that remains open (will be especially true for emerging areas related to social networking)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bold move by Cisco (given it's commitment to SIP) to expand industry thinking around presence as well as expanding its thinking around real-time applications given the type of development capabilities made possible with XMPP.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So suddenly, I see both Avaya and Cisco as the new thought-leaders when it comes to presence &lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;(especially in regards to &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/more-thoughts-o.html"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;social presence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;&amp;quot;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and IBM are locked into yesterday's view of presence and where it needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: What will Avaya do since they OEM'd their XMPP capability based on Jabber's platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution will show up first in the WebEx world (e.g., Media Tone Network, WebEx Connect) and then follow with an on-premise implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federation will emerge as well between the cloud/SaaS world and on-premise implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given XMPP's use within the government and financial sectors, this move will also help Cisco expand its customer relationships with those organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;(added after original post) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;Involvement with the &lt;a href="http://www.xmpp.org/"&gt;XMPP Standards Foundation&lt;/a&gt; will provide Cisco with opportunities to grow the community and partner ecosystem interested in XMPP from both an open source and open standards perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;XMPP support will also help interoperability with Google as well as with other vendor's in the collaboration and social software space that leverage XMPP (i.e., Jive Software, Twitter).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;Overall, the move continues to help Cisco build-out a platform and ecosystem for both its UC and evolving collaboration/Web 2.0 efforts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, CA -- 09/19/08 -- Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) today announced its intent to acquire privately held Jabber, Inc., a provider of presence and messaging software. Based in Denver, Jabber will work with Cisco to enhance the existing presence and messaging functions of Cisco's Collaboration portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition will enable Cisco to embed presence and messaging services &amp;quot;in the network&amp;quot; and provide rich aggregation capabilities to users through both on-premise and on-demand solutions, across multiple platforms including Cisco WebEx® Connect and Cisco Unified Communications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enterprise organizations want an extensible presence and messaging platform that can integrate with business process applications and easily adapt to their changing needs,&amp;quot; said Doug Dennerline, Cisco senior vice president, Collaboration Software Group. &amp;quot;With the acquisition of Jabber, we will be able to extend the reach of our current instant messaging service and expand the capabilities of our collaboration platform. Our intention is to be the interoperability benchmark in the collaboration space.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jabber provides a carrier-grade, best-in-class presence and messaging platform. Jabber's technology leverages open standards to provide a highly scalable architecture that supports the aggregation of presence information across different devices, users and applications. The technology also enables collaboration across many different presence systems such as Microsoft Office Communications Server, IBM Sametime, AOL AIM, Google and Yahoo!. Jabber's platform leads the market in system robustness, scalability, extensibility and global distribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jabber acquisition exemplifies Cisco's &amp;quot;build, buy and partner&amp;quot; innovation strategy to move quickly into new markets and capture key market transitions. In addition to internal software innovations, Cisco actively employs investments in, and acquisitions of, other companies to support its software strategy; recent purchases include industry leaders WebEx, IronPort, Securent and PostPath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transaction will be accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Financial terms of the transaction are undisclosed. The acquisition is subject to various standard closing conditions and is expected to be complete in Cisco's first half of fiscal year 2009. Upon completion of the acquisition, Jabber employees will become part of the Cisco Collaboration Software Group (CSG). CSG is part of the recently established Software Group, consisting of Cisco's major software businesses; including the IOS network operating system, network and service management, Unified Communications solutions, policy management, and SaaS offerings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two notable comments to my earlier &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/presence-is-too.html#comments"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://ccsblog.burtongroup.com/collaboration_and_content/2008/09/presence-is-too.html#comments"&gt;cross-post&lt;/a&gt;) on the concept of social presence and the role (or non-role) of UC vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blair brings up a direct concern (security) and an indirect concern (surveillance). Both are credible issues. Any social presence platform would clearly need to include a policy management component that would integrate with security and identity management systems within an enterprise to support authentication, authorization and related demands (e.g. logging, audit, archival, and records management). An enterprise would require the capability to impose certain policies on a social presence platform to satisfy governance, risk, compliance or other demands. Additionally, any such system would have to have a permission model with access controls that enable people to manage their own “presence”. But I don’t see this as any more of a roadblock than what we expect from other tools – not just those related to UC but also those related to social software in general (e.g., e-mail, calendar, blog and wiki platforms). So while a valid comment, it applies equally to existing tools almost universally. In fact, I point out the need for such functionality in a recent most on &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/microblogging-i.html"&gt;microblogging within the enterprise&lt;/a&gt;. To be clear – yes – any social presence platform will need to be secure, integrate with existing infrastructure, and support some type of federation model for interoperability with the external world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inferred point regarding surveillance is more interesting and properly points out the social dynamics involved as we share “lifestreams” of information about ourselves as we go about our activities. In a blog entry posted in April of this year (&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/04/participatory-s.html"&gt;Participatory Surveillance: Co-mingling Intimacy &amp;amp; Exposure&lt;/a&gt;), there are pro and con arguments that are equally valid concerning how people interact in a mediated public space. Some people will feel very comfortable while others will become rather nervous as they are “followed” by people they may not know – even if they are other employees. Such a concern reinforces the need for controls that allow users to limit their visibility, to filter what they share or to even block someone from tracking them. But – other people and groups may find such capabilities quite valuable in terms of improving shared situational awareness and enabling people to self-synchronize with the conversations or activities of others. There’s no right or wrong – just the need for a social presence platform to include controls that each person can customize how much or how little they wish to expose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point regarding “business presence” vs. “social presence” I believe is more of a contrived debate. The term “social” is often inappropriately equated to “play” or to “waste of time”. Organizations will tell me “we’re pursuing corporate social networking” or “we prefer to user the term ‘professional networking’ rather than social networking”. I don’t mind if people want to label something differently but to a great extent “it is what it is – no matter what we call it”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is “business presence”? Are we going to limit presence only to the meta-data status of someone (on the phone, in a meeting, etc)? Is business presence going to be limited to some set of formal states? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are &amp;quot;corporate/professional networks&amp;quot;? Relationships are hugely influenced by underlying social constructs. Our desire to understand the social aspects of how work gets done and how people leverage informal connections has been a long-sough goal of those involved in knowledge management, organizational development, learning and other initiatives related to community-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should drop the notion that there are not social aspects to business. Artificial labels are necessary at times (i.e., business presence, corporate or professional networking). However we should acknowledge that work is a social environment and we need to catalyze those social dynamics to support business strategies that help drive growth and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ccsblog.burtongroup.com/collaboration_and_content/2008/09/presence-is-too.html#comments"&gt;Comment from earlier cross-post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I totally agree with you and I agree that social networking and UC and presence are all tied in together (I love your term social presence). I do have a concern about mixing social presence with business presence. Do I want my calendar information and status information available to someone who follows me because they want to hear what I have to say about UC, for example? And security can be an issue as well - people can know when I'm out of the country on a family vacation, meaning there's no one home guarding the house, except my cute little dog which they can see pictures of on my social networking sites. So I agree with the concept, but feel that it will require lots of rules, permissions, security settings, etc. that we have to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blair Pleasant &lt;br /&gt;President and Principal Analyst, COMMfusion LLC Co-Founder, &lt;a href="http://www.commfusion.com/about.aspx"&gt;UCStrategies.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave felt that I was perhaps too hard on UC vendors. I disagree. Clearly federation is a challenge - especially intranet federation. And yes, we can move the food around on the plate and do a better job with the current presence model. But the bigger problem is &amp;quot;that vision thing&amp;quot;. Once large vendors get to a point where they have a product in the market for some time (IBM), or are building a product that targets a given market that they have long sought to enter (Microsoft), there is reluctance to push the reset button and take a fresh approach if that approach impacts the existing product. UC-presence will continue down its current trajectory (remember, I'm not saying that UC-presence is not valuable - just that it is limited and can only be advanced so far). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other vendors (Cisco, Jabber) also seem entrenched in this narrow view of &amp;quot;presence&amp;quot;. If a vendor wanted to disrupt the status-quo, I would imagine that delivering a social presence platform might be an interesting way to open up new dialogs with business and IT decision makers and get some media attention as well. It will be interesting to see if a project associated with SAP (called &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://blog.esme.us/"&gt;ESME&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, which stands for &amp;quot;Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment&amp;quot;) gains traction in this regard.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What UC vendors should find the strength to admit (and Avaya is the first one to arrive at this point) is: (1) presence is much broader than how UC has defined it, (2) presence needs to be an independent capability with open interfaces to a variety of different applications, (3) SIMPLE has become an inappropriate standard for the next generation of presence, and (4) social networking trends are foreshadowing where presence needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect IBM and Microsoft are going to protect their current investments, will try to position &amp;quot;rich presence&amp;quot; as defined within the UC world as actually being &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; and come up with tactical ways to bridge it to social networking trends. Right now, neither is offering a &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot; of presence beyond the products they wish to sell. I expect Microsoft to continue to limit integration and interoperability of its proprietary &amp;quot;rich presence&amp;quot; services with other vendors. IBM will play better with others - but it's still about Sametime and not a step towards social presence as I see it evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would hope that UC vendors are getting ideas from folks like &lt;a href="http://www.attensa.com/"&gt;Attensa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com/"&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.rssbus.com/"&gt;RSSBus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.gnipcentral.com/"&gt;Gnip&lt;/a&gt;; leveraging work being done at &lt;a href="https://rome.dev.java.net/"&gt;Project Rome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/abdera/"&gt;Apache Abdera&lt;/a&gt; - and learning how to exploit microformats as well. These are some of the core elements I feel are necessary to deliver a social presence platform that works with existing UC platforms but is not tied down by the presence baggage of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/presence-is-too.html"&gt;Comment from earlier post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent points! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you were a tad too hard on UC vendors for doin' a what comes natural in using UC-centric presence models. Application-specific presence isn't the cardinal sin - lack of (presence and other) federation is the real problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence information is valuable and adding custom presence states that are appropriate for specific applications can add great value to a solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for UC applications, it might be useful to have presence states that differentiate between speaking on the phone handset versus the speaker. This distinction is useful because more care must be taken speaking on a call that is being broadcast over a speaker. But if this custom presence state doesn't follow open standards and can't be published to other systems, its utility becomes vanishingly small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is gauche to design closed-system communications offerings (and social networking services, collaboration applications, etc.) which can only work for people within the walled garden system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once enough of the market understands how useful presence is, systems with non-standard, unfederated presence models will have to get with the program, or be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last update on my contextual research study was on &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/project-status.html"&gt;September 2nd&lt;/a&gt; so I thought it might be a good time to provide an update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The call-for-participation has been received by 70 companies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A range of industry sectors are represented within that group of 70 including: financial services, retail/speciality/services, pharmaceutical,&amp;nbsp; home improvement, legal, consumer products, insurance, manufacturing, travel, professional services, education, government, media, CPG, energy, telecommunications, and technology.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;As of today, 21 organizations have confirmed participation, 9 have expressed strong interest, 5 have declined, a few are wondering whether they are a “good fit” and the rest are routing the request around internally to find the right contact/decision maker or have not replied. &lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;Within the confirmed organizations, the financial services sector leads with 4 companies. There are four organizations represented within a combined retail/speciality/services category. Pharma and professional services are next with each sector represented by 3 organizations.&lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;The target study size is 20-25 organizations. I’m realistically waiting on about 9-12 organizations that have expressed strong interest or were recently invited to participate to keep with the original study size goal. &lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;I am not looking for additional participants at this time until the current queue of possible participants clears itself out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the next several weeks, things get just a little more hectic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two interview sessions are scheduled for the week of 9/15 (phone) while I am working on 2-4 onsite interviews possibly next week as well that are reasonably local to me. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Then it’s off to Oracle’s conference and Cisco’s analyst event the week of 9/22. &lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;Followed by a trip to Toronto the week of 9/29 for three onsite sessions.&lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;Followed by a trip to Atlanta the week of 10/6 for at least 2, no more than 4, onsite sessions. &lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;The week of 10/13 is open for telephone sessions and local onsite interviews. (I might actually be home… nahhhh)&lt;/li&gt;





&lt;li&gt;Then it’s off to Burton Group’s Catalyst event in Prague the week of 10/20.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whew … &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/">&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable that Twitter-like services would emerge targeting a business audience. While the term “microblogging” is frequently used to describe these platforms, they could also be considered as a derivative of group chat and instant messaging platforms as well. Within the enterprise, it is highly probable that IT organizations will classify these tools as messaging platforms (I would BTW). As a messaging platform, these tools would have to support security, logging, audit and archival functions to satisfy regulatory, compliance and records management demands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;These requirements might “ruin the party” about how people foresee microblogging taking off within the enterprise – but better to plan for such features now, and push vendors to deliver those functions, than ignore some basic blocking-and-tackling issues that inhibited rollout of enterprise instant messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the other debate that will go on internally within enterprise organizations will be the overlap between microblogging tools and instant messaging tools that support group chat. Will existing instant messaging vendors (i.e., IBM and Microsoft) support Twitter-like capabilities as an extension of their existing UC platforms – or – will there be a sustainable market opportunity for new entrants to deliver such messaging tools to an enterprise audience?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired Parlano some time ago which could be extended to be a “Twitter for the enterprise”. IBM’s Sametime already has large-scale broadcast and group chat capabilities as well. But, as my &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/presence-is-too.html"&gt;earlier post on social presence&lt;/a&gt; outlined – will UC vendors/product teams (who seem to have a narrow view of the world when it comes to social networking), expand their platforms (e.g., beyond SIP/SIMPLE) to support concepts related to social presence as well as concepts related to microblogging? Or will they continue to prioritize their own products as the be-all-end-all hub for these types of applications?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Myriad of Microblogging Options…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The media event, which ended Wednesday night in San Francisco, has ironically been very high profile on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the platform famous for originating ‘ambient intimacy’, Other microblogging platforms with traction amongst users include &lt;a href="http://www.plurk.com/"&gt;Plurk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pownce.com/"&gt;Pownce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://indenti.ca/"&gt;indenti.ca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.jaiku.com/"&gt;Jaiku&lt;/a&gt;, with more options popping up practically daily. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://15s.viddler.com/"&gt;…..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;ESME is interesting because it focuses on real world application of Twitter style functionality in the SAP ecosphere. From early feedback the Vegas SAP TEchEd crowd didn’t go wild over this innovative project unlike Yammer’s reception in San Francisco, the reality is most internal enterprise people don’t understand the utility of this type of communication yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer has a business model that allows rapid uptake of their service, which is anchored around urls. So if your company is arracanis.com for example those with @arracanis.com email addresses can join Yammer. If the owners of arracanis.com want any centralized control over this social network talking about their business they need to pay Yammer…&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;…..&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger challenge – completely understood by early business Twitter adopters such as @zappos - is making a standardized micro blogging platform as intuitive to use as email or the telephone for business users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;For smaller ad hoc business uptake Twitter, Yammer and other services will fill a gap, but there is still a need for a secure internal service that will carry sensitive communication. The ESME’s of the world are working towards that, and it’s a communication and training battle…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/collaboration/?p=140"&gt;A Myriad of Microblogging Options… | Collaboration 2.0 | ZDNet.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of this post might seem to be self-contradictory. After all, we associate presence as a foundational capability within unified communications. Indeed, several blog posts have recently highlighted the importance of presence as a core component of a UC platform while noting interoperability challenges across UC systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nojitter.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208400094&amp;amp;pgno=4&amp;amp;queryText="&gt;Interoperability in IP Telephony and Unified Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, companies worry about different vendors' PBXs talking to phones and to each other, as well as to applications such as contact centers. But the major bone of contention going forward into UC is presence and the need to &amp;quot;federate&amp;quot; presence engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nojitter.com/blog/archives/2008/07/presence_not_vo.html"&gt;Presence, not VoIP is the Foundation of Unified Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe this was conventional thinking for quite some time but this “old school” thinking needs to stop or UC will take years to reach its potential. Also, it’s just flat out wrong. Presence, not VoIP, should be thought of as the foundation for UC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ucstrategies.com/unified-communications-strategies-views/presence-plays-a-part-in-unified-communications.aspx"&gt;Presence Plays a Part in Unified Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the nojitter site recently, a couple of my fellow analysts wrote some interesting pieces about the role of presence. I completely concur with their assessments that presence is the foundation of UC. In fact, I believe that presence is one of only three or four elements that are necessary for a UC solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people consider presence to be a companion technology that goes along with instant messaging, telephony/VoIP, conferencing and mobile technologies. But if you are paying attention (and the posts above are well-worth reading), you can sense that people are beginning to believe that “presence” should be thought of as a topic in its own right – as a distinct and independent capability that augments other UC-related services rather than some type of sidekick that follows along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that have followed my research in the real-time collaboration field here at Burton Group and from my Meta Group days, you’re aware that I’ve talked about presence as an independent architectural domain within UC for some time (circa 2004 as I best recall). I’ve also posted previously on this blog about the &lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/presence/"&gt;changing nature of presence&lt;/a&gt; and the need to fundamentally reset our assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While presence will remain a core element within platforms for unified communications, the social dynamics around presence require all of us to look beyond how presence is defined, packaged and delivered by UC vendors (e.g., Cisco, IBM, Microsoft). The benefits of “presence” span far beyond the boundaries of unified communications. In fact, presence is on its own convergence path with social networking trends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I hope people tracking the UC space begin to recognize is that presence is more about enabling social context and social connectedness than it is about communicating awareness of a particular communicate state. Today, the UC concept of presence can be thought of as a type of network “state record” – the presence of an entity is made available to subscribers of that entity’s presence (e.g., displayed on a “buddy list” or within a presence-enabled application). The subscriber is often made aware that the entity is online and has some glimpse into their ability to communicate (e.g., “in a meeting”, “out to lunch”, “away from desk”). Modern systems typically include a richer amount of information including a profile of that entity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this capability is incredibly powerful (leading people to talk about the benefits of presence-enabled applications and communication-enabled business processes), it is also inherently limited by its underlying assumption of “state” and dependency (for the majority of vendors) on SIP/SIMPLE for the underlying infrastructure. Rather than think it terms of a “state record” (or row) where we keep adding additional information fields for presence and profile data (columns in that row), we should be examining social networking trends and how other tools are attacking the presence problem (even though the term “presence'” is not often used). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think In Terms Of “Social Presence”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many consumer social network sites (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, FriendFeed, and Plaxo) allow members to share a chronological stream of information about their activities with other followers or with those within their social graph. The idea of a chronological stream – or multiple rows – has interesting implications to establishing a sense of someone’s presence over time. Seeing someone’s presence over time has a powerful cognitive impact on how people feel connected to each other and are contextual aware of each other’s activities. We just don’t throw more columns at the problem to keep enriching the state record. (Note: this is a conceptual explanation, presence handling is more complicated than rows and columns but I’m using it metaphorically to illustrate the point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “lifestream” is often used to define this type of presence stream solution. Each entry (“row”) highlights an activity that someone has decided to share in a public or semi-public manner (e.g., a blog post, social bookmark entry, music rating, travel movement or status update). A presence stream reflecting activities of that person can be displayed in multiple contexts. The complete stream or fragments of the stream can show up on that person’s blog, or on the profile page of their social network site. Elements of their lifestream can be combined with entries from other people to form an aggregated stream of information that provides a more social view of the activities of people they are following. This new type of presence model creates a type of social context and sense of connectedness that is not easily replicated in the UC world.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this type of aggregation of activities enables a type of social awareness that builds on principles originally associated with the UC concept of “presence”. The intersection between social networks and unified communications will form the basis for a hybrid approach perhaps best described as “social presence”. Social presence provides a broader sense of awareness of a person’s interactions and activities by blending information from a variety of applications, productivity tools, social network sites and communication platforms into a chronological stream. The “over time” perspective one gains provides a richer sense of someone’s “presence” than the state-record snapshot we have today in UC platforms.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A social presence framework (illustrated below) might be modeled in the following manner: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/WindowsLiveWriter/image_16.png"&gt;&lt;img title="image" height="166" alt="image" src="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_16.png" width="244" border="0" style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications publish information fragments aggregated by a social presence component that centralizes the data. Correlation services analyze the information and package entries into an presence stream which is shared with subscribers. Blended group streams based on a collection of people being followed should also be supported. Applications could also subscribe to a “social presence” stream and contextually display that information as needed. What goes into this presence stream would be very open (e.g., blog posts, bookmarks, status messages, calendar events) in a way that mimics consumer counterparts (e.g., FriendFeed, Twitter, etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UC-related presence would be included in this model as a subset but the overarching solution is unlikely to be delivered by a UC platform itself. My firm belief is that such a solution cannot be delivered by platforms designed (and biased) towards SIP/SIMPLE. I honestly believe that the underlying assumptions (all the way back to the protocol specifications) bias UC-presence towards communications (which is perfectly fine). A social presence platform may however be delivered by some of those vendors that are active in the social computing space (but they really do need to start thinking more creatively and not be afraid to sub-optimize the overall presence role of their own UC platform). That said – some vendors have a shot here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avaya (even though they are a UC vendor) took a bold step by adopting XMPP for its presence server. Feed syndication platform vendors such as NewsGator and Attensa could play a partner role for larger vendors. Jabber and Jive could play in this area as well given their XMPP centricity. (Note: My current thinking is that a social presence platform would rely on a combination of Atom/APP, XMPP and microformats).&amp;nbsp; Larger vendors such as IBM would have to break from its UC-centric thinking around presence as would Microsoft. For Microsoft however this type of move is almost unimaginable given the centricity of OCS around SIP/SIMPLE and Microsoft's reluctance to integrate and interoperate with other vendors on a level playing field when it comes to presence. Oracle remains a dark horse as does SAP, although &lt;a href="http://blog.esme.us/?tag=sap"&gt;ESME&lt;/a&gt; is a nice start (congrats BTW to the people involved in ESME and  to Dennis Howlett who seems to be the proud mother at the moment).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UC evolution of presence will go along its maturity path and will remain critically important to many organizations (e.g., more intelligent/rich, integrated within business applications) but the original lofty vision of presence portrayed by UC vendors will transition to social networking platforms. Those vendors had their shot. But the foot-dragging on openeness/integration/interoperability along with narrow-minded thinking and competitive shenanigans more than justify these vendors being tossed out as far as being thought-leaders on where presence needs to go – presence is simply far too important to leave up to UC vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
