Every time I go back, I cook a lot. First, because most of my trips there are during the winter, and since we live in the middle of the countryside, there isn&#39;t that much to do. Second, Burgundy is heaven for anyone who loves food.&#0160;</p><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">We organized a party with many of our family members, and I was in charge of the meal. It&#39;s not that easy to cook for a bit less than 20 people, and yet, the challenge is very exciting. Among all the things that came to mind, I decided to create a very simple menu, made of a cauliflower mousse as an amuse bouche, foie gras with pineapple, cassoulet, cheese and dessert. I will blog about the cassoulet later. I wanted to spend some time talking about the foie gras.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Preparing foie gras always sound like a very long &amp; boring process while actually, it&#39;s fun, and extremely rewarding. Of course, you need to prepare it at least 5 days before eating it, but your fois gras will always be better than anything you buy, and you can actually get very funky during the marinating process.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">First of all, you need to buy a real foie. If you live in San Francisco, you can find them at the Golden Gate Meat, in the Ferry buildling. If you live in France, just go to your butcher! If you live anywhere else, well, you&#39;ll have to do some research!&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Before anything else, I always recommend to soak it in some milk overnight. It will take care of the blood. Then starts one of the funniest, and yet most important thing that you will do with your foie: removing all the nerves. Lay down your foie in order to see the separation between the two sides. This whole thing needs to happen without you completely destroying the foie. Try to keep the outside (the side laying on the table) intact, and be as brutal as you want with the inside. There is a main nerve in each side of the foie. Take care of that one. Then remove all the other little bit and pieces. ALL of them! It takes ages, it makes your hands dirty, but it&#39;s the secret to a good foie gras.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Once this is done, lay the foie creating a layer of 2cm height in a dish. Sprinkle with salt (1 teaspoon per pound) on each side and pepper. You can also add some alcohol (who doesn&#39;t like that?). This is the point where you can be fancy. For example, you can add bourbon, or orange vodka etc... Cover the foie with a plastic (very tight, no air between the plastic and the foie!) and let it rest in the fridge for 1 full day.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Boil some chicken stock. Transfer the foie in a&#0160;cheesecloth, and roll it to create a log. Make a strong knot on each end. Drop the foie in the boiling stock for 90 seconds. Remove and throw in ice water. At this point, the foie would have lost some of its fat. That is good! Don&#39;t be scared!&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Move the foie to a &quot;torchon&quot;. A torchon is an old napkin (in french), or anything similar to this. Roll the foie in the torchon (still in the cheesecloth), tie very hard and hang in a cold place for 2-3 days.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Your foie gras is now ready. And yes, it&#39;s really good!</span></div></div>

 The weather has been extremely warm recently in San Francisco. Last week-end, I was supposed to cook a three courses meal for some friends, and it was so hot that I was really wondering what type of food we could have with this temperature. All kinds of ideas went through my mind, but I decided to create a very fresh salad, with prawns and rock shrimps.&#0160;</span></p><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Rock shrimps are actually quite interesting to cook with. It can be very mushy and not good if you&#39;re not careful.

For your preparation, minced some garlic and shallots, roughly chop some mint, and finely chop some cilantro. Throw the prawns in some boiling water with lot of pepper and some salt, after 2 minutes, remove them, and then throw the rock shrimp. One minute later, they&#39;re cooked! Throw the prawns and shrimp in ice cold water.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Mix some mache salad with the mint, garlic, shallots and cilantro. Add some pepper and salt. Add the shrimp and the prawns. Then add the juice of 1 lime. Add a little bit of olive oil. Salt. Done</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">This is a very easy and refreshing dish.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">Have fun!</span><br /> </div></div>

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;
 From time to time, when the weather gets a little cold, I remember my grand mother in our house in the French countryside. When freezing outside, we would all stay home, in the kitchen (it was the warmest room of all) and watch her cook for us. Of course, at the time, no fancy dishes or stuff like this, only what we could get from our own land. She used to have tons of rabbits. Not pets. Rabbit that she was planning on eating at some point. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;The thought of eating rabbit may very well shock some of the readers of this blog. It&#39;s a pretty common dish in France, but I do understand why folks may think this is horrible. Rabbits are cute and lovely animals. I won&#39;t debate this here. Now, it&#39;s the same thing with any food you eat. You have to respect it. If you don&#39;t care about what you eat, throw away all of it, cook it poorly, then what the hell? Now, if you do care, show respect and passion, then, at least in my mind, things are a little different. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;When you see a rabbit being killed in the sole purpose of feeding a family, or when you actually have to do it yourself (my grand mother had me do it to make sure i understand why i should always respect my food and the real cost of feeding), then your attitude towards what&#39;s in your plate is changing. You understand the painful journey from animal to food. Every time I cook any piece animal, I always think about that (yeah, i basically had to kill myself all sort of animals for food: chicken, ducks, fish etc...). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;So when it was cold outside, my grandmother would kill a rabbit, bring it to the kitchen, and prepare it. I will skip the part where you actually prepare the animal and just focus on the cooking part. It&#39;s comfort food, so I won&#39;t give you any type of proportions. It has to be done &quot;roughly&quot;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;First of all, ask your butcher to cut the rabbit in 6 pieces. In a big pot (use those nice le creuset ones! they&#39;re actually authentic!), mix some canola oil and butter under high heat. Sprinkle your rabbit pieces with salt and pepper, and brown them in the pot. They have to be brown! And be very careful not to steam them by trying to put too many pieces at once. If you can only do 3 at a time, then take the time to do two batches! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;Once it&#39;s all brown, transfer the rabbit on a plate and let rest. Throw away the oil from the pot. Deglaze your pot with some balsamic vinegar. Add some butter and then add 1 diced onion and 2 carrots roughly chopped. Cook under medium heat for 10 minutes, until soft and brown. Add some garlic cloves (i usually put at least 6-7 cloves), skinned on, and crushed. A handful of thyme sprigs, some bay leaves, and a tiny bit of rosemary. Mix all this together then lay on top the rabbit pieces. Then add some wine (i do recommend some white burgundy wine like macon villages). The amount of wine really depends on several factors: 1. how much do you like wine? 2. do you want to keep a glass for yourself while cooking? This time, i actually put the whole bottle in my dish! Mix well and let simmer (covered) for a 50 minutes to 1 hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;At this point, you have to make a decision: do I want to eat this dish now or tomorrow? It&#39;s actually better if you&#39;re willing to wait for tomorrow, as the meat will then have time to rest in the juices and the braise. But you can also eat it straight away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;Put the rabbit pieces on a plate and reduce the wine sauce under high heat. You can add some flour to make it a bit thicker if needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;I would serve this with fresh pasta as the combination of the pasta and the wine sauce is just phenomenal! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; &quot;&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What I had in mind at this time was basically to do a full meal with one chicken, but different dishes. Interesting huh? My menu was still pretty straight forward: spicy chicken soup, and grilled chicken breast with salad and asian dressing. That was quite an experiment, but the goal was to use the whole chicken, including the bone for this meal!&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; ">First, I had to cut the chicken in 6 pieces (2 breasts, 2 legs and 2 wings) and i reserved the neck. Then I used the carcass to do a chicken stock. Once the stock ready, i added some ginger, cilantro, chilies, the 2 wings and the neck of the chicken. Salt, pepper, and I let this simmer for a good hour to make sure the chicken is cooked (not that you&#39;re going to eat it, but just in case :)). On the side, I grilled the breasts and the legs, that I had sprinkled with some rosemary, salt and pepper. I grill them skin side first, so it gets very crispy and brown, but you should start with the legs first as those will take longer.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; ">While this was grilling, I prepared an asian dressing. I don&#39;t think this has anything asian to it, but the tastes remind me of asia. I mix soya sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, some spicy sesame oil, a tiny bit of oliver oil, some minced shallots and add it to any salad. You can go create here. Mix any type of vegetable you like: green salad, soya beans, cucumber, red pepper, chinese cabbage, spring onions, etc... Any type of combination will work great!&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; ">Once the chicken ready, take a long p late. On one end, have a small ball with the chicken soup. In the middle, lay down some of the salad already dressed. On the right side, add one breast and one wing, sprinkled with a tiny bit of remaining dressing.&#0160;</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; ">There you go - this works quite well and is a perfect menu to use a full chicken!</span></div></div>
