<title>Europe&apos;s continental divide</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Though not as well known as the US version, <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/12/11/345-europes-continental-divide/">Europe has a continental divide located between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean</a>. It doesn't run along the Alps as much as I thought it would.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/europes-continental-divide">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>9/11, just like the movies</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://michalkosakowski.net/wp-content/uploads/films/JustLikeTheMovies.html">Just Like the Movies</a> is a short film by Michal Kosakowski that samples footage from movies that were made prior to September 2001 to recreate the events of 9/11. <a href="http://www.michalkosakowski.net/films/?view=just_like_the_movies_2">More info</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It's just like the movies!" was usually the first reaction of those watching the events of 9/11 in New York unfolding on their TV screens, no doubt recalling the endless number of catastrophes that Hollywood has proposed over the years. Now confronted with the reality of one such scenario -- of unprecedented destructive and symbolic resonance -- a feeling of deja vu arises while looking at these images.</p></blockquote>

<p>Really well done. (thx, christopher)</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/911-just-like-the-movies">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>Tower defense game for the iPhone</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If I am to maintain my current levels of productivity and balance in my life, I do not need a tower defense game on my iPhone. But if I *were* to bring such a thing into my life, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=292421271&mt=8">Fieldrunners</a> <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2008/10/06/fieldrunners-delivers-a-very-polished-tower-defense-game/">looks like a good candidate</a>. I can't wait until playing video games falls under the rubric of parenting. (Just kidding, Meg.)</p>

<p>Also, after a long period with no activity, <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com">Desktop Tower Defense</a> is <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/News.asp">set to be updated soon</a> (hopefully):</p>

<blockquote><p>Version 1.9 announced! I am working on an updated version DTD which will include multiplayer, extra modes and extra creeps. It will be released in the next few weeks so stay tuned!</p></blockquote>

<p>But they have <a href="http://blog.casualcollective.com/">a lot of other games under development</a> so I'm not holding my breath.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/tower-defense-game-for-the-iphone">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>Snark</title>

<title>Advertising in wireless network names</title>

<title>Robot density</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/7012">The world's robot density is highest in Europe</a>, although Japan makes use of robots at twice the rate of any other country.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are now 1 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is where they're the thickest on the ground. It has 295 of these electromechanical marvels for every 10000 manufacturing workers -- a robot density almost 10 times the world average and nearly twice that of Singapore (169), South Korea (164), and Germany (163).</p></blockquote>

<title>1905 subway ride</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3RjHPmU2vk&fmt=18">Here's a video from 1905 of a NYC subway car going from 14th Street to 42nd Street</a>. It's funny to see all the men in suits and hats running for the train...it takes some of the formality out what seems from photographs to be a more dignified time. Also, anyone know what line/train this is?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The inbox consensus seems clustered around the opinion that this train is running on the contemporary 4/5/6 line. <a href="http://nycsubway.org/perl/show?17506">Here's a 1904 map</a> which shows the then-IRT line in question (in red). At 42nd St, the line runs crosstown to Times Square and then up the 1/2/3.

<title>The age of mass intelligence</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Dumbing down? Perhaps not -- <a href="http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/age-mass-intelligence">it's the age of mass intelligence</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Millions more people are going to museums, literary festivals and operas; millions more watch demanding television programmes or download serious-minded podcasts. Not all these activities count as mind-stretching, of course. Some are downright fluffy. But, says Donna Renney, the chief executive of the Cheltenham Festivals, audiences increasingly want "the buzz you get from working that little bit harder". This is a dramatic yet often unrecognised development. "When people talk and write about culture," says Ira Glass, the creator of the riveting public-radio show "This American Life", "it's apocalyptic. We tell ourselves that everything is in bad shape. But the opposite is true. There's an abundance of really interesting things going on all around us."</p></blockquote>

<title>Atomic bombs, easy to make?</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Dueling book reviews! (Sort of.) First, a pair of books suggest, contrary to Robert Oppenheimer's post-war views, that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/science/09bomb.html?pagewanted=all">the US is the only nation to have developed atomic weaponry</a> and that all the other nuclear nations have gotten their information from the US program.</p>

<blockquote><p>All paths stem from the United States, directly or indirectly. One began with Russian spies that deeply penetrated the Manhattan Project. Stalin was so enamored of the intelligence haul, Mr. Reed and Mr. Stillman note, that his first atom bomb was an exact replica of the weapon the United States had dropped on Nagasaki.</p><p>Moscow freely shared its atomic thefts with Mao Zedong, China's leader. The book says that Klaus Fuchs, a Soviet spy in the Manhattan Project who was eventually caught and, in 1959, released from jail, did likewise. Upon gaining his freedom, the authors say, Fuchs gave the mastermind of Mao's weapons program a detailed tutorial on the Nagasaki bomb. A half-decade later, China surprised the world with its first blast.</p><p>The book, in a main disclosure, discusses how China in 1982 made a policy decision to flood the developing world with atomic know-how. Its identified clients include Algeria, Pakistan and North Korea.</p></blockquote>

<p>This week's New Yorker contains <a href="http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2008-12-15#folio=50">an article about a third book that's the culmination of more than a decade of research on the workings of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan</a> (subscribers only). From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/15/081215fa_fact_samuels">the abstract</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Coster-Mullen's book includes more than a hundred pages of declassified photographs from half a dozen government archives. Coster-Mullen, who is a truck driver by profession, sees his project as a diverting mental challenge. "This is nuclear archeology," he says.</p></blockquote>

<p>Coster-Mullen goes on to add that "the secret of the atomic bomb is how easy they are to make". His hand-bound book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006S2AJ0/ref=nosim/0sil8">Atom Bombs</a>, is available from Amazon.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/atomic-bombs-easy-to-make">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>Wes Anderson interview</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>On the occasion of the upcoming Criterion release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001EOQCL2/ref=nosim/0sil8">Bottle Rocket on Blu-ray</a>, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/wes_anderson_0">the AV Club interviewed Wes Anderson</a>. I love this bit about working with Gene Hackman.</p>

<blockquote><p>But Gene, I don't think loves being directed in the first place, and I had a lot of particular ideas for the way some things were to be done. He just wasn't getting a huge kick out of it -- but I don't know that he ever does. The main thing is that everything he was doing was great. Even though he can be belligerent, there's a lot of emotion there. I was always excited to be working with him, even when I was a little scared of him, just because this character that I'd spent so much time working on and was so invested in was being brought to life -- not only in all the ways that I'd wanted, but something quite beyond.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/12/wes-anderson-interview">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>ISO risky hugs</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A columnist for the Financial Times signs up for Illicit Encounters, a site for people who want to have affairs, and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/148959c4-c31f-11dd-a5ae-000077b07658.html">finds that there are lots of men from the financial sector trolling for a bit on the side</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>He said that, in a recession, people wanted hugs. This struck me as a pretty feeble explanation. Surely there are easier ways of getting hugs than putting one's marriage on the line? Hugging one's children or -- if one is desperate -- even one's spouse might seem easier and safer.</p><p>He said that this was just the point: that the risk was the lure. That bankers are suffering from a risk deficit: their working lives have been derisked compulsorily and this could be a way of compensating by adding risk to their private lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Who's gonna make the "Bankers Want Risky Hugs" tshirts? (via <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">mr</a>)</p>

<title>Dubbing The Wire into German</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.babbel.com/the-words-should-roll-out-of-the-mouths-on-the-dubbing-of-the-wire-in-german/">An interview with a translator about the difficulty of dubbing The Wire into German</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>To bring over the style of the speech out of the slums or ghettos, we haven't used very exact, grammatically correct German.

<title>‚óè Upgrade yourself</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>No one needs more stuff. But if you've got some disposable income burning a hole in your pocket, <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/108283/Upgrade-Me">here's a bunch of upgrades for your current possessions</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Can you suggest some replacements for standard, everyday household items that are far superior in terms of usefulness, luxuriousness and quality?</p></blockquote>

<p>My wife and I are ardent upgraders. I rarely buy anything anymore but the things I do buy are usually better versions of things I already have. As things break or wear out, we've been replacing them with items that are nicer to use/wear/whatever and will last a whole lot longer than the cheaper stuff. Here are a list of things that we've upgraded over the years that I would recommend.</p>

<p>Knives - Cooking is Meg's department but even a novice like myself has to admit: good knives are worth the extra money. The best part is that unless you cook all sorts of crazy stuff -- in which case you likely don't need this advice -- you only need two or three knives. Get a good chef's knife that fits well in your hand, a paring knife, and a serrated knife for slicing bread. Your impulse will be to skip the nice serrated. Don't...slicing bread is so much easier than with that flimsy piece of crap you have and it does tomatoes wonderfully as well. Keep them sharp and they'll literally last forever.</p>

<p>Miele vacuum - I have no idea which model we have -- it's the low-end canister model with just a few settings -- but it is the greatest vacuum cleaner in the universe. I don't mind vacuuming at all with this thing. Love it.</p>

<p>Tailored shirts - If you get yourself a tailor from Hong Kong, China, or the like, shirts tailor-made to your specific measurements don't cost much more than stuff off-the-rack from Banana Republic or whatever. And lemme tell you, tailored shirts fit really well and look amazing.</p>

<p>Pots and pans - Again, Meg's department, but proper cookware is really a pleasure to use. And it heats more evenly, you won't burn yourself grabbing the handle, blah blah blah. They'll last forever, even with heavy use.</p>

<p>Bed sheets - Flannel sheets for the winter are priced the same as regular cotton sheets but are way softer. For spring/summer/fall, go with something in the 400 thread count area. Sleeping and fooling around are so much better with nice soft sheets.</p>

<p>Mattress - <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/93956/">Slate says</a> that all mattresses are created equal but we got a firm mattress with a pillowtop and love it.</p>

<p>Headphones - Ditch those Apple earbuds and get yourself a pair of in-ear phones from Shure or Etymotic (or sound cancelling ones from Bose). They're expensive, no doubt. But you don't listen to crappy music so why listen to good music with crappy sound quality? </p>

<p>Coffee-making machine - I don't drink coffee but getting some sort of coffee contraption for the home, even an expensive one like an espresso machine, saves you lots in Starbucks purchases down the road.</p>

<p>Wine glasses - If you drink wine at all, get some nice glasses, even if it's only two glasses that you use for yourself when drinking casually around the house. Your cheapo wine will taste better.</p>

<p>Fleur de sel - Or Malden's or whatever your preference is. Regular table salt isn't ideal for salting food after it's served. Malden comes in nice flakes that melt nicely on the food. Meg prefers fleur de sel but I find it too crunchy. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EQSAIY/ref=nosim/0sil8">A 4 oz. container will cost you $11</a> -- 3 times as much as 3 pounds of table salt -- but it'll last for months or even years.</p>

<p>Shoes - Cheap shoes wear out quickly and can hurt your feet. A good pair of men's shoes made from quality materials will last for years; just keep resoling them.</p>

<p>None of these items are super-expensive...I think the mattress cost the most and it was under $800. We bought this stuff over a number of years and it probably worked out to an extra couple hundred dollars per year total. The upfront expense is sometimes tough to swallow but over time, you break even or even come out ahead money-wise (i.e. you'll never have to buy [item] ever again). The way I think about it is buying nice products that you'll use for several years/decades is both a financial investment and an investment in your personal well-being, even if it's just some nice salt to make your food taste a little better.</p>]]></description>

<blockquote><p>Jim Carrey will loom large in our shattered posterity, I believe, because his filmography amounts to a uniquely sustained engagement with the problem of the self. Who knows how the self became such a problem, or when we began to feel the falseness in our nature?</p></blockquote>

<title>Lost and found</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Henry Molaison -- more widely known as H.M. -- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/us/05hm.html?pagewanted=all">died last week at 82</a>. Molaison was an amnesiac and the study of his condition revealed much about the workings of the human brain. He lost his long-term memory after a surgery in 1953 and couldn't remember anything after that for more than 20 seconds or so.</p>

<blockquote><p>Living at his parents' house, and later with a relative through the 1970s, Mr. Molaison helped with the shopping, mowed the lawn, raked leaves and relaxed in front of the television. He could navigate through a day attending to mundane details -- fixing a lunch, making his bed -- by drawing on what he could remember from his first 27 years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Molly Birnbaum was training to be a chef in Boston when she got hit by a car and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/nyregion/thecity/07smel.html">lost her sense of smell</a>. Soon after, she moved to New York.</p>

<blockquote><p>Without the aroma of car exhaust, hot dogs or coffee, the city was a blank slate. Nothing was unbearable and nothing was especially beguiling. Penn Station's public restroom smelled the same as Jacques Torres's chocolate shop on Hudson Street. I knew that New York possessed a further level of meaning, but I had no access to it, and I worked hard to ignore what I could not detect.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://nervousacid.org/post/63920898/common-scents">Here's another take on anosmia and Birnbaum's article</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the first year of my recovery, I regularly visited both a neurologist and neuropsychologist who both disputed this claim. They told me that smell and taste, although related, are essentially exclusive. If anything, my neuropsychologist told me, smell is more integrated with memory.</p><p>In my experience, I've found this to be true: I have not lost my love of food; in fact, I feel like my appreciation for flavor combinations have been heightened. Milk does not taste like a "viscous liquid" to me and ice cream is certainly more than just "freezing." Similarly, a good wine is more than tasting the acids, a memorable dessert is more than simply sweet, and french fries do not taste like salty nothing-sticks.</p></blockquote>

<title>‚óè The prolific John Munch</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001938/">IMDB</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Belzer">Wikipedia</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Munch">here too</a>), Richard Belzer has appeared as Detective John Munch on ten different television shows, more than any other character on television. An exhaustive John Munch viewing would include shows from the following programs:</p>

<p>Homicide: Life on the Street<br />
Law &amp; Order<br />
X-Files<br />
Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit<br />
The Beat<br />
Law &amp; Order: Trial By Jury<br />
Arrested Development<br />
Paris enqu&ecirc;tes criminelles (aka Law &amp; Order: Paris)**<br />
The Wire<br />
Sesame Street</p>

<p>Belzer surpassed John Ratzenberger and George Wendt, who played barflies Cliff Clavin and Norm Peterson in six different series: Cheers, St. Elsewhere, The Tortellie, Wings, The Simpsons, and Frasier. (Ratzenberger apparently enjoys continuity; he's done a voice in every single Pixar movie, nine in all.) Munch/Belzer have been prolific in the matrimonial arena as well. Between the two, they've been married seven times (Munch:4 and Belzer: 3).</p>

<p>** It's unclear from the sources that I read if Munch has appeared on this show or will appear in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Two more things. <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/homicide.html">The Munch character was inspired by real-life Baltimore homicide detective Jay Landsman</a>...who both inspired another character on The Wire (named Jay Landsman) and appears in The Wire as a police lieutenant. All three -- Munch, the fake Landsman, and the real Landsman -- appeared in a fifth season episode called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0977184/">Took</a>. Oh, and Munch, like many other television characters, is <a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers.html">a figment of an autistic kid's fertile imagination</a>.

<title>Sine-wave speech</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/~mattd/sine-wave-speech/">Sine-wave speech</a> -- artificially degraded speech that sounds like old Doctor Who sound effects -- can be difficult to understand but becomes clear once the listener knows what to listen for.</p>

<blockquote><p>Listening to the sine-wave speech sound again produces a very different percept of a fully intelligible spoken sentence. This dramatic change in perception is an example of "perceptual insight" or pop-out. We have argued that this form of pop-out is an example of a top-down perceptual process produced by higher-level knowledge and expectations concerning sounds that can potentially be heard as speech.</p></blockquote>

<title>‚óè Disney&apos;s 1955 Man in Space film</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Man in Space was a short film made by Disney about the possibility of putting humans into space. The film was first shown in 1955 and features several prominent scientists of the day, including Wernher von Braun. The film is available for viewing on YouTube in eight parts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75vX6O8paGo&fmt=18">Prehistory of Rocketry</a> (1/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAYyEsUn87w&fmt=18">Early Rockets</a> (2/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYaJ7hNKuu4&fmt=18">How Rockets Work</a> (3/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdgHvuCEWnE&fmt=18">Space Medicine - Adapting to Space</a> (4/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIpcwLjRs4&fmt=18">Space Medicine - Dangers in Space</a> (5/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBi69V8oNuw&fmt=18">Werner von Braun - Designing a Rocket</a> (6/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy0fafgajWI&fmt=18">Conquest of Space - Launch!</a> (7/8)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVD11FE3oQ&fmt=18">Conquest of Space - In Orbit</a> (8/8)</p>

<p>Watch as they gloss over the use of rockets to bomb Europe during WWII and caution against smoking in space. Man in Space was followed by two other Disney short films, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Disney%27s+Man+and+the+Moon">Man and the Moon</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Disney%27s+Mars+and+Beyond">Mars and Beyond</a>. Particularly entertaining is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILjXGfTkKvk&amp;fmt=18">von Braun explaining his complicated plan to send a manned spaceship to the moon and back</a>, which involves a permanent orbiting space station -- which looks not unlike a giant bicycle wheel -- with a crew of fifty and powered by a nuclear reactor.</p>]]></description>

<title>If gamers ran the world</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Armitage imagines <a href="http://infovore.org/talks/if-gamers-ran-the-world/">If Gamers Ran The World</a>. For instance, what happens if the President of the United States in 2018 is the same age as Barack Obama is now.</p>

<blockquote><p>They're 45 in 2018 when they stand for office - that means they were born in 1973. They would have been four when Taito released Space Invaders came out; seven when Pac Man came out. In 1985, when they were 12, Nintendo would launch the NES in the west. At 18, just as they would have been heading to University, the first NHL game came out for the Genesis/Megadrive and might consumed many a night in the dorm. At 22, the Playstation was launched. At 26, they could have bought a PS2 at launch; at 31, they might have taken up World of Warcraft with their friends.</p></blockquote>

<title>[Sponsored by...] The Crust of the Matter</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>"Not for nothing have so many related the sensation one feels at this [the quintessential moment of nosepicking] to those produced by cocaine or alcohol or surfing the Internet..." So it goes in <a href="http://lawrenceshainberg.com/books">Crust</a>, the "Vonnegut-worthy" (Boston Globe) new novel from Lawrence Shainberg -- whose acclaimed previous works explore Buddhism, neurology, sports psychology and Samuel Beckett -- that tells the archly comic story of Walker Linchak, noted author of the Complete Series (The Complete Book of AIDS, The Complete Book of 9/11, The Complete Book of Terrorism) and widely acknowledged candidate for the Nobel Prize. Fans of Crust include Jonathan Lethem ("one of the most perverse satires I've ever read"), Norman Mailer ("daring, daunting, irreligious in the extreme"), The Los Angeles Times ("teases the very idea of postmodernism"), The Village Voice ("Half DeLillo's Jack Gladney...and half Christopher Hitchens, Linchak is a model pundit for a post-9/11 age"), Time Out Chicago ("provokes us to ponder the relationship between our public and private selves") and Pico Iyer ("This book has Zen scribbled all over it"). Set in New York and blurring the lines between online culture and the "real" world, Crust fearlessly remixes of-the-moment trends along with 23 photographs, illustrations, graphs, and charts plus post-White House IMs from one George W. Bush into a boldy original and yet oddly familiar view of life in the very near future. <a href="http://lawrenceshainberg.com/books">Crust</a> is the book that Jonathan Swift would have produced if he'd taken on the Information Age.</p>]]></description>

<title>Nano War</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Fun Flash game: <a href="http://nanowar.free.fr/">Nano War</a>. It's pretty easy to brute force your way through level 10 but after that there's some strategy required that I didn't have the patience to work out.

<title>‚óè My embarrassing web past</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Late last week <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/my-first-website/">Jason Santa Maria posted the first web site that he'd ever made</a> and asked others to do the same. The earliest web page of mine still online is a parody of <a href="http://www.suck.com/">Suck</a> that I did in March 1996 called <a href="http://0sil8.com/episodes/96/03/13/sock.html">Suck for Dummies</a>. (It's now called Suck for Dimwits because I received a C&amp;D from the X for Dummies people threatening to sue.) In June of 96, I made this over-the-top home page, <a href="http://0sil8.com/episodes/96/06/17/index2.html">Jason's Awesome WWW Home Page</a>. (Warning, &lt;blink&gt; tag usage!! Sign my guestbook! Top 5% of All Web Sites!!) I posted <a href="http://kottke.org/08/03/kottkeorg-is-ten-years-old-today">a bunch of old kottke.org designs</a> back in March but missed that the first few months of posts <a href="http://0sil8.com/episodes/98/03/14/index2.html">are still live in their original design</a>.</p>

<p>My earlier sites are lost, I think. (I have a few Zip and Jaz disks that might have some older stuff on them but I don't have the capability to read them anymore.) Before 0sil8, there were three or four efforts that I must have deleted from my hard drive at some point, including some embarrassing efforts involving fractals. The very first thing I did in HTML was a personal home page around Nov/Dec 1994 that lived on a 3.5" floppy. I coded it on the computer in my dorm room (using an early version of <a href="http://www.exit0.com/main/products/products.htm">HTML Assistant</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoStyler">Aldus PhotoStyler</a>) and then put it on a floppy to use on the computer in the physics lab, the only computer I had access to on campus that had internet access. The page was little more than a gussied up list of links that I liked to visit online, but I loved building, rebuilding, and redesigning it over and over, even though I was the only one who ever saw it. The handcrafted/DIY nature of building that page hooked me on web design. I would give almost anything to see that little page again.</p>]]></description>
