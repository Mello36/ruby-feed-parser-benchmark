<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>What&#39;s vexing our prospective customers? What have we as sellers failed -- in many markets -- to truly resolve for them? Why are they struggling to make successful decisions? </p><p><strong>While there are different issues to consider in different markets, we can identify certain patterns that have emerged</strong>. In today&#39;s markets, our prospective customers are struggling with: <strong><br /></strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Risk and Uncertainty</strong>. As the recent collapse of credit, property and stock markets suggests, customers face immense risks when they invest heavily in a particular offering. Individuals that trusted their financial advisors to help develop a plan that would serve them over time are&#0160;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105365cba0b970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Goaway" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef0105365cba0b970c " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105365cba0b970c-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 </span>
 stung by the news that their 401ks have plunged in value. While the advisors will argue that the markets will rebound as they always have in the past, the sense of anxiety is clear and present -- contributing to an individual&#39;s decisions regarding other potential purchases. Similar concerns about risk eventually lead to the tech bust at the turn of the millennium. Buyers began to question the value of the products on offer -- and the bubble burst. When prospective customers lack confidence about the direction of future events, they are likely to withdraw and become more difficult to engage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Choice and Confusion</strong>. While most of us want choice, there is a limit to how much choice we can manage. Right now, individuals are bombarded with messages, offers and options. One study by<em> </em>Yankelovich found that the number of marketing messages an individual confronts has risen from 2,000 a day in 1978 to 5,000 a day in 2008. Even in B2B markets, the diversity of options available tends to overwhelm prospects. They are often paralyzed by the array of products on offer -- unable to take a step forward and make a decision. Or, they will make a decision based primarily on price as the distinctiveness of offers presented to them is lost. In their confusion, they gravitate to the simplest variable in the decision equation: price.&#0160; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>In</strong><strong>creasing Complexity</strong>. With few exceptions, complexity is growing. Whether the issue revolves around networking a home of consumer electronics devices or implementing a customer relationship management system, the number of implications that emerge is rising considerably. With few exceptions, it&#39;s not enough to simply buy the product and use it. That may have worked at one time with a toaster or a TV. It no longer works with a personal computer or a wireless phone. These products no longer stand alone. They must be networked and connected. Similar with companies that are investing in business technology or professional services. They can&#39;t necessarily buy a product or hire a consultant and expect the problem to solve itself. Questions of leadership and communication, process redesign and organizational change must be addressed if these investments in complex solutions are to pay off. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unmet Expectations</strong>. One of the most damaging issues now affecting buyer confidence is the growing gap between the expectations set and the expectations met. Product sellers often think in terms of the quality and features of their offerings. Solution providers think in terms of the unique quality of their services and capabilities. But buyers think in terms of results. They aren&#39;t necessarily interested -- or primarily interested -- in all the bells and whistles. While styling is certainly important and certain features carry critical benefits, the consumer wants to know that the automobile is going to run without interruption and that the extended warranty plan will cover key problems that emerge. The company that invests in a new networking platform wants to ensure that certain levels of service are attained -- and uptime is high. When these expectations go unmet, disappointment reigns. This problem becomes particularly critical when a company tries to expand the relationship and present added offerings. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust and Credibility</strong>. Trust in business is at an all time low, according to surveys by Gallop and other organizations. Considering the growing number of companies now heading to Washington for a handout of your tax dollars, who do <em>you</em> trust? GM? Chrysler? Ford? Citicorp? AIG? Freddie? Fannie? You get the picture. Companies are up against high barriers of mistrust -- and low levels of confidence. Today&#39;s customers aren&#39;t sure who they can turn to -- and who they can count on. They are shaken. While the economy will most likely rebound within the next few years, the experience of seeing Fortune 500 companies begging Uncle Sam in the midst of economic crisis is not likely to be shrugged off so easily. Trust also suffered during the last downturn as dotcoms and tech companies reaped the backlash of all their overblown promises. But again, it&#39;s unclear that the trust gap is merely a cyclical phenomenon. Buyers need a reason to believe. They need to trust sellers. They need to find them credible. The bottom line is that they will expect much more from sellers in order to complete the transaction going forward. When the offer at stake requires a difficult decision, trust is the currency of the realm.&#0160;&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While buyers can&#39;t avoid making decisions altogether, their decisions have become more difficult and demanding.</strong> Certainly, the environment in which they decide has become more threatening. As individuals, they face severe risks to their personal wealth and esteem. As members of organizations, they feel the threat of downsizing and cutbacks. Decision teams have already begun to draw out their decision cycles -- or have canceled planned investments and purchases altogether.</p><p>So buyers are struggling to buy. They have their reasons -- as you can see here.</p><p><strong>The question is whether sellers could address many of these concerns by taking a different approach. </strong>As we&#39;ll be exploring in later posts, one key way of addressing them is by providing trustworthy and reliable guidance. </p></div>

It invites a follow up question in a way that &quot;I&#39;m a dentist&quot; or &quot;I sell life insurance&quot; might not. &#0160; </p><p>So what&#39;s a gravity well? <a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef01053633e284970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Thought leadership_gravity well" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef01053633e284970c " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef01053633e284970c-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 </p><p>Well...it&#39;s the pull of gravity exerted in space by a massive body. The 
 larger the body, the more gravitational force it exerts. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>While I have long embraced gravitational metaphors to describe my brand of thought leadership marketing, the term &quot;gravity well&quot; was brought to my attention by Roy H. Williams. </strong></p><p>Williams, aka <a href="http://www.wizardofads.com">The Wizard of Ads</a>, offered this concept as a way of explaining how we attract customers and win their confidence. Having frequently attended his seminars at <a href="https://wizardacademy.org/scripts/default.asp">The Wizard Academy </a>in the scenic hill country just south of Austin, he has profoundly influenced my own thinking and work.</p><p><strong>&quot;What a business wants is a committed customer,&quot; he writes in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magical-Worlds-Wizard-Ads-Techniques/dp/1885167520">Magical Worlds of the Wizard of Ads</a></em>. &quot;But a customer is far more likely to make a small commitment, or to increase an existing commitment by a small degree, than to make a large commitment abruptly. Commitment is rarely an all-at-once thing.&quot; </strong></p><p>With this in mind, the smart marketer constructs a gravity well. Think of it as a funnel that draws someone in and encourages him or her to stay. The gravity well &quot;softly pulls, entices, and seduces the customer into gradually deeper degrees of commitment...But at no time in the process is anyone asked to buy anything. That&#39;s the elegance of the gravity well.&quot; </p><p><strong>At the edge of the well, the prospect is offered something compelling, yet limited in terms of commitment. You can offer a subscription to a free newsletter or white paper, for instance. You may go from there to an invitation to a webinar -- again, free to the prospect, but with a greater commitment of time and perhaps, more information on a registration page.</strong> </p><p>You might go from there to a &quot;strategic assessment&quot; -- one that provides you access to the firm&#39;s key decision makers and influencers. It&#39;s a still greater commitment on the prospect&#39;s part, but you&#39;ve earned that by providing valuable insights and guidance in your prior interactions. </p><p>The assessment then sets the stage for an initial trial or project if this is justified by the findings produced in the assessment. It&#39;s up to the prospect at that point to determine if it makes sense to take the next step. Whether this particular project makes sense or not, you&#39;ve built trust and credibility all along the way. You are now a trusted authority in the prospect&#39;s eyes -- with an open door to continue introducing new ideas, options and opportunities.&#0160; </p><p><strong>You&#39;ve drawn them into your gravity well -- and you never once had to push, prod or persuade. You simply enabled your prospects to persuade themselves.</strong></p></div>

He knew that Big Blue had lost its ability to speak in the customer&#39;s language -- the language of business. <br /></strong></p><p>This is not an unusual problem. Many companies become too introspective. Software innovators think the poetry is in the code. Hardware executives think the beauty is in the box. Others merely spend an excessive amount of time talking about themselves and relating their own view of the world. They get lost in the features and functions of their products. They start presentations by relating all their own corporate accomplishments.</p><p><strong>Sadly, many firms often never wake up to the fact that customers don???t care. They just slip quietly into oblivion. Some, however, catch themselves before it???s too late. Take the case of IBM.</strong></p><p>The company certainly grew to global prominence as a result of visionary perspective of people like Thomas Watson. He saw the growing need for powerful computers throughout business and built his company with this in mind. However, the company lost its way along the way. It became known as big, bloated and arrogant.&#0160; </p><p><strong>It wasn???t un</strong><strong>til the early 90s that Gerstner presented a vision that could capture the imagination of this company and turn it around ???- positioning it for continuing growth</strong>. With tremendous foresight, he showed how the company could capitalize on the change facing the technology industry by providing a wider set of solutions -- based on product, service and consultative guidance.&#0160; </p><p>As a thought leader, he warned the entire technology industry that it was in danger of following he same path that had almost wrecked IBM.</p><p><strong>As
he later stated in his book, &quot;Who Says Elephants Can&#39;t Dance?,&quot; the tech
industry maintains a &quot;remarkable detachment&quot; from its customers. It
tends &quot;to ignore human behavior, human preferences, human biases, and
personal and institutional demands that emanate from the non-technical
parts of people&#39;s and companies&#39; lives.&quot;</strong> <strong>Gerstner added that if today&#39;s
technologists were to truly stand in their customers&#39; shoes they would
find &quot;the promises overblown and the returns more difficult than
promised.&quot;</strong></p><p>But he offered a way out.<strong> </strong>In his parting letter to shareholders, Louis Gerstner spoke of a
&quot;massive shift&quot; occurring in the technology industry. Technology
companies, he explained, must become increasingly &quot;customer-driven&quot; and
&quot;service-led&quot; if they are to address the emerging demands of the
market, and find success.</p><p>Gerstner???s compelling thought leadership repositioned Big Blue as the
powerhouse we continue to know and respect. He made an elephant dance.&#0160; </p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>But it was the new credibility he built -??? expressed in speeches </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>media appearances</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>position papers and, most powerfully, in the company&#39;s impressive financial performance</strong><strong> ???- that instilled confidence in IBM???s customers and all other stakeholders</strong>. <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"></span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

 Visibility begets more visibility. When well managed, visibility then strengthens trust and confidence.&#0160;</strong> </p><p>Perhaps one of the most visible CEOs in the current economic era is Steve Jobs. His personal story is so intertwined in the mythology of Apple, the company he founded in the mid-1970s with Steve Wozniak, that he offers a compelling example of this factor&#39;s powerful impact. <br /><strong><br />Jobs has gone from iconoclast to icon. He first challenged the premises of IBM and the computer industry by making the case for a personal machine that would bring computing to the &quot;rest of us.&quot; </strong></p><p>In 1983, Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple&#39;s CEO, with a simple question: &quot;Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water to children, or do you want a chance to change the world?&quot; The following year, his company&#39;s unforgettable &quot;1984&quot; Super Bowl commercial promised that the Apple Macintosh would transform the way we think about computing. </p><p><strong>The charismatic Jobs had become the visible face of the computer revolution. </strong></p><p>However, he wasn&#39;t prepared to follow Sculley. Described as an erratic and temperamental manager by many of his colleagues, Jobs was forced out in 1985. From there, he became the figurehead for a new era of computer-generated animation in film as the leader of Pixar. His company&#39;s arrangement with Disney enabled it to produce such compelling hits as <em>Toy Story</em>, <em>A Bug&#39;s Life</em> and <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>&#0160; </p><p>But it was Jobs&#39; return to Apple in 1996 and his subsequent performance that has locked in his iconic status and made him a visible force beyond the company&#39;s traditional fans. <a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361d23b1970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Steve_jobs_ipod_cover" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361d23b1970b " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361d23b1970b-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 </p><p>Indeed, his company&#39;s move into consumer electronics with hit products such as the iPod and iPhone have widened its circle of customers and driven its market value to impressive heights. <br /><strong><br />All the while, Jobs has remained a thought leader in the realm of high tech and a persuasive salesman of the Apple vision. His keynote speeches (colloquially known as &quot;Stevenotes&quot;) and performances at MacWorld Expos and Apple&#39;s World Wide Developers Conferences have helped to build the cult of personality that surrounds him and the fanatical devotion of customers to the Apple brand.</strong></p><p>What&#39;s most impressive is the way that Jobs&#39; following among &quot;early adopters&quot; in the high tech world has laid the foundations for him to &quot;cross the chasm,&quot; as marketing guru Geoffrey Moore puts it, into the wider world of consumer electronics that appeal to mainstream buyers. </p><p>The visibility of Jobs has risen over the years, contributing to the widely recognized and trusted Apple brand. In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, Jobs, who dropped out of college to pursue his dream, urged the new graduates to recognize their time to leave a mark is limited. </p><p>As he put it, <strong>&quot;Don&#39;t be trapped by dogma ??? which is living with the results of other
people&#39;s thinking. Don&#39;t let the noise of others&#39; opinions drown out
your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want
to become. Everything else is secondary.&quot;</strong> </p><p>Jobs ignored the dogma, elevating himself -- and Apple -- to a position of extraordinary influence.&#0160; By raising his own visibility, he helped to make the Apple brand one of the world&#39;s most trusted and respected. &#0160; &#0160; </p></div>

 best-selling book, <em>The Purpose-Driven Life</em>. His 23,000-member Saddleback Church, based in Lake Forest, Calif., has grown tremendously over the past quarter century. But it&#39;s the growth of Warren&#39;s personal influence that is particularly interesting. </strong></p><p>The power of this influence was most clearly on display during the recent presidential election when both John McCain and Barack Obama agreed to sit down with Warren during a &quot;civil forum.&quot; Both candidates were questioned by Warren for an hour apiece -- an unprecedented format that reflected the candidates&#39; desire to appeal to the vast evangelical Christian following that Warren has attracted. </p><p><strong>Warren first demonstrated his power as a thought leader in the mid 1990s. His Purpose-Driven Ministries non-profit was attracting pastors who wanted to hear his insights for growing successful churches and congregations.</strong> <strong><br /></strong></p><p>Having been influenced by the work of business thinkers such as Peter Drucker, Tom Peters and Jim Collins, Warren had unique and compelling views about organizing, promoting and building churches. His conferences were attracting 3,000 or 4,000 ministers at a time and his 1995 manual <em>The Purpose Driven Church</em> sold more than one million units. </p><p>His following rose to a whole other level with the release of <em>The Purpose-Driven Life</em> in 2002, a book that has sold nearly 30 million copies.&#0160; As <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1830147,00.html">Time Magazine</a><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"> recently put it</span>, he is &quot;unquestionably the U.S.&#39;s most influential and highest-profile churchman. He is a natural leader, a pathological schmoozer, insatiably curious and often the smartest person in the room.&quot; </p><p><strong><a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361cc252970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: left;"><img alt="Thought Leadership_Warren" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361cc252970b " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361cc252970b-250wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 Warren&#39;s influence, quite clearly, has been built on an array of communications media that have global&#0160; reach in our networked era. Saddleback Church has a web-site, <a href="http://www.purposedriven.com">PurposeDriven.com</a>, to help instruct individuals in his Warren&#39;s principles, provide curriculum and to communicate and coordinate the community. In fact, the church has trained over
400,000 ministers and priests worldwide in his
theology and practical methods. Saddleback&#39;s weekly newsletter, <em>Ministry Toolbox</em>, has a subscribership of 189,000 church leaders. </strong></p><p>Warren&#39;s vision now is directed at a extraordinaily ambitious project to mobilize Christians to fight poverty, illiteracy and AIDS worldwide. Five hears ago, he devised what he calls the PEACE plan, &quot;a bid to turn every single Christian church on earth into a provider of local health care, literacy and economic development, leadership training and spiritual growth,&quot; states <em>Time</em>.</p><p><strong>But none of this happened overnight. It was Warren&#39;s long-term vision
that drove his ministry&#39;s growth and has attracted so many disciples. &quot;Most people make two common mistakes,&quot; he told <em><a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/31/8359189/index.htm">Fortune Magazine</a> </em>a few years ago. &quot;We set our goals too low, and we try to accomplish them too quickly.&quot;</strong> </p><p>Warren explains that he is 25 years into a 40 year commitment to lead his ministry. He&#39;s thinking big picture and he&#39;s thinking big ideas, but his time horizon stretches out deep into the future. While he&#39;s not done serving his purpose, Warren shows how powerful ideas -- effectively communicated -- can turn a noble vision into a striking reality. </p></div>

What positions us as providers of <a href="http://www.brittonmanasco.com/2008/10/setting-ourselves-apart-with-superior-guidance.html">superior guidance</a>? </strong><strong>Three things: <em><a href="http://www.brittonmanasco.com/2008/11/rick-warrens-visionary-view-.html">vision</a></em>; <em><a href="http://www.brittonmanasco.com/2008/11/the-visible-man-apples-steve-jobs.html">visibility</a></em>; <em>and <a href="http://www.brittonmanasco.com/2008/11/closing-the-credibility-gap-ibms-lou-gerstner-.html">credibility</a></em>. </strong></p><p>Whether one is giving a presentation to a new audience of prospects, initiating a marketing campaign or provisioning sales for a credible customer conversation, these factors all come into play. They set the stage for the ultimate outcome. They influence a prospect&#39;s level of interest, degree of confidence and willingness to commit to change. Let&#39;s consider them one by one: <a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361cc724970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Thought Leadership_lighthouse 2" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361cc724970b " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef0105361cc724970b-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 </p><ul>
<li><strong><em>Vision</em></strong>. In an era of blinding uncertainty, people are drawn to those who make sense of the seemingly senseless. They are attracted to those who offer foresight and light the path ahead. While individuals and organizations with vision have always stood out in crowded markets, there is a growing opportunity today. Not only are markets much more competitive, they are more complex, fast-changing and fraught with risk. Those who can help their prospects see through the fog command their attention and establish trust in their eyes.&#0160; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Visibility</em></strong>. To attract an audience, it&#39;s critical to be visible in the marketplace. Some experts have even called this a &quot;visibility premium.&quot; Of course, it&#39;s important to be visible in ways that enhance one&#39;s brand as opposed to tarnishing it. The point is that one must influence the influencers, make appearances in key media and generate positive word-of-mouth in order to be recognized as an important thought leader in the first place. Visibility tends to grow in an expanding virtuous circle. The more visible you are, the more visible you become. &#0160; &#0160; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Credibility</em></strong>.To build trust and confidence, it&#39;s necessary to demonstrate one&#39;s credibility on a subject. Part of the challenge is articulating opportunities and challenges in truly relevant and compelling ways. Another part lies in demonstrating what impact you have had in the past. Customer success stories -- loaded with measurable impact -- are particularly valuable in this regard. But much of one&#39;s credibility is established through peer interaction and word of mouth. </li>
</ul>

<p>As I&#39;ll point out in the next few posts, <strong>there are several interesting examples in today&#39;s marketplace that reflect the power and value of these dimensions in a thought leader</strong>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>One of the most valuable reasons for creating new content -- be it a white paper, case study, presentation or some mix -- is to crystallize your position on a key issue</strong>. </p><p>Some people make the mistake of treating this marketing content as an end in itself. They just want a white paper to help produce leads during an upcoming product marketing campaign, for instance. They don&#39;t realize they are going through an exercise that can deliver dividends on many levels. <a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef010536134404970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Thought leadership_sun" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef010536134404970b " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef010536134404970b-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 <br /><strong><br />So, instead of investing your effort and attention in a &quot;white paper project,&quot; perhaps you should think of it as a &quot;positioning project.&quot; Not only does this reflect the wider array of benefits that the project can generate, it&#39;s a more accurate and descriptive term</strong>. </p><p>Why is that? Consider the payoffs associated with a content-driven, positioning project. You can: </p><ul>
<li><strong>Sharpen your message</strong>. By identifying and articulating the key market trends, problems, solutions, points of value and data points that are relevant to your audience, you engage them. You gain an opportunity to develop and strengthen the language you will use thereafter to persuade, communicate and educate. The sharper, clearer and more relevant your message, the more persuasive you become. </li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><strong>See from the customer&#39;s perspective</strong>. One of the hardest challenges facing a company that has been gearing up for a new product initiative is to accurately speak the customer&#39;s language. In the run up to the product launch, you&#39;ve been looking at the market from the inside-out. In some ways, this is inevitable. You are just trying to get to market. But now the focus has to shift. It&#39;s a difficult transition, but one that needs to be handled in a disciplined way. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drive consensus among the team and build momentum</strong>. By involving multiple team members in the project, you create more &quot;buy-in&quot; for the subsequent campaigns. They feel invested in the outcome if they helped create the positioning and messaging for it. Of course, they may feel far less invested if they aren&#39;t engaged in the process. That&#39;s why I encourage my clients to involve not only senior executives, marketers and product managers, but sales and other customer-facing professionals in the project. &#0160; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differentiate your company in a crowded marketplace</strong>. I refer to this content as &quot;thought leadership&quot; because it&#39;s an opportunity to stake out a forward-looking position in the marketplace -- hopefully one that is unique and insightful. This differentiates you and helps you establish a premium for the value of your brand. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generate and nurture leads</strong>. Demand generation, of course, is a powerful motivator for engaging in these projects in the first place. Prospective customers have difficult and demanding decisions to make. They need content that will guide them through these decisions. By providing relevant and actionable content, you move them down their decision path -- turning suspects into qualified prospects and from there, into customers. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provision the sales force</strong>. When the sales team engages your prospects, they will need a clear sense of the scope and magnitude of the problems that your firm hopes to solve. They&#39;ll need to ask clarifying and diagnostic questions that determine the level of concern the prospect is experiencing -- or might experience in the absence of a solution. Finally, they&#39;ll need to understand the value proposition you can bring and how to articulate it. Much of this business case will be articulated in the initial positioning project -- setting the stage for credible and compelling sales conversations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establish your company as a trusted authority</strong>. Yet another payoff associated with a positioning project is that it generates the relevant content -- the thought leadership -- necessary to establish your firm as a resource the prospect can trust. As they seek guidance in today&#39;s markets, they will increasingly value those who can provide it. By becoming a trusted authority, you reduce risk and build confidence. These are powerful assets in today&#39;s edgy and often shaken markets.&#0160; </li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s clearly a great deal of value to be generated by producing a white paper or an executive presentation -- value that exceeds the actual content itself. So why not acknowledge it in the way we think of and discuss these types of projects? <strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Companies that treat such projects as mere content creation are liable to under-invest in them and position themselves poorly. However, firms that recognize these </strong><strong> </strong><strong>projects</strong><strong> as opportunities to strengthen their positioning and create thought leadership are positioned to thrive.&#0160; </strong></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://www.exeros.com/">Exeros</a>, an enterprise software firm that specializes in Master Data Management (MDM), has found a compelling way to provide valued guidance to its prospects and turn them into customers over time. <strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>It launched an online university. </strong></p><p>How did this happen? Many of the prospects the company engaged at industry events said they were interested in its products, but were in early stages of project lifecycles and were unprepared to make a software purchase. Further, they stated that they needed more detailed information than they were getting at industry conferences and through other sources. This persuaded Exeros that there was an unmet demand for education on the subject of MDM. <a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef010535fa38c4970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="MDMGIF" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef010535fa38c4970b " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef010535fa38c4970b-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 </p><p>With this in mind, the company decided to launch what it is now calling <a href="http://www.mdmuniversity.com/index.html">MDM University</a> (MDMU). <br /><strong><br /></strong>Having initially considered putting its own name on the initiative or calling it a &quot;webinar series,&quot; Exeros eventually came to the conclusion that there was far more value in creating an entity that was independently positioned to provide thought leadership, training and education. </p><p><strong>As Denise Sparks, director of demand generation at Exeros, explained at MarketingSherpa&#39;s Demand Generation Summit last month in San Francisco, this was a &quot;classic lead nurturing situation. We needed a way to keep prospects warm while giving them the information they needed to keep our name in front of them.&quot; </strong></p><p>Exeros initially set up a series of five webinars to be delivered by industry experts. The next thing the firm knew it was behaving much like a media company. It promoted its events with email campaigns and electronic newsletters and sought sponsorship from complementary partners. </p><p><strong>The initiative has since evolved. It now has produced 18 webinars with 14 speakers in 5 topic areas. Through these webinars, it generated 2550 registrants -- half of which were new to the organization&#39;s database. The perceived neutrality of the site is certainly a driver of attention as is the ongoing movement of prospects from on-site venues (such as trade shows) to online ones (such as webinars).</strong></p><p>The company is now producing the webinars for approximately $2000 per event, but it&#39;s offsetting the costs through partnerships and sponsorships (that include lead sharing arrangements). Which brings up a good point: the need for total transparency. When prospects are called, the relationship between Exeros and MDMU is made clear by stating upfront that &quot;Exeros is one of the sponsors of MDM University&quot; and clarifying that this is the premise of the call. </p><p>The results are particularly interesting. When assessing prospects in the MDMU database, one finds that 8% are in active conversations (vs. 4% of those in the company;s standard database) and 40% are being actively nurtured (vs. 25% in the standard database). </p><p><strong>Sparks calculates that Exeros is generating raw leads through MDMU at a cost of $4-$17 vs. $100-$112 for those generated through external media approaches. She also notes that the quality of leads and information obtained are better through this approach than those generated by outside media companies</strong>. </p><p>The downside? &quot;It takes a great deal of time to execute,&quot; explains Sparks, noting that it means an additional web site to maintain and the necessity of having registration infrastructure (something made easier through marketing software from <a href="http://www.eloqua.com">Eloqua</a>). &quot;It also requires the constant care and feeding of participants.&quot;<br /><strong><br />What&#39;s clear is that Exeros has positioned itself as a trusted advisor and guide by launching its own online university. As buyers seek more education and advice in the years to come, this may prove a compelling tactic for many other companies. </strong>&#0160; </p></div>

 commitment and consistency. They are imperiled by improvisation, particularly now that other companies -- and most, especially, their rivals -- are getting their act together. <strong>Those who do this well are likely to become a magnet for customers. They will win trust and confidence at a time when those factors come at a terribly high premium.&#0160; </strong></p><p>That said, it&#39;s understandable that we should fall into this predicament. Thought leadership tends to fall between the cracks. While marketing and marcom might reasonably claim it as being within their immediate sphere of influence, top executive leaders might see themselves as the real thought leaders. Though leadership might also rise from product groups or, in some companies, the professional services team. </p><p>Thought leadership, as I define it, is about producing insight to guide customers through complex and demanding decisions. It&#39;s an emerging discipline that stands at the intersection of strategic positioning, demand generation and sales enablement. With that in mind, I am obviously partial to marketing taking the lead. </p><p><strong>But will marketing take the lead? </strong></p><p>Marketing groups, after all, have a lot on their plates these days. While sales teams are screaming for more (and better) leads and executive teams threaten to freeze budgets, marketing leaders are confronted by an arresting array of media, channels and choices. <strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>This situation can be quite paralyzing. Media, in fact, can quickly eclipse the message. </strong></p><p>Think of all the hungry media that now lay claim to B2B marketing budgets and staff attention today: search engines; email; direct mail; social networking; tradeshows; tele-sales; blogging; podcasting; videocasting; webcasting; content syndication; and conventional online/offline advertising. It&#39;s enough to spin heads. It&#39;s enough to send one off racing to the corner where thumb-sucking in the fetal position will momentarily ensue. </p><p>But observe that I haven&#39;t even waded into the question of what will be said in all this exploding media. Oops. Didn&#39;t consider that. No one made that an issue -- <em>until now</em>. </p><p><strong>Unfortunately, companies end up presenting themselves in a drearily dull fashion when they improvise their way through this part. They fall back on the thing they know best: <em>themselves</em>. But even if they give it the old college try and attempt some customer-focused content on the fly, the absence of committed effort (and investment) will soon become transparently apparent. </strong></p><p>That&#39;s why this can&#39;t be faked or finessed. Thought leadership -- the source of all conversations to follow -- requires real effort and real commitment. The beauty, as I have written elsewhere, is that the content you create has many applications. And you may not even have to create it all -- merely aggregate it from other sources and present it in compelling new ways. It merely has to be relevant and useful. It has to guide prospects along the decision cycle. </p><p><strong>Rather than improvise, I work with my clients to <em>systemize</em> their thought leadership endeavors</strong>. I encourage them to develop a strategic content plan: determine the issues they want to own, map content against customer decision cycles, develop editorial calendars, identify key resources and participants, and execute against the plan. </p><p>Once they have a <a href="http://www.brittonmanasco.com/2008/11/want-to-increase-your-gravitational-pull-produce-relevant-content.html">steady flow of relevant content</a>, they can actively merchandise it in various media and channels. They set the agenda instead of having it set for them by the fashions of the moment. </p><p><strong><em>What are your thoughts on this subject? How can marketers systemize thought leadership to achieve greater marketing success? I&#39;d love to hear your perspective.</em> </strong></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>You keep hearing that phrase. And it&#39;s not going away. You know the one: <em>relevant content</em>. </strong></p><p>That&#39;s the new source of marketing success -- the gravitational force that will draw prospects into your orbit. The question is: What type of content is relevant to today&#39;s prospects and customers?&#0160; </p><p><strong>Let me offer five types of content -- what I call <em>elements of insight</em> -- that I believe can be not only relevant, but compelling and actionable</strong>.&#0160; Among them: </p><ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Frameworks of the Future</strong></span>. This is content that provides clarity, context and foresight. It gives
 our audience a sense of what lies ahead -- though it establishes context for prognostication by <a href="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef010535efd8eb970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Thought leadership_Satellites" class="at-xid-6a00d8341cafe453ef010535efd8eb970c " src="http://brittonmanasco.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cafe453ef010535efd8eb970c-250wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 250px;" /></a>
 drawing on what has happened in the past and what is happening in the present. In an increasingly complex and confusing world, our prospects are hungry for a sense of what comes next. They want models that make sense, frameworks that cut through the noise. The more predictable we can make the future, the lower the risk and the higher the perceived value. If they have confidence in our forecasts, they&#39;ll have courage to take the appropriate action. Answer the questions: What comes next and how can I profit from that knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Findings from the Field</strong></span>. Our prospects want proof. They want evidence. They want a track record. The findings we offer are evidence that our perspective or point of view carries weight. So where do we get the proof? It probably lies in customer success stories. Rich and vivid case studies can make the abstract real -- providing prospects with something memorable and shareable. But findings need not simply be anecdotal or qualitative. Evidence also can come in more quantitative and measurable forms. Surveys and statistics can go a long way in terms of establishing credibility -- whether they are drawn from a third party or generated in-house. Answer the questions: What&#39;s happening in the real world and why should I believe?&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Winning and Worst Practices</strong></span>. Everyone wants to know the lessons learned. What went right? What went wrong? In fact, stories of spectacular failure and crushing defeat are likely to go much farther in terms of engaging audiences and establishing credibility. The point is, our prospects need to know what is the right path to take if they were to take the advice that we are offering. They want to learn from those who have gone before. If we can make that insight available to them, then we become a valued advisor. Answer the questions: What is the right path to success and how can I avoid unnecessary missteps?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tips, Tricks and Tools</strong></span>. Yet another valuable source of content is anything that helps the prospect in a rapid, actionable and tangible fashion. Some advice has immediate applicability in given situations. Tips and tricks can address a specific challenge -- one that others have faced previously. Tools, meanwhile, might be spreadsheets that help one tally up an ROI and develop a business case. Or perhaps, it&#39;s a needs assessment or a buyer&#39;s guide -- a checklist that enables a prospect (or decision team) to diligently engage in a decision. Answer the questions: How can I make a more&#0160; successful decision and how can I implement this solution more successfully?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Demonstrations and Visualizations</strong></span>. Visual explanations have great power. As software companies have long understood, there&#39;s tremendous value in a well constructed demo. (There&#39;s also the potential to bore your prospects to death with a poorly constructed one.) The point is that our prospects want visuals and demonstrations -- hopefully, ones that they can navigate and play with at their own pace -- that vividly explain the concepts we are presenting or the value we are projecting. I expect to see more and more smart work in this regard as companies seek to accelerate the customer learning process and make difficult concepts easier to grasp. Answer the questions: How does this work and how can you help me understand it? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once you&#39;ve created this &quot;source content,&quot; you then can package it in
many forms (white papers, case studies, presentations, blogs, newsletters, marketing pieces, conversational
guides, etc.) and then merchandise it in many channels (search engines,
direct marketing, public relations, sales engagement, etc.)</strong>. Make it once; market it many times. There are all sorts of opportunities to generate business value from this content. </p><p><strong>Just remember: Conversations are critical these days. Markets, as they say, are conversations. But you have to hold up your end of the conversation</strong>. You have to have something to say -- and, perhaps more importantly, something to ask. If you weren&#39;t engaged enough in your area of expertise to dive in and create valuable content in the first place, you may not be curious enough to ask the right questions. And if you don&#39;t ask the right questions, you&#39;ll never get to the right answers. </p></div>
