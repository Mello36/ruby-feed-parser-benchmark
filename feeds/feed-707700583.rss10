<description><![CDATA[Bilingual Night Time Field Supervisor and Building Maintenance
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
COMPANY 
<br>

<br>
we are an established San Francisco based commercial janitorial and building maintenance company. We have been in business for over 15 years, and are continuing to grow.

<br>
As a field supervisor you will be responsible for making sure the janitorial work at our properties is going smoothly; and to support the on site supervisors at our locations that are cleaned during the night. 
<br>

<br>
As a field supervisor you will spend most of your time at our job sites interacting with our clients and our employees. Field supervisors handle employee concerns; make sure the properties have ample supply of chemicals and equipment, often setting up special projects that require addition personnel or logistics outside of our usual scope of work.

<br>

<br>
Knowledge of janitorial processes is a big plus... for example stripping and waxing floors, carpet cleaning window cleaning….etc

<br>

<br>

<br>
ENVIORNMENT 
<br>

<br>
The environment here is fun, yet professional. Our company is doing well, so we are busy. This is a high-paced atmosphere both in an out of the office. 
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
COMPENSATION 
<br>

<br>
