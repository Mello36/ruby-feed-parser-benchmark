Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying with the DMCA, Intalio, Inc. will act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, and will act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any reference or link to material or activity that is claimed to be infringing.

If in-person appearance is required, it shall be held in Santa Clara County, California or another location mutually agreed upon by the parties. In all such cases, the arbitration shall be administered by the <a href="http://www.adr.org/index2.1.jsp">American Arbitration Association</a> or <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/search_results.asp?practice=0&specialty=0&location=4">JAMS</a> in accordance with their applicable rules, or any other established ADR provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li> <li><strong>Court.</strong> Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California or where the defendant is located (in our case Fremont, California, and in your case your home address or principal place of business). You and Intalio, Inc. agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California.</li> </ol> <p>All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief) between the parties must be resolved using the dispute resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section by the first party to file a Claim.

GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>The Terms constitute the entire agreement between each user and Intalio, Inc. and govern each user's use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements. Each user may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when that user uses affiliate services, third party content or third party software. The Terms and the relationship between each user and Intalio, Inc. shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions and each party shall submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.</p> <p><strong>21.

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-toc"><h1>Backward Compatibility</h1><ul><li><div>For users who are reusing the same workspace location,&nbsp; a window may pop up saying that the Process Explorer cannot be found. Please do Window &gt; Reset Perspective in Intalio|BPMS Designer 4.2 to reset the Process Explorer. The Process Explorer may not work properly until&nbsp;the perspective is reset.</div></li><li><div>For users who are reusing the same&nbsp;workspace location, automatic generation of WSDL and XSD files for the wokflow forms may not work until you right-click on your project and select BPMS Designer Tools &gt; Update BPMS&nbsp;Builders.&nbsp; </div></li></ul><h1>New Functionality</h1><ul><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Designer provides an extended Process Explorer that provides much more information about project resources than before and also validates WSDL and XSD files. Errors are reported in the Problems view and inline the text editor for such resources. See the <a class="undefined" href="content/view/116/86/">Intalio|BPMS Designer - Process Explorer user guide</a> for more information.</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Workflow now supports attachments. For any task, attachments can be added directly from the web User Interface. See the <a class="undefined" href="content/view/117/86/">Intalio|BPMS Workflow User Interface</a> user guide for more information.</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Workflow Form Editor provides a new Table control.</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Workflow Form Editor provides 'group' and 'ungroup' tools to place selected controls in a group or extract them from an existing group.</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Workflow now support 'chained execution', i.e. the succession of forms driven by a process flow. See the <a class="undefined" href="content/view/115/83/">Store Example</a> that illustrates this new functionality.</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS now supports a new implicit process variable called $pxe:pid that may be used in any data mapping. This variable does not appear in the Data Editor nor the Data Mapper, but can be used in operators. It returns the unique ID of the process instance as a string. See <a class="undefined" href="content/view/96/86/#UsingPIDvariable">Using the $pxe:pid variable</a>.</div></li></ul><h1>Enhancements</h1><ul><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Designer, the Mapper Palette now provides a &quot;Favorites&quot; group into which user favorite operators may be added/removed (right click on any operator and select &quot;Add to favorite&quot;, to remove a favorite, right click and select &quot;Remove&quot;).</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Designer now installs with its own Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to avoid potential conflicts with already installed JREs. It is no longer necessary to install a JRE before installing Intalio|BPMS Designer.</div></li><li><div>In the Data Mapper, the middle section where operators can be dropped now provides scroll bars to acces operators that would be located out of the visible area.</div></li><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Designer, the Process Explorer will prevent users from drag-and-dropping schema elements from files located in the build directory.</div></li><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Designer, it is possible to hide/show the grid in the Data Mapper.</div></li><li><div>Improved reporting of deployment errors in Intalio|BPMS Designer.</div></li><li><div>The Data Mapper will no longer allow users to create more links than the target operator can support.</div></li><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Designer, users can right-click on a message link and select 'Show shema in Process Explorer' or 'Show schema element in Process Explorer' to locate the corresponding schema or schema element in the Process Explorer.</div></li><li><div>In the Data Editor, the tool automatically switches to the Connector tool when moving the mouse over the sides of an operator. It is no longer necessary to explicitly select the Connector tool to link an operator.</div></li><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Designer, the wizard to create new process diagram now allows using the hyphens.</div></li><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Workflow Visual Connector now generates WSDL and XSD files for all types of tasks and it is no longer necessary to define a task type property in the Form Editor.</div></li><li><div>When deploying forms from Intalio|BPMS Designer, a dialog box pops up to report whether deployment was successful or not.</div></li><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Workflow Form Editor, the property 'name' of each field is now automatically populated with a name that matches the 'label' property. The 'name' property may still be explicitly modified in the Properties panel.</div></li></ul><ul><li>Intalio|BPMS Community Edition now embeds Apache Axis2 1.0 (was version 0.93 before).</li><li>In Console, display fault information when instance fails.</li></ul><h1>Fixes</h1><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>In the Console, the Web Service Invocation feature to start any process now works even if the process and/or its dependencies are not placed in the root project folder.&nbsp;</div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div>Intalio|BPMS Designer now successfully deploys diagrams that have multiple process pools. In previous version, only one process pool would be successfully deployed.</div></li><li><div>In the Data Mapper, it is now possible to update an operator that was already linked to a target node.</div></li><li><div>In the Data Mapper, linking an invalid literal will no longer corrupt the data model.</div></li><li><div>Some issues with drag-and-drop in the Data Editor have been fixed.</div></li><li><div>The zoom tool in the Data Mapper has been fixed.</div></li></ul><ul><li>In Intalio|BPMS Workflow UI, process and task creation time&nbsp;is now properly updated.</li><li>Resolved minor filtering issues in the Console</li><li>In Server, fixed memory leak issue with connections from Console<br /></li></ul><h1>New Limitations / Issues Identified In This Version</h1><ul><li><div>People Initiating Process Activities fail at runtime when the form canva contains more than one control. The workaround consists in grouping all controls inside a group control (this way the form canva contains only one control: the group control). This does not affect forms used for people activities, only People Initiating Process Activities.&nbsp;In the log, this error is logged as 'ERROR [ProcessorService] Exception at oxf:/formManager/init-action.xpl, line -1, column -1' as a result of a SOAP fault being returned to the SOAP request that is sent to initiate the process when the user clicks the 'Submit' button. The SOAP fault&nbsp;has the following properties: fault code:&nbsp;'soapenv:Client'; fault string 'unknown'; and the detail shows a stack trace with an org.apache.axis2.AxisFault exception.</div></li></ul><h1>Remaining Limitations / Issues Reported In Previous Versions</h1><ul><li><div>People Initiated Process Tasks must be registered from the Intalio|BPMS Workflow Deployment Service command line&nbsp;tool.</div></li><li><div>In Intalio|BPMS Designer, the function &quot;Layout All Shapes&quot; does not scale.

            <title>Intalio|BPMS 5.0 ALPHA</title>
            <link>http://bpms.intalio.com/content/view-69.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div>
<p>
Version 5.0 <em><strong>Alpha</strong></em> is the first to
integrate a brand new BPMN modeler. This new modeler features improved usability, better control on positioning and adds supports for  Linux and Mac OS X in addition to the already-supported Windows platofrm.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<strong>
The goal of this
version is to gather feedback on the process modeling experience.</strong>  In that respect, Intalio welcomes alpha testers to <a href="/component/option,com_joomlaboard/Itemid,47/func,showcat/catid,22/" target="_blank">provide feedback on the new modeler</a>  so it can be improved for
the final release.
</p>
</div>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	Version
	5.0 Alpha does not generate BPEL code -- even for simple processes. Users interested in generating the code should wait till version 5.0 Beta. Version 5.0 Alpha focuses on the process modeling experience and for this reason we have disabled BPEL code generation while we are still busy reimplementing and improving some code generation aspects.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Version
	5.0 Alpha does not import process diagrams built with previous versions
	of Intalio|BPMS Designer. This capability will be introduced in version
	5.0 Beta. In version 5.0 Alpha users should model new process diagrams
	from scratch. Users interested in reusing processes they have designed
	in previous versions of the product should wait till version 5.0 Beta.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>No Form Editor<br />
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Now that we&#39;ve cleared the way with warnings and big caveats, here&#39;s the list of improvements and benefits for the new release (some are still in very rough shape, so be patient...)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Modeling </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Diagram Assistant (context sensitive popup palette that lets you add shapes right from the diagram)</li>
	<li>Real time alignment guides, allowing you to easily alisgn shapes as you move them<br />
	</li>
	<li>Ability to switch the type of activity in the context menu (no more remove, add, recreate flows)<br />
	</li>
	<li>Can attach a file of any type to activity (for documentation
	purposes). Can also set a URL. Both can then be opened directly from
	within Intalio|BPMS Designer</li>
	<li>Better control of flow links
	and message links (where they go, where they turn (bendpoints), ...) 
	Customization of the router will still need to be improved.<br />
	</li>
	<li>New Duplicate shape feature<br />
	</li>
	<li>Edit shape properties directly from properties pane<br />
	</li>
	<li>New shapes palette</li>
	<li>New Outline Pane</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Data Editor</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Activity flow is displayed in data-editor : sequences, branches, conditions and is in the same order<br />
	</li>
	<li>Can use Schema Elements or Schema Types for defining message structure (could only use Elements before)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Validation/Generation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Validation of the diagrams occurrs without loading it in the editor by building the project<br />
	</li>
	<li>Better error reporting (by using markers right on the diagram).  Validation is also now fully integrated with eclipse build system.<br />
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><br />
</h3>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Built in XML and XML Schema Editors (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Introduction_to_the_XSD_Editor" target="_blank">eclipse WTP-WST</a>)
	</li>
	<li>Support for Mac OS X, Linux, Windows</li>
