After being in development for two years, this version feels like the kind of solid media player we’ve been expecting and hoping for all along. Although nothing is entirely bug-free, this release worked smoothly, with both performance and stability seeming greatly improved. Combine that with its extendibility through the the use of add-ons, and you’ll find Songbird has a lot of promise as a worthwhile iTunes replacement.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_apple_should_be_worried_about_songbird.php" target="_blank"&gt;Why Apple Should Be Worried About Songbird - ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description><link>http://transnets.tumblr.com/post/64215597</link><guid>http://transnets.tumblr.com/post/64215597</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2008 19:31:06 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>"Fourteen of the world’s largest mobile phone and chip makers, including Sony Ericsson,..."</title><description>“Fourteen of the world’s largest mobile phone and chip makers, including Sony Ericsson, Vodafone Group Plc and ARM Holdings Plc, joined the Open Handset Alliance on Tuesday to support the Android mobile device platform developed by Google Inc.

In 1999, 91% of data from Asia passed through the United States at some point on its journey. By this year that number had fallen to just 54%. The change was even more pronounced in Africa. Nine years ago the US was involved in 70% of internet traffic coming from the continent, but that number has decreased to just 6% as more can be directed internally, or through Europe and the Middle East. “There used to be a phenomenon on the internet called ‘tromboning’,” said Schoonover. “If I were sitting in Singapore or South Africa and I sent an email to a friend three houses down, it was just as likely that the email was going to traverse New York City as somewhere local. “What we see now is that phenomenon becoming less and less apparent as more local hubs and internet exchanges crop up in Latin America, in Asia and a few in Africa.””&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/08/internet-usa" target="_blank"&gt;America is losing its position at the centre of the internet, according to a new study by TeleGeography Research | Technology | guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description><link>http://transnets.tumblr.com/post/63999184</link><guid>http://transnets.tumblr.com/post/63999184</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 17:20:12 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>"Beyond the billions of dollars lost in theft of money and data is another, deeper impact.

Many Internet executives fear that basic trust in what has become the foundation of 21st century commerce is rapidly eroding. “There’s an increasing trend to depend on the Internet for a wide range of applications, many of them having to deal with financial institutions,” said Vinton G. Cerf, one of the original designers of the Internet, who is now Google’s “chief Internet evangelist.” “The more we depend on these types of systems, the more vulnerable we become,” he said.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/technology/internet/06security.html?pagewanted=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th" target="_blank"&gt;Thieves Winning Online War, Maybe Even in Your Computer - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description><link>http://transnets.tumblr.com/post/63986578</link><guid>http://transnets.tumblr.com/post/63986578</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 16:01:56 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>"To help sift through all the choices, companies including VideoSurf and Digitalsmiths have developed..."</title><description>“To help sift through all the choices, companies including VideoSurf and Digitalsmiths have developed search tools.

It’s a premium vendor with a premium product that thrives off its higher price point. Why should it fiddle with a strategy that has worked for years just because the competition is trying to find a way to increase its own PC sales as Apple gains market share with each passing month? The sweet spot for Mac pricing is $999. And thanks to the MacBook, Apple hits that psychological threshold and makes consumers believe that although its low-end MacBook is more expensive than the $500 junkers HP and Dell are selling, they provide more value. And just in case you want to measure Apples-to-Apples, I think you’ll quickly find that an HP or Dell notebook with a configuration that’s comparable to Apple’s MacBook isn’t that much cheaper. Heck, Dell’s Inspiron 13 laptop’s top-end configuration starts at $820 ($1,139 before instant savings).
