<p>We all know that God deserves our everything. We all go through those times when we genuinely look at what He has done for us and promise to do anything He asks as our offering in return.</p>
<p>However, how often have you said &#8220;&#8230;. but I won&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just two days away from the start of the 12 Days of Christmas Challenge, are there things that you are saying to God you won&#8217;t do?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll go to Africa if you ask but I won&#8217;t get up at 5 in the morning to make breakfast for homeless people. I need my sleep!</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll volunteer in a homeless shelter but I won&#8217;t volunteer on the ushers team on a Sunday morning.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to work with those people because they smell or I might catch something</li>
<li>I won&#8217;t do anything with HER because she is just so annoying!</li>
<li>I won&#8217;t give up my time with my kids</li>
<li>I won&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<div>Now is the time to stop saying no, die to yourself and just do what God calls you to do.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not promising any reward, that&#8217;s the whole point. We don&#8217;t serve God and serve man for the reward, we serve out of love - and out of obedience. If God chooses to reward you for that then that&#8217;s His right, but He doesn&#8217;t have to (See <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=17&amp;version=31" target="_blank">Luke 17:7-10</a>).</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have been thinking a lot about what I and my wife and kids can do each of the 12 days and have a few things to share:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I have made a <a href="http://www.hafchurch.org/12days.htm" target="_blank">12DoCC planning calendar</a> to help you plan what you will do. You can <a href="http://www.hafchurch.org/12days.htm" target="_blank">view it here</a> or download a <a href="http://www.hafchurch.org/12DoCC.doc" target="_blank">word document</a> of it here. This is to help you think in advance what you can do every day. Some days you will just have to wait for God to show you what He wants you to do, other days you may need to plan in advance like volunteering opportunities or visitations.</li>
<li>My wife has a problem in that she works 12 hour night shifts in the local ER. This means that between Sunday and Wednesday she is either at work or asleep. He opportunities for giving are thus limited. She&#8217;s going to take blankets and things like that in case any homeless people come in that need such things but she is limited in what she can go out and do. I see no problem with her doing two things some days and nothing on others. God is not mean, He&#8217;s looking at your heart. If she, or you, genuinely look for opportunities to give and don&#8217;t find any some days but then find multiples on other days I think God is quite happy with that.</li>
<li>Get creative in your giving. For instance, my wife has a coworker who urgently needs time off but has no vacation time available. The company has a policy where other people can donate their vacation time so my wife is going to donate some of her vacation time to this person who needs it. This is a big sacrifice for her, we value days off for family time!</li>
<li>Just because you enjoy it that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not giving. We are going out carol-singing. It&#8217;s a great outreach and the people in our neighborhood really appreciate it. Doing it is an act of service to them but it&#8217;s also something we enjoy. That&#8217;s OK&#8230; God wants you to enjoy your giving!</li>
<li>Things you already do count! If you already serve in one way or another, be it at church or in the community then those things count as your giving. The idea is to give in one way or another every day, it doesn&#8217;t have to be giving over and above what you already do.</li>
<li>The Salvation Army or your local rescue mission or places like that can always use volunteers even if it&#8217;s just for an hour or two. Drop by and see what they need.</li>
<li>Anything which means you are dying to yourself a little counts - that includes dying to your pride. One day you could call that relative you haven&#8217;t been on speaking terms with for years. God loves that kind of thing!</li>
</ol>
<div>Have fun with this, get creative and don&#8217;t worry. God is not an ogre with a big stick, He&#8217;s just looking for readiness and faithfulness!</div>
</div>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a pastor to have a relationship with God.</p>
<p>This is one of the central themes of my life and to me it is one of the most important things that Christians need to learn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into all of the teaching here, I might do that another time but it comes down to this:</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:9 &#8220;But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter whether you have a pastor, priest, bishop, vicar, reverend or whatever you may call them, we tend to think in terms of two-class Christianity.</p>
<p>One class is the leaders (pastor, priest, bishop etc etc) and the second class is everyone else. Try as we might, we all too often think in terms of these classes, creating a &#8216;priesthood&#8217;, whether you use the word &#8216;priest&#8217; or not.</p>
<p>The problem with a priesthood is that when we have one, we can easily slip into thinking of them as &#8216;better Christians&#8217; or people who are closer to God. Somehow we think that God listens to members of the priesthood more or that he speaks to <em>them</em> and not to <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>The verse from 1 Peter above blows that idea out of the water. It is written to all Christians. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All Christians</span>. That means YOU. </p>
<p>You are part of the royal priesthood. You are a priest of God. You have a direct connection with Jesus Christ. There is no-one who should try to come between you and God, it is your right as a born-again child of God to be able to talk with Him directly.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this when I read this comment by Ruth on <a href="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/index.php/2008/12/the-12-days-of-christmas-challenge" target="_blank">The 12 Days of Christmas Challenge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok to be honest, I have been thinking about this and not praying about it. I really want to do it, but it’s so scary. I will be praying to ask if it’s what God wants of me, which now that I say that it’s kinda funny to even ask God if He wants you to do what He already told us to do in the Bible. So I’m in, but I will be praying that God will guide and direct me to where He wants me to help and give.</p></blockquote>
<p>She didn&#8217;t need a priest or pastor to reveal to her that the 12 Days of Christmas Challenge is nothing new, it&#8217;s just what God has already instructed us to do in the bible, the Holy Spirit helped her see and understand it directly.</p>
<p>You can hear from God too. You don&#8217;t need someone else to tell you what God has to say to you - He wants to talk to you personally.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that God cannot speak to you through other people. He definitely gives people things that He wants them to pass on to others - we mustn&#8217;t place limits on what God can do or how He can do it. What&#8217;s is important though is that you reaize the wonderful position that you are in, the wonderful gift that you have been given.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You have been made a child of the Most High - and who doesn&#8217;t want to have personal relationships with their children?</p>

Be prepared!</span></h3>
<p>When I started thinking about the Challenge and praying about what God wanted me to do with it, I wasn&#8217;t sure what kind of reception it would get from my church or from anyone else.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to God that I am part of an awesome church who listen to God and respond positively to Him. The Challenge was met with a little nervousness but a willingness to do what God is calling us to.</p>
<p>Even more than that though, I am so grateful that God is showing me that we are a part of a body that&#8217;s so much bigger than just our local church fellowship.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy for us to get so focused on our own churches that we lose the big picture of the whole, enormous family of God and what He is doing across the whole world.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Rediscovering the Church is all about. It&#8217;s about opening my eyes to see the wonder of the beautiful tapestry that God is weaving across this town, this state, this country, this continent, this whole world.</p>
<p>Let me explain - I put the Challenge up on this website to give you, the reader, an opportunity to join in if the Holy Spirit led you to - and guess what? HE DID!</p>
<p>It has been amazing to me how The Church has responded across America and into Canada and maybe even beyond - and even more amazing to me is the people who have felt led to pass the challenge on to their readers without me even suggesting it. Here&#8217;s just a few who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin at <a href="http://kevinmartineau.blogspot.com/2008/12/sundays-random-thoughts.html" target="_blank">Shooting the Breeze</a></li>
<li>Mike at <a href="http://churchformenflorida.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-challenge.html" target="_blank">Church for Men Florida</a></li>
<li>Jamie at <a href="http://grace-period.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Grace-period</a></li>
<li>Andy at <a href="http://thenarrowroad-andyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/here-challenge-for-you.html" target="_blank">The Narrow Road</a></li>
</ul>
<div>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve seen more, I just can&#8217;t remember where they are just now but that&#8217;s amazing! I have never met any of these people ever in my life. Never. Apart from a few blog comments and emails, they&#8217;ve never even talked to me. They don&#8217;t owe me anything and yet The Spirit is talking to them in such a way that they have decided to spread the word and challenge other people to get involved.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That&#8217;s amazing! That&#8217;s a Church which I had not previously discovered hearing from and responding to the same God even though they are thousands of miles apart. </div>
<div></div>
<div>God&#8217;s Church, our family is awesome!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanks guys.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Don&#8217;t forget to be praying about what God wants you to do as your part of the challenge, how or what He wants you to give every day - and also pray for your brothers and sisters who are getting involved that we all will learn and be changed by this experience!</span></strong></div>

<p>When we pray, we can expect an answer. It&#8217;s as simple as that. Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. (Matthew 7:7)</p></blockquote>
<p>So as you pray this week, wait for an answer, listen for the answer because the answer WILL come, maybe not exactly when you want it and maybe it won&#8217;t be exactly what you hoped it would be but the answer will come.</p>
<p>This is an easy one to memorize. See if you can have it and its reference committed to memory by the end of the week.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s finally here! The 12 Days of Christmas Challenge (12DoCC).</p>
<p>First, let me give you a very brief history of how I came to this point of setting and getting involved in the challenge.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago, we planted a church in our home and after much though, discussion and prayer we decided it should be called &#8216;<a href="http://www.hafchurch.org" target="_blank">Hands and Feet</a>&#8216;. Why? Because we believed that God was calling us to be His Hands and Feet in our community - in fact we believe that he calls ALL of us to be his hands and feet in our communities.</p>
<p>Recently God has stirred us up and awakened our hearts to the fact that we have been apathetic, we have not <em>been</em> his Hands and Feet, we&#8217;ve just talked about it a lot and occasionally we have been His checkbook.</p>
<p>He called us to seek Him and as we have been doing so I have been wondering what more could we have done? What does being His hands and feet mean? What is God asking of us?</p>
<p>The answer has resoundingly come back as simply this: <strong>die to yourselves.</strong></p>
<p>Really die to yourselves. Become living sacrifices.</p>
<p>The word sacrifice means: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sacrifice" target="_blank">the surrender or destruction of something prized or desirable for the sake of something considered as having a higher or more pressing claim</a>.</p>
<p>So what is it that is so prized or desirable that we are being asked to sacrifice? Well, everything. Everything we hold dear, our possessions, our relationships, our time, our very lives are what God calls us to sacrifice. </p>
<p>Jesus said: &#8220;If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be my disciple&#8221; (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=14&amp;verse=26&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" target="_blank">Luke 14:26</a>). </p>
<p>He&#8217;s not talking about hating in the sense that we might think of hating, He&#8217;s talking about setting them aside, dying to them and replacing the desire to be with them with a desire to serve God. Obviously we should still love them but not love them in such a way that we put them before the call of God in our lives.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul uses the term &#8216;living sacrifices&#8217; (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=52&amp;chapter=12&amp;verse=1&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" target="_blank">Romans 12:1</a>). He wants us to sacrifice ourselves, to surrender our lives, without actually physically dying. So we&#8217;re left with this concept of giving everything up but still being alive. What then do we do with our lives?</p>
<p>This is the point I had come to. What do we do? Not what do we talk about doing? What do we <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO</span></em></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Well, it took a while but, in His time, God started talking to me - and it was like a cascade! If I get the order slightly wrong, then I apologize but it happened something like this:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember exactly where it started but at some point, World AIDS Day came along and I in unison with thousands of other bloggers blogged about the AIDS epidemic to raise awareness and, while raising awareness is doing something at least, I felt like I didn&#8217;t actually DO anything to combat the spread of AIDS. </p>
<p>I realized that I was being a voice but not the hands and feet of Christ that God wants us to be.</p>
<p>Then I discovered the <a href="http://givingchallenge.ning.com/" target="_blank">29 Day Giving Challenge</a>, whose <a href="http://www.29gifts.org/origins.html" target="_blank">origins</a> are irrelevant but whose mission is to &#8216;revive the giving spirit in the world&#8217;.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, that got my mind and heart racing!</p>
<p>Then came <a href="www.careynieuwhof.com" target="_blank">Carey Nieuwhof</a> who wrote a post called &#8216;Why I can&#8217;t stand consumer Christianity&#8217; in which he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m increasingly convinced that church shopping kills disciples.  Pick a  church.  Join that mission. Stick with it. <em>Forget what it can do for your  family.  Give yourself away.</em> In that, you will find life.</p>
<p><em>Stop asking what your church can do for you and start asking what you can do  for your neighbours and friends</em> and people far from Christ. (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>I recommend visiting <a href="http://www.careynieuwhof.com" target="_blank">his blog</a> and reading the whole article.</p>
<p>Then there were other things, sometimes little things that people were saying or writing, sometimes it was online conversations such as <a href="http://chazzdaddy.blogspot.com/2008/12/this-is-question-i-have-struggled-with.html" target="_blank">this one, </a>but most of all I believe it was just the Holy Spirit speaking to me.</p>
<p>It comes down to this:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">We can only learn to be sacrificial, to die to ourselves, to step outside of human expectations and serve God instead of ourselves by just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doing it</span>. We can talk for as long as we like and will never get any closer to our goal because some things can only be learnt by experience, by action, by getting our hands dirty. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">We, the church, are supposed to be changing the world. We are supposed to be so different from other people (in a good way) that it makes people stop and wonder why. We&#8217;re supposed to love our neighbors as ourselves, we&#8217;re supposed to do good to those who hurt us, to love our enemies, to give to people who steal from us. How much of that have you ever done?</span></p>
<p>So I came up with this challenge. I believe that God gave it to me and that He wants me to share it with everyone He brings to hear/read it:</p>
<h1><span style="color: #800000;">The Challenge</span></h1>
<p>For 12 days in the run-up to Christmas, will you take the plunge, die to yourself and give sacrificially? Will you sacrifice one thing each day for God?</p>
<p>What we give sacrificially can be any of a whole multitude of things, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our time. Volunteer somewhere for an hour or two - and give up doing something else to do it.</li>
<li>Our pride. Apologize unreservedly to someone with whom you&#8217;ve had a falling out. Humble yourself and accept the blame for the situation even if you don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s your fault. Die to your pride for the sake of love.</li>
<li>Our food. I can guarantee you that there are people in your town who get to eat less than one meal a day. Find one of them and give them your meal. Miss a meal to feed someone else.</li>
<li>Our possessions. You loved yourself enough to buy it for yourself. Do you love your neighbor enough to give it to them? </li>
<li>Our money. I&#8217;m not talking about what you can put on your credit card, I&#8217;m talking about the cash in your pocket that you were going to spend on Starbucks or on a date or on flowers for the house. Sacrifice a purchase for you to give to someone else.</li>
<li>Our&#8230;&#8230; The list is endless.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me ask you this: why not give your big-screen LCD TV to someone else? Can you come up with a reason which is not selfish?</p>
<p>Or this: Why not invite a homeless person into your house for dinner? Are you worried that they might steal something? If so, are you more concerned about your possessions than about the poor and sick and needy?</p>
<p>My guess is that some of you are thinking that you&#8217;re coming up to Christmas and there&#8217;s no time and no money left to give - <em>but that&#8217;s the whole point! </em>Some of you out there will be busy already being sacrificial but most of you will be busy being&#8230; busy.</p>
<p>That first Christmas, Jesus took time out from running the entire universe to give the best thing He could possibly give - himself. <strong>Are you willing to do the same?</strong></p>
<h1><span style="color: #800000;">How it works</span></h1>
<p>Here&#8217;s my proposal: Take 5 days to prepare. Pray, Pray and Pray some more! Think about what you can do, maybe organize some days when you can volunteer somewhere. Call this week to arrange it so that you can find somewhere that needs you.</p>
<p>Then, starting <span style="color: #800000;">Saturday 12th December 2008</span>, find a way to give something every day. Open your eyes and your ears and most importantly your heart and see the need that Jesus sees - then meet that need, regardless of the personal cost to you.</p>
<p>One thing I would say is that you should not do anything that is going to hurt you. If you have a medical condition that means you have to eat every however many hours, don&#8217;t endanger your health by skipping meals. Remember &#8216;living sacrifices&#8217; - God is not interested in you killing yourself to give! Be wise, but at the same time, be obedient. If you don&#8217;t feel that you have money to give but you are sure that God tells you to give money to someone then take a leap of faith and do it! However, don&#8217;t just blindly give money you can&#8217;t afford to give without God&#8217;s prompting.</p>
<p>Hearing God&#8217;s voice is hard but it will be a whole lot easier when you are putting yourself out there and saying &#8220;Lord, what can I give today?&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to keep a running commentary on my experiences going here on this blog.Why not drop by every now and then and share through comments what God is doing in you and through you.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">This will be a life changing experience - are you ready?</span></strong></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/wp-content/uploads/cooltext4069504401.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-305 alignleft" title="The 12 Days of Christmas Challenge" src="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/wp-content/uploads/cooltext4069504401-38x300.jpg" alt="The 12 Days of Christmas Challenge" width="38" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m so excited about the people who have signed up to pray about the 12 Days of Christmas Challenge!</p>
<p>The great thing is that right now, before the challenge has even started, people are being challenged. Challenged to step outside of the ordinary, challenged to pray a different way than they might normally pray, challenged to not just talk at God but to listen to Him reply.</p>
<p>I am passionate about people not &#8216;doing&#8217; Church but <em>being</em> the Church. </p>
<p>You may not understand the difference, but the difference is huge.</p>
<p>Church has become something we &#8216;do&#8217;. We &#8216;go to&#8217; church, we know the rules of what church is and we (most of the time) stick to them. Church can often be very much about programs that we get involved in, programs that we &#8216;do&#8217;. Church can be about &#8216;doing&#8217; a whole lot of stuff.</p>
<p>As I read it though, that&#8217;s not what the bible says God wants His Church to be like. </p>
<p>God wants us to BE the Church. to live lives which are outrageously different to the rest of the world. To love 24/7, to live the gospel 24/7, to be so different that the world sees the difference and asks us about it : <em>1 Peter 3:15 &#8221;Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have&#8221; (NIV)</em> </p>
<p>The same principle goes for prayer. God doesn&#8217;t want us to be people who just throw words up to heaven, He doesn&#8217;t want us to just &#8216;do&#8217; prayer. He wants us to be people who have a relationship with Him, people for whom prayer is a two-way conversation.</p>
<p>That conversation works differently for different people. For some God seems to talk immediately, for others God seems to talk through things that happen in the day or days after the prayer. For others He speaks back through His Word, the bible. For others He speaks through other people.</p>
<p>In reality, most of us hear Him speak in all of these ways at different times (if we are listening).</p>
<p>As you are praying about whether or not God wants you to be a part of this 12 Days of Christmas Challenge, you may be praying in a way that you have never prayed before and that is AWESOME. If you get nothing else out of this, your relationship with God will have changed some&#8230;. and that&#8217;s exciting!</p>
<p>There are 3 different answers that you might receive from God about this challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>YES! I want you to take part</li>
<li>No, this is not for you at this time</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll tell you later!</li>
</ol>
<div>It may be that you don&#8217;t know what His answer is until you read what the challenge is - and that&#8217;s OK, that just means His answer was &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later&#8221;. It also means that God is speaking to you as you read, and you need to learn to recognize His voice. He&#8217;ll either stir your heart with a &#8220;yes&#8221; or close it up with a &#8220;no&#8221;. Either way, He&#8217;s speaking and it is a great time to learn what His voice sounds like!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tomorrow I will post the challenge - be prayed up and ready!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/wp-content/uploads/clocks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-298" title="It's Time!" src="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/wp-content/uploads/clocks.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="160" /></a>The time for talking is over. The time for action is now!</p>
<p>On my journey to rediscover <em>who</em> the Church are, I am finding that I am also rediscovering <em>what</em> the Church is or more specifically <em>how</em> the Church should act.</p>
<p>I could list the scriptures here if you want but I won&#8217;t. They are right there unavoidably obvious in your bible and you read them time and time again.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s just one of the many:</p>
<blockquote><p>Luke 9:23-25 Then he said to them all: &#8220;If anyone  would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow  me. For whoever wants to save his life  will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and  yet lose or forfeit his very self?</p></blockquote>
<p>So I have been thinking&#8230; what can I do? What can WE do? How do we step outside of the bounds of our lives today and live sacrificial lives? How do we die to ourselves? What can we actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>DO</em></span> rather than what can we just talk about?</p>
<p>So I have a plan, a challenge, an opportunity for you all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the 12 Days of Christmas Challenge&#8230;.</p>
<p>and here&#8217;s the first part of the challenge:</p>
<p>Will you pray about whether or not God wants you to take up the 12 Days of Christmas Challenge <strong>before</strong> you know what the challenge is?</p>
<p>Will you ask Him &#8220;Lord, is it your will for me to take up the challenge?&#8221; and will you do it if He answers yes?</p>
<p>Without knowing what the challenge is, are you prepared to commit to something just because God says He wants you to?</p>
<p>Are you willing to put aside all human reason and questions and simply respond in faith?</p>
<p>Will you pray about it tonight?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/wp-content/uploads/sistinegod.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-294" title="God(Sistine)" src="http://blog.hafchurch.org/peter/wp-content/uploads/sistinegod-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="128" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>It was written by an 8 year old, Danny Dutton of Chula Vista, CA, for his third grade homework assignment. The assignment was to explain God. Wonder if any of us could do as well?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One of God&#8217;s main jobs is making people. He makes them to replace the ones that die, so there will be enough people to take care of things on earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He doesn&#8217;t make grown-ups, just babies. I think because they are smaller and easier to make. That way He doesn&#8217;t have to take up His valuable time teaching them to talk and walk. He can just leave that to mothers and fathers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">God&#8217;s second most important job is listening to prayers. An awful lot of this goes on, since some people, like preachers and things, pray at times beside bedtime. God doesn&#8217;t have time to listen to the radio or TV because of this. Because He hears everything, there must be a terrible lot of noise in His ears, unless He has thought of a way to turn it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">God sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere which keeps Him pretty busy. So you shouldn&#8217;t go wasting His time by going over your Mom and Dad&#8217;s head asking for something they said you couldn&#8217;t have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Atheists are people who don&#8217;t believe in God. I don&#8217;t think there are any in Chula Vista. At least there aren&#8217;t any who come to our church.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jesus is God&#8217;s Son. He used to do all the hard work like walking on water and performing miracles and trying to teach the people who didn&#8217;t want to learn about God. They finally got tired of Him preaching to them and they crucified Him. But He was good and kind, like His Father and He told His Father that they didn&#8217;t know what they were doing and to forgive them and God said O.K.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">His Dad (God) appreciated everything that He had done and all His hard work on earth so He told Him He didn&#8217;t have to go out on the road anymore. He could stay in heaven. So He did. And now He helps His Dad out by listening to prayers and seeing things which are important for God to take care of and which ones He can take care of Himself without having to bother God. Like a secretary, only more important.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You can pray anytime you want and they are sure to help you because they&#8217;ve got it worked out so that one of them is on duty all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You should always go to church on Sunday because it makes God happy, and if there&#8217;s anybody you want to make happy, it&#8217;s God. Don&#8217;t skip church to do something you think will be more fun like going to the beach. This is wrong. And besides the sun doesn&#8217;t come out at the beach until noon anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you don&#8217;t believe in God, besides being an atheist, you will be very lonely, because your parents can&#8217;t go everywhere with you, like to camp, but God can. It is good to know He&#8217;s around you when you&#8217;re scared in the dark or when you can&#8217;t swim and you get thrown into real deep water by big kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But&#8230;you shouldn&#8217;t just always think of what God can do for you. I figure God put me here and He can take me back anytime He pleases.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And&#8230;that&#8217;s why I believe in God.</span></p>
