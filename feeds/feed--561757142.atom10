			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.photoshoplab.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/onone-phototools-2-pro.jpg" alt="onOne PhotoTools 2 Pro" title="onone-phototools-2-pro" width="230" height="245" class="imglt" /> Next in the line of upcoming onOne Software products is PhotoTools 2. PhotoTools is a large collection of imaging tools for use in Photoshop CS4 and Photoshop CS4 extended. Also, like the rest of the onOne Software products, coupon code <strong>PHTSHPLB</strong> saves you 10%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ononesoftware.com">onOne Software, Inc</a>., a leading developer of innovative software tools for photographers, today announced the upcoming release of PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition and PhotoTools 2 Standard Edition. PhotoTools is a flexible yet powerful plug-in for Adobe&reg; Photoshop&reg; CS4 software that utilizes the power of Photoshop CS4 and Photoshop CS4 Extended Actions to provide a wide range of imaging tools including effects, corrections and production automation in a full-featured interface.</p>
<p>Available in January 2009, PhotoTools 2 features an expanded range of photographic effects and a significantly improved user experience through a new effects library and additional new features.<span id="more-776"></span></p>
<p>&quot;The PhotoTools 2 product line builds upon the power of Photoshop to help users spend less time behind the computer enhancing their photos and more time taking pictures with their camera,&quot; said Craig Keudell, president of onOne Software. &quot;Digital photographers of all skill levels rely on programs like Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom&reg; 2 software as essential tools in communicating their photographic vision in the same way photographers used to utilize a darkroom. With PhotoTools 2, photographers can now make their photographic vision a reality easier, faster and better than ever before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Photoshop Actions have always been and continue to be a great way to simplify workflows by automating repetitive tasks,&quot; said Kevin Connor, vice president of product management for professional digital imaging at Adobe. &quot;PhotoTools 2 allows users to preview the effects of multiple Photoshop commands and is a clear example of how partners like onOne can extend the value of Photoshop.&rdquo; </p>
<p>PhotoTools 2 offers an easier way to search for, access and preview over 270 included photographic effects. For demanding users including portrait and wedding photographers, PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition offers an expanded library of over 300 photographic effects from leading Photoshop Guru Jack Davis and top tier professional wedding photographer Kevin Kubota. Users of PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition will also appreciate enhancements to their workflow with support for both Lightroom 2 and Aperture 2.1.</p>
<p><strong>New Features in PhotoTools 2</strong><br />
<strong>New Effects Library</strong> &ndash; The new Effects Library in both editions of PhotoTools 2 make it easier to choose from the collection of over 300 effects. Photographers will be given several new options for finding the perfect effect or combination of effects including:</p>
<p>&bull;	<strong>Improved Category Mode</strong> &ndash; This mode is organized in a common photographic workflow that will be familiar to photographers. Effects are organized by categories such as Image Optimization, Portrait Enhance, Landscape Enhance, Color Tints, etc. Choosing a category reveals the available effects within.</p>
<p>&bull;	<strong>New Keyword Mode</strong> &ndash; Using emotive keywords and descriptors, photographers narrow down the list of effects to just those that match their unique search criteria. For example, a photographer can click on a keyword like Black-and-White and then click on a mood descriptor such as Warm and Grainy. Effects that match those two search criteria will be displayed for the photographer, greatly improving the process of locating a type or style of effect. </p>
<p>&bull;	<strong>New Preset Mode</strong> &ndash; This new mode displays a list of presets or effects &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; that are included with PhotoTools or any presets that a photographer has created for themselves. Additionally, any presets that a photographer has downloaded for free from the onOne Exchange (http:/www.ononeexchange.com), a community site dedicated to PhotoTools users, will appear in this list as well.</p>
<p>&bull;	<strong>New Effects Preview</strong> &ndash; Knowing what an effect will do to a photo is critical in the decision making process and PhotoTools 2 provides a new preview mode that includes dozens of new before and after previews for each effect to help photographers make the best choices for communicating their vision through enhancing their photographs.</p>
<p><strong>New Photographic Effects</strong> &ndash; Designed by photographers for photographers, PhotoTools 2 includes dozens of new effects to meet the needs of today&#x27;s digital photographers. PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition expands upon the Standard Edition with additional photographic effects developed by Photoshop guru Jack Davis and professional wedding photographer Kevin Kubota.</p>
<p><strong>New Support for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 and Apple Aperture 2.1</strong> &ndash; To provide photographers using Lightroom 2 with a seamless, integrated workflow solution to go between Lightroom and Photoshop and back to Lightroom, all of the PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition presets are accessible from directly within Lightroom 2. When a photographer chooses a PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition preset from within Lightroom 2, the file will be handed directly to Photoshop where the PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition effect is applied and then returned to Lightroom 2 automatically. Photographers will benefit from this new integration as they will be able to send multiple photos to Photoshop in a single step and have all files returned to Lightroom 2 without having to edit each file individually. </p>
<p>In the same manner in which PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition supports Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2, it will also support Apple Aperture 2.1. Aperture 2.1 users who also have Photoshop CS3 or CS4 installed can employ PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition in their image editing workflow to apply any of the included 300+ photographic effects or their own custom presets </p>
<p><strong>New Masking Support</strong> &ndash; New in PhotoTools 2 will be the ability to create masks on each effect. This will allow the photographer to paint an effect in or out from directly within PhotoTools. Effects can still be sent back to Photoshop with a layer mask for future editing.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Access to the onOne Exchange</strong> &ndash; The onOne Exchange is a new community website managed by onOne Software that enables users of PhotoTools to download free presets (or combinations of effects) for their own use. Users of PhotoTools can also upload any presets that they have created in PhotoTools to be shared with other PhotoTools users. Access to this new site is built directly into the PhotoTools user interface.</p>
<p><strong>Availability and Pricing</strong><br />
PhotoTools 2 comes in two editions &ndash; a Professional Edition and a Standard Edition and are available for $259.95 and $159.95 respectively direct from onOne Software and select, authorized resellers in the United States and around the world. Upgrades from PhotoTools 1 to PhotoTools 2 are available for only $99.95.</p>
<p>Both PhotoTools 2 Professional Edition and PhotoTools 2 Standard Edition may be pre-ordered from onOne Software today and available through the worldwide network of authorized resellers in January 2009. Customers who pre-order PhotoTools 2 will initially receive PhotoTools 1 and then receive a free upgrade to PhotoTools 2.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.photoshoplab.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/onone-genuine-fractals-6.jpg" alt="onOne Genuine Fractals 6" title="onone-genuine-fractals-6" width="230" height="246" class="imglt" align="left" /> Not to be left behind, <a href="http://www.ononesoftware.com/">onOne Software</a> is on top of the game by announcing Genuine Fractals 6 for Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Adobe Lightroom 2. The new version of Genuine Fractals will be available this November for your plug-in pleasure. (Psst, coupon code <strong>PHTSHPLB</strong> saves you 10%). You can check out the whole press release after the jump.</p>
<p><span id="more-774"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ononesoftware.com">onOne Software, Inc</a>., a leading developer of innovative software tools for photographers, today announced Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition and Genuine Fractals 6 Standard Edition. Genuine Fractals 6 adds several new features designed to help photographers get the best enlargements possible. These new features include texture presets, a new gallery wrap function, batch processing, tiling for smaller printers and support for Adobe&reg; Photoshop&reg; CS4, Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom&reg; 2.</p>
<p>Available in November, Genuine Fractals 6 represents onOne Software&#x27;s continuing commitment to provide photographers with the industry standard for resizing images with no loss in image quality and sharpness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.ononesoftware.com/products/genuine_fractals.php">Genuine Fractals</a> has been the go-to application of professional photographers for high-quality image resizing for over a decade,&rdquo; said Craig Keudell, president of onOne Software. &ldquo;Due to significant improvements in digital cameras enjoyed by photographers and ready access to large format printers, it&rsquo;s become more important then ever to improve the feature set and functionality of Genuine Fractals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A key strength of Photoshop is that it provides users with many choices on how to complete any task, so that you can always find the best tool for the job,&rdquo; said Kevin Connor, vice president of product management for professional digital imaging at Adobe. &ldquo;When it comes to the common task of resizing images, Genuine Fractals further expands those choices so that customers can be assured of getting the best results.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>New Features in Genuine Fractals 6</strong><br />
<strong>Texture Presets</strong> &ndash; Genuine Fractals 6 now includes texture presets allowing photographers to get the most out of the patented resizing algorithm that powers Genuine Fractals. The presets are designed to give users an easy way to set the key algorithm parameters to get the highest quality enlargement based on the type of image the user is starting out with no matter the size or subject matter.</p>
<p><strong>New Gallery Wrap Feature</strong> &ndash; Photographers are often faced with losing part of their subject when some of the image is wrapped around the thick frames used to create canvas gallery wrap prints. With Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition, photographers have an easy way to increase the edge areas of the image by reflecting or stretching the margins to allow for canvas wrapping without having to sacrifice important details in the image.</p>
<p><strong>New Batch Processing</strong> &ndash; Photographers who need to resize multiple images can now do so in a very efficient workflow thanks to the new Batch Processing feature in Genuine Fractals 6. Based on the Batch Processing Engine developed initially for onOne Software&rsquo;s PhotoTools Professional Edition, photographers can choose which files to resize, change file names, save files to a new location and file type, change and embed a specific color space to the new file and optionally add a customized watermark to help protect the photographers work.</p>
<p><strong>Tiling for Smaller Printers</strong> &ndash; This new tiling feature allows photographers to resize their images to any desired size and then have Genuine Fractals 6 create the necessary documents so that the image can be printed on a smaller format printer. For example if the photographers desired output size is 24&quot; x 30&quot; but their printer can only print a maximum size of 8&quot; x 10&quot; they can use the new tiling feature to break the final 24&quot; x 30&quot; file into a matrix of nine 8&quot; x 10&quot; images that are returned as separate files in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Support for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 and Apple Aperture 2.1</strong> &ndash; In addition to support for Adobe Photoshop CS4, Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition will also support Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 and Apple Aperture 2.1 putting the industry standard for image resizing inside these photography workflow applications.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Enhancements</strong> &ndash; Several other features of Genuine Fractals have been improved including the document size presets which make resizing and cropping to fit much easier; an improved crop tool that allows photographers to define a crop in any direction as well as additional user experience improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Availability and Pricing</strong><br />
Genuine Fractals 6 comes in two editions &ndash; a Professional Edition and a Standard Edition and are available for $299.95 and $159.95 respectively direct from onOne Software and select, authorized resellers in the United States and around the world. Upgrades from previous versions of Genuine Fractals are available for $99.95. Genuine Fractals 6 is also available as part of Plug-In Suite 4, an integrated suite of six plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop Elements, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 and Apple Aperture 2.1.</p>
<p>Genuine Fractals 6 does not support the 64-bit version of Photoshop CS4 for Windows but does support the 32-bit versions of Photoshop CS4 for both Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>Genuine Fractals 6 may be pre-ordered immediately from onOne Software at <a href="http://www.ononesoftware.com">www.ononesoftware.com</a> and will be available through the worldwide network of authorized resellers in early December 2008. Customers who pre-order Genuine Fractals 6 will receive a copy of Genuine Fractals 5 initially and then will receive a free upgrade to Genuine Fractals 6.

I highly suggest checking out those places to get you started looking like a CS4 pro right when the boxes land on your doorstep.</p>
<p>Check out the full CS4 shipping press release after the jump.<span id="more-767"></span></p>
<p>SAN JOSE, Calif. &mdash; Oct. 15, 2008 &mdash; Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the immediate availability of the Adobe&reg; Creative Suite&reg; 4 product family, the highly-anticipated release of industry-leading design and development software for virtually every creative workflow. Delivering radical breakthroughs in workflow efficiency &ndash; and packed with hundreds of innovative, time saving features &ndash; the new Creative Suite 4 product line advances the creative process across print, Web, interactive, film, video and mobile. </p>
<p>Customers can choose from six new versions: Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium, Design Standard, Web Premium, Web Standard, Production Premium and Master Collection. The combination of Creative Suite and the new capabilities of Adobe Flash&reg; Player 10, also available today (see separate press release) deliver new levels of creativity and expressiveness across media channels. Designers using the Adobe Creative Suite 4 product family will gain unprecedented creative control using the new expressive features and visual performance improvements in Adobe Flash Player 10 to deliver breakthrough Web experiences across multiple browsers and operating systems. &ldquo;Creative Suite 4 and Flash Player 10 introduce vital time-saving features, new levels of integration and the jaw- dropping innovations our design and developer customers expect from us,&rdquo; said John Loiacono, senior vice president, Creative Solutions Business Unit at Adobe. &ldquo;CS4 continues to fulfill our promise to customers to break down more barriers in cross-media workflows, while also providing new services and collaboration tools that help them manage complex client demands.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As part of the CS4 product launch, the largest in Adobe&rsquo;s history, also available today are brand new versions of Photoshop&reg; CS4, Photoshop CS4 Extended, InDesign&reg; CS4, Illustrator&reg; CS4, Flash CS4 Professional, Dreamweaver&reg; CS4, Fireworks&reg; CS4, Contribute&reg; CS4, After Effects&reg; CS4, Adobe Premiere&reg; Pro CS4, Encore&reg; CS4, Soundbooth&reg; CS4 and Adobe OnLocation&trade; CS4.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive Workflows Improve Creative Efficiency</strong><br />
A simplified workflow in Adobe Creative Suite 4 enables users to design across media more efficiently by making it easier to complete common tasks and move content seamlessly among applications. InDesign CS4 includes a new Live Preflight tool that allows designers to catch production errors and a newly customizable Links panel to manage placed files more efficiently. The revolutionary new Content-Aware Scaling tool in Photoshop CS4 and Photoshop CS4 Extended automatically recomposes an image as it is resized, preserving vital areas as it adapts to new dimensions. An expanded version of Dynamic Link in CS4 Production Premium enables users to move and update content between After Effects CS4, Adobe Premiere Pro CS4, Soundbooth CS4, and Encore CS4 without rendering, saving countless hours in production. With deep XMP metadata support, the production workflow is simplified, resulting in online content that gives viewers new ways to interact with and search for video, while giving content owners new      opportunities to track and monetize content.</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Suite 4 brings 3D center-stage providing the ability to paint, composite, and animate 3D models using familiar tools in Photoshop CS4 Extended. Flash CS4 Professional now offers the ability to apply tweens to objects instead of keyframes, providing greater control over animation attributes. Also in Flash CS4 Professional, the new Bones tool helps create more realistic animations between linked objects. With a searchable library of more than 450 dynamically updated device profiles from leading manufacturers, Adobe Device Central CS4 enables users to easily test mobile content designed using many of the Creative Suite 4 products. </p>
<p><strong>New and Expanded Services Extend Capabilities for Online Collaboration</strong><br />
Adobe Creative Suite 4 now also offers a host of services* for online collaboration. Adobe ConnectNow, a service of Acrobat.com, allows real-time collaboration with two colleagues or clients. Designers can also share color harmonies with Adobe Kuler&trade;. Other online resources include: Adobe Community Help for technical questions; Resource Central for accessing video and audio product-related news and tutorials, as well as Soundbooth scores and sound effects; and Adobe Bridge Home, a customizable resource for tips, tutorials, news and inspirational content. </p>
<p><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong><br />
Adobe Creative Suite 4 and its associated point products are immediately available through Adobe Authorized Resellers and the Adobe Store at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/store">www.adobe.com/store</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.photoshoplab.com/instantly-save-10-on-the-new-versions-of-photoframe-use-coupon-code-phtshplb.html"><img src="http://www.photoshoplab.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/onone-photoframe-4.jpg" alt="onOne PhotoFrame 4" title="onOne PhotoFrame 4" width="230" height="246" class="imglt" /></a>onOne Software, Inc., a leading developer of innovative software tools for photographers, today announces two significant upgrades to their award-winning applications for adding the <a href="http://www.ononesoftware.com/products/photoframe.php">perfect finishing touch to digital photos - PhotoFrame 4 Professional and Standard Editions</a>.</p>
<p>Now supporting Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 software, the photographer&#x27;s essential toolbox for managing, adjusting and presenting large volumes of digital photographs, the PhotoFrame 4 plugin helps photographers of all skill levels to quickly and easily create one-of-a-kind works of art with their images. PhotoFrame 4 adds details once mastered only in the darkroom like unique edge effects, frames, borders, adornments and texture overlays. Expanding upon onOne Software&#x27;s award-winning plug-in for Adobe Photoshop software, PhotoFrame 4 delivers hundreds of new frames, including exclusive content from professional wedding photographers Kevin Kubota and Vicki Taufer, that today&#x27;s digital photographers are demanding for their professional and personal work.<span id="more-763"></span></p>
<p>PhotoFrame 4 also includes a new easy-to-use frame library with new library management options, updated user-interface, cutting-edge new content, new output options for added user control, and more.</p>
<p>&quot;PhotoFrame has long been the choice of professional and advanced amateur photographers that want to add unique and creative details to their digital photos,&quot; said Craig Keudell, president of onOne Software. &quot;With PhotoFrame 4 Professional and Standard Editions, we&#x27;ve raised the bar even higher by extending the flexibility and functionality and adding high-quality content that is relevant for today&#x27;s demanding digital photographers whether they use Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom 2.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While photographers are thrilled with Lightroom and the efficiencies of a digital workflow, their images are still art and options for adding realistic edges or borders, as they would have done in the darkroom, are a consistent request,&quot; said Tom Hogarty, Lightroom Product Manager &quot;It&#x27;s great to see PhotoFrame 4 Professional Edition bring this functionality in an easy to use manner to Lightroom 2.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;PhotoFrame has always been the solution I&#x27;ve used to recreate the authentic look of the darkroom for my digital images and montages,&quot; said Jim DiVitale, professional photographer and Photoshop instructor. &quot;With PhotoFrame 4 Professional Edition, onOne Software has added even more authentic content and made it even easier to use by allowing users to resize and adjust multiple frame layers at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have always tried to share with my students techniques that give them the best possible results, with the greatest amount of control, with the least amount of steps: &#x27;Quality, Flexibility &amp; Speed&#x27; is my mantra,&quot; said Jack Davis, Photoshop Hall-of-Famer and author of the best-selling Wow and How to Wow book series. &quot;With the release of PhotoFrame 4 Professional Edition, I am one hundred percent comfortable recommending it as THE time-saving solution for creating the highest quality border and edge effects with a truly incredible amount of creative control. I love it!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>New Features in PhotoFrame 4</strong><br />
New Frame Library - The new Library window in PhotoFrame 4 lets users easily search, browse and preview frames, backgrounds, textures and adornments on their image in real time. Users can immediately see just what each frame selection will look like with their image. A new streamlined light table style view allows users to search and sort frames quickly. With the improved preview quality users can zoom in and choose the best frame for every photo.</p>
<p>New Library Management Options - New in PhotoFrame 4 is the ability to change the location of the frame library. Photographers can choose the drive and location and even automatically relocate the library later if needed. In addition, photographers who create and add their own frames can have them automatically added to the PhotoFrame 4 Library making them easier to find in the future.</p>
<p>New &amp; Optimized Content - New cutting-edge content has been added to onOne Software&#x27;s PhotoFrame 4 allowing photographers to add an exciting and modern look to their photos and albums. The new content includes more realistic film edges along with new texture overlays, backgrounds and adornments. Additionally, the frame content in PhotoFrame 4 has been completely re-mastered providing photographers with a higher quality preview when choosing the best frame for their photo.</p>
<p>New Output Options - The new options palette allows photographers to control how the frames are applied to their photo. Frames, overlays and adornments can be added to the current layer, or a new layer. In addition, frames can be rendered to their own layer allowing for further adjustments or editing in Adobe Photoshop software. Frames from PhotoFrame 4 can even be applied as a layer mask allowing photographers to selectively blend multiple layers together. The output quality of frames in PhotoFrame 4 has been improved for large images and the on-screen preview even displays the layer options just like they will appear in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Integration - Photographers using Lightroom 2 can easily access their favorite frames, overlays and adornments from within Lightroom 2. Photographers can apply a preset to a single photo or an entire batch of photos. They can even open one photo to adjust the frame settings and then apply it to a selection of additional images. The integration between Lightroom 2 and PhotoFrame 4 Professional Edition requires Photoshop CS2 or Photoshop CS3.</p>
<p>Resizing and Adjusting Multiple Frames - PhotoFrame 4 allows photographers to mix, match and combine up to 32 frames together in layers just like in Photoshop. With PhotoFrame 4, photographers can select multiple frame layers and adjust their size, orientation, rotation angle, opacity and more in a single step. Additionally, the background image layer can now be adjusted separately to fit perfectly within the combination of edge effects being added.</p>
<p><strong>Availability and Pricing</strong><br />
PhotoFrame 4 comes in two variations - a Professional Edition and a Standard Edition and are available for $259.95 and $159.95 respectively direct from onOne Software and select, authorized resellers in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The Professional Edition of PhotoFrame 4 includes all of the functionality of the Standard Edition and adds additional frame, edge and adornment content from some of the top wedding photographers and Photoshop gurus in the industry as well as support for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 and Apple Aperture 2.1.</p>
<p>Both editions of PhotoFrame 4 will be available for electronic download direct from onOne Software and from authorized resellers in DVD format in early to mid October 2008.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.photoshoplab.com/think-tank-photo-helps-hide-your-expensive-equipment-with-the-urban-disguise-35.html"><img src="http://www.photoshoplab.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ud35_2.jpg" alt="Urban Disguise 35" title="Urban Disguise 35" width="230" height="160" class="imglt" /></a>If you worry about that big &#8220;check out this photography bag I have that&#8217;s probably full of some very expensive electronics&#8221; target you&#8217;ve been slinging around on your back, then check out Think Tank Photo&#8217;s Urban Disguise 35. It&#8217;s a bag designed to be useful and inconspicuous, while trying to relieve some of your anxiety about traveling around with thousands of dollars of your equipment in one, small, compact space.</p>
<p>You can check out the full press release below.<span id="more-753"></span></p>
<p>Think Tank Photo&#8217;s new Urban Disguise&trade; 35 shoulder bag is the perfect size for photographers on the go: it holds up to a 13.3&#8243; laptop with a standard-size DSLR or up to a 10&#8243; laptop with a Pro-size DSLR with lens attached. It features a large opening for easy access to equipment, attaches to a roller, and can be used as a backpack with the Shoulder Harness (sold separately). </p>
<p>Its features include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Holds multiple lenses and accessories  </li>
<li>Center Divider separates laptop from camera gear </li>
<li>Can be carried like a backpack with optional Shoulder Harness </li>
<li>Front Pocket holds an additional Pro-size DSLR body </li>
<li>Can carry DSLR with 70-200 2.8 lens attached</li>
</ul>
<p>
Like all of the Urban Disguise models, this new shoulder bag is designed to allow photographers to travel in style while protecting their valuable equipment from prying eyes.  They are intentionally designed not to look like camera bags, thus allowing photographers to carry even their larger lenses and laptops into potentially perilous settings.  They are specifically designed for Digital SLRs and for holding the bag close to the photographer&#8217;s body.   </p>
<p>&ldquo;This design concept is the culmination of years of observation of photojournalists and other photographers who have jury-rigged their bags to decrease their public exposure,&rdquo; said Think Tank Photo founder and lead designer Doug Murdoch. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether you are a professional who wishes to maintain a lower profile in potentially dangerous situations or a serious amateur who wishes to lessen the risk of having your gear ripped off, the Urban Disguise&#8217;s low profile design allows you to carry the right gear with less fear.&rdquo;  </p>
<h4>Urban Disguise Sales to Support Reporters Without Borders</h4>
<p>Think Tank Photo is dedicating a percentage of U.S. sales of  Urban Disguise shoulder bags to Reporters Without Borders USA.  Reporters Without Borders has fought for press freedom on a daily basis since it was founded in 1985. </p>
<p>Lucie Morillon of Reporters Without Borders USA said, &ldquo;Think Tank Photo is using this campaign to show its support of press freedom and concern about the dangers facing journalists by dedicating a portion of the proceeds from the bags sales to the international press freedom organization. By buying Urban Disguise bags reporters will not only treat themselves to some great camera bags, but also show their solidarity with colleagues around the globe who risk their lives daily to get at the truth.  Funds raised on behalf of Reporters Without Borders will help the  organization pursue its activities in support of journalists, and improve their safety.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Donations to Reporters Without Borders can be made at <a href="http://www.rsf.org">http://www.rsf.org</a>. </p>
