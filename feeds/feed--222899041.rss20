<description>&#60;p&#62;ok, thx. downloaded, installed, activated, put the widget into the sidebar seems ok. haven't got the time right now to thoroughly test, but looks good so far.

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Everyone and thanks a lot for your feedback!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We just pushed the corrected new version to the plugin page! We've improved a lot of things and it should now be working in more cases/configurations!&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Please, let us know if you have any problem!&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Guys,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't know how to reach you directly... so I am doing it here!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We are currently testing a new version and since you guys had some problems with Notifixious we thought that maybe you'd like to test this new version. If so, please download it here : &#60;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/notifixious_files/notifixious-plugin_beta.zip&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://s3.amazonaws.com/notifixious_files/notifixious-plugin_beta.zip&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Your feedback will be greatly appreciated!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks a lot for your help!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Julien

<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Ovidiu. Your post was actually pretty helpful! We're still looking for the reason why you got this error message but we've nailed some of the other problems. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'll keep you posted!

<description>&#60;p&#62;well, I don't think I could be anymore specific.&#60;br /&#62;
I uploaded the plugin, activated it and after that I got the error message I have pasted above. I couldn't access the blog backend neither the frontend as  I was getting that same error from above.

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My name is Julien and I work for Notifixious. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;First of all, I'd like to say I am sorry so many of you had problems using our plugin and we are taking measure to fix any problems you could have meet. It was our first plugin and the testing we made was obviously not &#34;large&#34; enough in terms of different configurations.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Could you please be a little bit more specific on the various error messages that you guys receive? Specially, to you have XML in your PHP?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks a lot!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Julien

<description>&#60;p&#62;Same here -- the plugin completely broke my blog (couldn't get into the admin interface, couldn't load any pages), and I had to FTP in to delete the plugin folder entirely.

<description>&#60;p&#62;Multiple error messages. Conflicts with WP Automatic Upgrade plug in. Ditto on the difficult removal. Required several tries at manual delete.
