			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year we reported that Ubisoft faced with problems with the DRM on Rainbox 6: Vegas 2, and released a fix - in the form of a no-CD crack actually created by warez group. Following on from this bad experience, Ubisoft has just released the PC version of Prince of Persia without DRM, but expect piracy to be high.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/princeofpersia.jpg" align="right" alt="prince of persia" />Ubisoft haven&#8217;t had much luck with DRM (Digital Rights Management) in 2008. First off it was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2008/04/14/assassins-creed-on-the-pc-bad-ui-bad-drm-bad-port">criticized</a> for the copy protection it embedded in its title Assassins Creed. Apparently the game tried to &#8216;phone home&#8217;, continually trying to access a Ubisoft server while the host PC was connected to the Internet. But the red faces didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>Faced with technical issues surrounding the DRM on the PC version of Rainbow Six Vegas 2, developer Ubisoft made a &#8216;fix&#8217; available. Unfortunately, it became clear that far from being their own code, the patch was actually a &#8216;<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ubisofts-no-cd-answer-to-drm-080718/">No-CD crack</a>&#8216; created by warez group, Reloaded.</p>
<p>Getting caught pirating in an attempt fix broken anti-piracy measures was probably a step too far for Ubisoft, so it has taken the radical step of removing the DRM from the PC retail version of its latest &#8216;<a href="http://www.princeofpersiagame.com/">Prince of Persia</a>&#8216; game.</p>
<p>Posting on the company&#8217;s forum, Ubisoft community development manager Chris Easton <a href="http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/861108132/m/6971093507?r=6721096017#6721096017">announced</a> the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You`re right when you say that when people want to pirate the game they will, but DRM is there to make it as difficult as possible for pirates to make copies of our games. A lot of people complain that DRM is what forces people to pirate games but as PoP [Prince of Persia] PC has no DRM we`ll see how truthful people actually are.&#8221;</p>
<p>But does Chris really expect that dropping the DRM will be a success? How &#8216;truthful&#8217; will people be when it comes to not pirating the title?</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very, I imagine,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>One user of the forum responds, &#8220;Did anyone here mention how devs blame piracy for everything these days? If the game sucks to begin with, they blame piracy. If they don&#8217;t have money or are just lazy to make a decent PC port&#8230;they blame piracy.&#8221; He finishes up with a common statement - If you make a good game, people will buy it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well this time we&#8217;ve got a good game with no DRM so there really is no reason to pirate it, right? We should expect good sales because there&#8217;s no reason to not buy a copy,&#8221; notes Chris, although he doesn&#8217;t seem <em>that</em> confident overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fairly skeptical as it&#8217;s an easy answer given by a lot of people why they pirate games but if you&#8217;re going to buy this game instead of pirating purely because of no DRM in the store version, then if I ever meet you in real life I&#8217;ll happily shake your hand and buy you a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just recently, developer <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">2D Boy</a> released their &#8216;World of Goo&#8217; without DRM. It was heavily pirated, but sales were high enough to make the project worthwhile. At the time, TorrentFreak spoke with Kyle Gabler from 2D Boy who told us that he believed that their customers realized that the company was trying to do &#8220;the right thing&#8221; which they hoped would translate into a certain amount of goodwill.</p>
<p>If the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/spore-most-pirated-game-ever-thanks-to-drm-080913/">backlash</a> linked to the terrible DRM included with Spore is anything to go by, Kyle might be on to something and time will tell if Ubisoft&#8217;s experiment pays off too. In the end, games always will be pirated, with or without DRM, and there is no reason to believe that piracy increases when there is no &#8216;protection&#8217;. In fact, it only annoys legitimate customers who bought the game.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak will count the downloads and report back in a little while&#8230;..</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2008 moves toward its end, we have been taking a a look at the most pirated titles in various categories. Following our Top 10 games post where &#8216;Spore&#8217; headlined, we now take a look at movies. Unsurprisingly, The Dark Knight comes out on top, with the rest of the chart featuring a few surprising entries, and some unexpected absentees.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/dark-knight-bittorrent.jpg" align="right" alt="the dark knight" />Mirroring its success at the box office, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a> is leading this list of 2008&#8217;s most pirated movies on BitTorrent. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the sequel to &#8216;Batman Begins&#8217; holds the record for the best opening week and weekend in movie history, and has grossed close to a <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=darkknight.htm">billion dollars</a> worldwide. </p>
<p>The film&#8217;s success doesn&#8217;t stop at the box office either. Earlier this week the DVD was released, and on the first day in stores <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/12/dvd-sales-not-r.html">3 million copies</a> were sold in the United States, Canada and the UK.</p>
<p>Alongside these impressive real-world sales, the film beat the competition on BitTorrent and other filesharing networks too. With more than 7 million downloads on BitTorrent alone, The Dark Knight now holds the title of most pirated movie of 2008. Comments on various BitTorrent sites reveal that many downloaders obtained an illegal copy after they had already watched the movie in the movie theater.</p>
<p>As with every other blockbuster, &#8216;The Dark Knight&#8217; was leaked onto the Internet in various formats. It began right after the premiere in July with a cammed version, which was <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-promotes-the-dark-knight-leak-080725/">celebrated</a> by the folks from The Pirate Bay. The &#8216;cam&#8217; was followed by a DVD-screener in early September, and a DVD in November. The latter release turned out to be the most popular among filesharers.</p>
<p>As we look over the rest of the top 10, we see that there are quite a few differences between popularity at the box office, and on filesharing networks. &#8216;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&#8217;, for example, came in second at the box office, but only came in 30th place in the download chart. On the contrary, &#8216;The Bank Job&#8217; is the third most pirated movie on BitTorrent, but just 66th at the box office.</p>
<p>The data for this list is collected by TorrentFreak from several sources, including reports from all the large BitTorrent trackers. All formats, including cammed versions are counted, and based on previous experience a correction is made for smaller .torrent releases that we might have missed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PiratPartiet, the Swedish Pirate Party, has started its march on Brussels with a bang. The party hopes to make a strong showing in June at the European Parliament elections, and has been bolstered in its aims by comments in major Swedish newspapers, which have termed the party “a classic civil rights movement.”</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/piratpartiet.png" align="right" alt="pirate parties" />It was almost three years ago that the first <a href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/international/english">Pirate Party</a> was formed in Sweden. Its aim is to deal with over-reaching copyright law, and this is exactly what the Pirate Party stands for in most people&#8217;s minds. But there is more.</p>
<p>In recent times, the Pirate Party has been more concerned with government actions that affect ordinary citizens. The <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/swedes-massively-protest-wiretap-law-080707/"> wiretapping law</a> (FRA) for example, as well as the likes of <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/sweden-to-introduce-controversial-anti-piracy-law-081023/">IPRED</a>, which will give companies chasing an alleged copyright infringer more powers than the police. Worrying for anyone that has followed our stories on <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tag/davenport-lyons/">Davenport Lyons</a> in the UK. “If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights" target="_blank">IPRED</a> becomes law, then drug dealers will have greater rights and protection than file-sharers,” <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmill.se%2Fartikel%2F2008%2F11%2F26%2Fknarklangare-har-storre-rattigheter-fildelare&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">wrote</a> one news site.</p>
<p>On Monday, the PiratPartiet <a href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/piratpartiets_kandidater_till_eu_parlamentet" target="_blank">released</a> their list of candidates for the EU parliamentary election taking place in June. Heading the list is party vice-chairman Christian Engstrom, but the other 19 candidates cover a wide age-range and are of roughly equal gender. This is not a party dominated by geeky teenage boys, but one that&#8217;s growing quickly; the Swedish Pirate Party now has only a few hundred members less than the Green Party.</p>
<p>Other countries aren&#8217;t so lucky. Spain, Poland and France, are among those with parties that hope to run in the election, but are having difficulty getting supporters. “It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs globally,” says Andrew Norton, the coordinator of <a href="http://www.pp-international.net/" target="_blank">Pirate Party International</a>. “Most countries have lots of people that just can&#8217;t be bothered. They will post on forums to express their anger, but not do anything worthwhile about it.”</p>
<p>However, in Sweden - the home of The Pirate Bay - things are getting better. In the prominent Swedish newspaper, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svenska_Dagbladet" target="_blank">Svenska Dagbladet</a>, the headline reads “IPRED Favours the Pirate Party.” It <a href="http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_2173435.svd" target="_blank">goes on</a> to comment on how directives like IPRED are driving people to the Pirate Party in Sweden, people who are concerned over both IPRED and FRA laws. </p>
<p>In their <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/swedish-elections-the-pirate-party-sails-on/">first election</a> The Swedish Pirate Party gathered some 35,000 votes – roughly comparable to a leading 3rd party candidate in a US presidential election, percentage-wise. But, with the heavy public focus on these hot-topic issues, it&#8217;s entirely possible they&#8217;ll reach 100,000 – the number required in the last EU election in Sweden to get a seat.</p>
<p>The newspaper closed with a comment from political scientist and election researcher Henrik Oscarsson, who identified the Pirate Party as “a classic civil rights movement”. We have to wonder, does this make Brokep and Co. at the Pirate Bay, the digital Rosa Parks?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year a Danish court ordered the ISP &#8216;Tele2&#8242; to block its customers from accessing The Pirate Bay. The appeal of this initial ruling was lost two weeks ago, but the case is far from over. Tele2 has decided to appeal the decision before the Supreme Court, supported by Denmark&#8217;s telecommunications industry association.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/tpb.jpg" align="right" alt="pirate bay" />The case in question is a unique one that has already generated a heated debate on the liabilities of Internet service providers. According to the court&#8217;s decision, Tele2 was infringing copyright on a grand scale, because users were transferring pirated material, copied (like all traffic) via the ISP&#8217;s routers.</p>
<p>Consequently the court <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-blocked-by-isp-080204/">ruled</a> that access to The Pirate Bay had to be blocked. Tele2 appealed this decision, but <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/isp-must-continue-to-block-the-pirate-bay-081126/">lost again</a> two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The court case was initiated by the IFPI - the infamous anti-piracy organization that represents the recording industry. The IFPI later tried to use the &#8220;landmark decision&#8221; to force Swedish ISPs to do the same, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/swedish-isp-refuses-to-block-pirate-bay-080327/">but failed</a>. In fact, it seems that filtering traffic to The Pirate Bay is actually <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/danish-pirate-bay-block-breaks-eu-law-080213/">illegal</a> according to European law.</p>
<p>The fight is not over yet though. Since this case could have huge implications for other ISPs and websites, Tele2 has announced that it will take it all the way to the Supreme Court. Fortunately for them, they won&#8217;t be alone either. They are <a href="http://www.computerworld.dk/art/49367">backed by</a> the telecommunications industry association. Jens Ottosen, president of the association told Computerworld that, if this decision is upheld, Danish ISPs might be forced to block other sites as well. </p>
<p>In a response, Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak: &#8220;We&#8217;re confident that Tele2 will win in the Supreme Court, when they [<em>the court</em>] really dig into the technology and try to understand the whole concept. It&#8217;s important for net neutrality and it&#8217;s also important for file sharers in Denmark to have this tried (and won).&#8221;</p>
<p>When the appeal is successful, The Pirate Bay will <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-ifpi-compensation-080415/">claim damages</a> from IFPI. &#8220;I hope that they [<em>Tele2</em>] win so we can demand retribution from IFPI.&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;As I&#8217;ve stated earlier we would like them to have to pay damages to us. In that case we would help set up a fund for Danish aspiring musicians that in turn would release music using a Creative Commons license.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court still has to accept the appeal before the case can go on. Despite the outcome, blocking The Pirate Bay didn’t have the effect that the IFPI was hoping for. On the contrary, traffic from Denmark went up, instead of down. However, this case is about more than just The Pirate Bay, it is about censoring the Internet.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In these credit-crunching times, many people are trying to raise extra money. Some people clear out the garage and have a sale, while others drop their unwanted items on eBay. If your purchases are digital in nature, don&#8217;t worry. A new site has appeared where you can sell your unwanted MP3s.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/bopaboologo.jpg" align="right" alt="Bopaboo" />Times are tough right now. Unemployment is rising, many businesses are in serious trouble and it looks like Christmas spending will leave little for retailers to be cheerful about either.</p>
<p>With credit becoming more difficult to acquire and future potential for funds looking less than healthy, many people are looking for second and third jobs. Those that have no time may consider selling items in order to raise extra funds, but for those whose unwanted items are digital rather than physical, options have been limited - until now. Enter <a href="http://www.bopaboo.com/">Bopaboo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/bopaboo.jpg" alt="Bopaboo" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Got a few unwanted MP3&#8217;s cluttering your hard drive? Accidentally bought the same track, two, three, four times or received a duplicate song as a gift? Don&#8217;t worry! Offload your unwanted MP3s at Bopaboo and delight in all the extra cash and hard drive space you just created. It&#8217;s a win-win-win situation. So how does it work?</p>
<p>Currently in <a href="https://www.bopaboo.com/register">private-beta</a> to United States-based users, Bopaboo seems easy to use. According to the site, after registering the user is given his very own MP3 store. Here he simply uploads his unwanted MP3s (no DRM allowed) and selects the sales price. The user can upload as many MP3s as he likes, there is no limit. Bopaboo handles the order taking and payment processing and as soon as a buyer buys an MP3, the site transfers the file to the customer and the money to the seller.</p>
<p>Of course, Bopaboo has to make its money, and it does so by taking a percentage of the sales price. Initially, money is placed in the user&#8217;s &#8216;bopaBank&#8217; but it is available for withdrawal or further purchases on Bopaboo.</p>
<p>Potential buyers can search in all the usual ways, with a feedback and seller rating system to help with choosing a supplier. Tracks can be purchased for as little as $0.25 each and major credit cards are accepted.</p>
<p>Bopaboo state that their service is completely legal with their tagline - &#8220;Stop illegally sharing and start legally selling!&#8221; In their <a href="http://www.bopaboo.com/faq">FAQ</a> they further state that &#8220;Unlike, peer-to-peer file networks - bopaboo never creates duplicates of your music.&#8221; We contacted Bopaboo and asked for more information but they haven&#8217;t responded so far.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, I&#8217;m off to see how much space I can clear on a couple of 500gig hard drives - these MP3s are simply gathering dust and this Bopaboo opportunity is too good to miss. <a href="http://www.paganiautomobili.it/">Decisions</a>, <a href="http://www.bugatti.com/en/veyron-16.4.html">decisions</a>&#8230;&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common criticism leveled at most p2p clients is that they just ‘help people steal’, but they are actually a great tool to help promote undiscovered artists. This is exactly what FrostWire is trying to accomplish with their new FrostClick service. The results from their first featured artist are very promising.</p>
<p>One of the most common suggestions for artists to make money is to distribute tracks for free as a sampler, and earn money through value-added services like concerts or CDs with physical bonuses. While this is a potentially viable business model for established artists like Radiohead and <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/nins-donation-model-doesnt-work-for-most-artists-081025/">Nine Inch Nails</a>, the small or just-starting artist can find it hard to generate a big enough buzz.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where sites like <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/jamendo-download-thousands-of-free-and-legal-music-albums-070831/">Jamendo</a> and last.fm come in. Often they work in a relational way - “you like this, so we think you&#8217;ll like this&#8230;” - and can draw a number of new fans. However, it&#8217;s rare for peer-to-peer clients themselves to start promoting artists directly, but that&#8217;s what <a href="http://frostwire.com">FrostWire</a> has done.</p>
<p>Through their new welcome screen, FrostWire users were <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2008/11/26/sean-fournier-oh-mya-great-free-album/" target="_blank"> offered</a> the 6-track album “Oh My” from <a href="http://www.wikimusicguide.com/Sean_Fournier" target="_blank">Sean Fournier</a> for download via BitTorrent. To make things even easier, streaming versions were also available to play, so the music could be sampled without even using the torrent. The key here is the simplicity. With one click, the songs could be played. With another click, the torrent for the songs was launched in the client, and the tracks downloaded.</p>
<div>
<h5>FrostWire Promoting Sean Fournier</h5>
</div>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/frostwire-click.jpg" alt="frostwire" /></p>
<p>The question that first comes to mind is: Was it a success? Well, in the first weekend, there were over 25,000 downloads according to the FrostClick site. Now, there are over 32,000 completed, and over 1 terabyte of data transferred via BitTorrent. While it&#8217;s no longer being promoted, and due to the limited reach and knowledge of the torrent (to FrostWire users), the growth is still impressive.</p>
<p>The rulings involving peer to peer software over the past few years have directed p2p software companies from trying to build the best network for swapping your Madonna and <a href="http://www.shreddingradio.com/metallica.html" target="_blank">Metallica</a> mp3s, to ones that actively promote their &#8217;significant non-infringing uses&#8217;. It may cost the company a little in bandwidth (for the streaming of the example tracks) but the cost of this is less than lengthy court cases around <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/question.cgi?QuestionID=269" target="_blank">vicarious infringement</a>. The goodwill generated is also a nice bonus, being known as a p2p client that actively promotes small artists is good publicity.</p>
<p>For artists, FrostClick is a unique opportunity to reach out to an audience of millions of music fans. Sean was impressed with the results of the campaign, stating on his <a href="http://fournstar.blogspot.com/2008/12/breaking-into-peer-to-peer-realm.html" target="_blank">blog</a> “My downloads have spiked tremendously since FrostClick / FrostWire stepped in so I wanted to take time to thank everyone over there and let them know that I appreciate all the support! This is awesome!”</p>
<p>FrostClick&#8217;s Kademlia told TorrentFreak they want to promote people that could get signed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be constantly looking for more professional independent content creators to give our users more legal alternatives and great media for free.&#8221; FrostClick is currently promoting <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2008/12/04/superficial-superstar-by-audra-hardt/">Audra Hardt</a>, and they have several other artists lined up for their free promotion service.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we reported on the plight of RARBG, a large tracker forced to close by anti-piracy outfit, BREIN. Now it appears that this is just the tip of the iceberg. A whole raft of trackers are being forced to close or relocate following police action, including ArenaBG and several other large sites.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/bulgaria.jpg" align="right" alt="bulgaria" />Yesterday we <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/brein-chases-another-bittorrent-tracker-to-sweden-081208/">reported</a> the story of RARBG, a 100,000 user tracker currently feeling pressure from anti-piracy group, BREIN. Although popular with Bulgarians, RARBG had an english version of the site and also indexed regular material that could be found on most trackers.</p>
<p>Rather than limited action against one site, the picture emerging today shows a concerted attempt by the police to take down many other Bulgarian trackers, both those hosted in their home country and others hosted elsewhere. A special police unit usually dedicated to fighting organized crime recently starting working to identify the administrators of the sites. Once identified, the police set about making contact with them, and each was invited to a meeting.</p>
<p>At the meeting the administrators were ordered to shut down the sites. There were no explanations as to why they should, or which laws were being put into effect, but the order was clear - shut down the sites or the police will come and take the servers. Below is a rundown of sites that are currently affected, but we can&#8217;t confirm yet that all of these administrators were actually at the meetings.</p>
<p>ArenaBG, at one stage thought to be one of the larger European trackers, currently displays the message, &#8220;Dear user, We were forced to close our website.&#8221; The site was hosted at LeaseWeb in The Netherlands. However, the site has an alternative URL at <a href="http://0.arenabg.com/">0.arenabg.com</a> and appears to be setting up a new open tracker, which can be found at <a href="http://free.arenabg.com/">free.arenabg.com</a>.</p>
<p>With 120,000 users, <a href="http://www.p2pbg.com">P2PBG</a> is a pretty significant site. Although still visible, the site has been ordered by the police to cease tracking torrents. P2PBG is hosted in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://masterstb.com/">MastersTB</a> tracker has disappeared. <a href="http://www.avatarbg.org/">AvatarBG</a>, another Bulgarian tracker is currently down, but links on the homepage show a forum and <a href="http://avatar-bg.org/">alternative</a> domain available elsewhere.</p>
<p>A site which intends to close altogether is <a href="http://www.torrent-bg.org/">Torrent-BG</a>. There is no longer a torrent section on the site and the site owner says he will even give away the domain to a worthwhile new owner.  Another site set to disappear is <a href="http://www.wordbg.com">WordBG</a>, and the administrators of <a href="www.zarta.org">Zarta.org</a> have announced that the site will no longer have a BitTorrent tracker, and that it will go in a new direction. All sites were hosted in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Currently, Bulgaria&#8217;s largest BitTorrent tracker <a href="http://www.zamunda.net/">Zamunda.net</a> is fully operational. It has around 500,000 members with a tracker serving up to a peak of 1.8 million peers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DNA sequencing is complex, and teaching students how it works can be quite a challenge. It often helps to use analogies, and give real life examples people are familiar with. At the University of Toronto they have found the perfect analogy to explain how DNA sequencing works: BitTorrent.</p>
<p>A growing number of Internet users know that BitTorrent is a great tool to download large files such as movies and music albums. While BitTorrent itself is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat#Overview">economic principles</a>, only a few know that it can also be used in biology class, since it&#8217;s a great analogy for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_sequencing">DNA sequencing</a>.</p>
<p>In a course on &#8216;Organisms in their Environment&#8217; taught by Prof John Stinchcombe at the University of Toronto, this resemblance is used to help students to understand this complex matter. One of Stinchcombe&#8217;s students told TorrentFreak that he was &#8220;pleasantly surprised&#8221; when he saw BitTorrent being linked to his course material, and shared the slides with us.</p>
<p>Similar to BitTorrent, the first step is to chop the material into small pieces (with enzymes). After that, all the pieces are put back together again with computer algorithms, thereby reconstructing the DNA. Similarly, with BitTorrent the pieces are also put back together again, reassembling the file that&#8217;s being shared. </p>
<p>The whole analogy is of course a little oversimplified, but it did at least grab the attention of some of the more tech savvy students. The slide at the bottom of the post is the one that Prof John Stinchcombe used to compare DNA sequencing to an &#8220;everyday life&#8221; example, with The Pirate Bay as one of its applications.</p>
<p>Is this news? Hardly. But, perhaps more than anything, it shows how mainstream BitTorrent has become recently.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RARBG, probably one of the biggest BitTorrent trackers you&#8217;ve never heard of, has been ordered to close by anti-piracy outfit, BREIN. The 100,000 member site, which is particularly popular with Bulgarians, doesn&#8217;t intend to comply but simply move to a different host, outside of BREIN&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Born just over 12 months ago, <a href="http://www.rarbg.com">RARBG</a> is a pretty big site to stay off most people&#8217;s radar. Tracking over 50,000 torrents and clocking up 1.1 million unique visits per month, the site (which has open signups) was previously hosted in Bulgaria but after attracting the attention of the police it more recently moved to the Netherlands-based host, <a href="http://www.leaseweb.com/en/">LeaseWeb</a>.</p>
<p>The move prompted the admins to work on an international version of the site which caused it to rapidly gain in popularity. It now has over 100,000 users, with its tracker reporting 185,000 seeds and 178,000 leechers. </p>

<p>Of course, with popularity comes more attention from anti-piracy outfits, the most famous one in the Netherlands being BREIN. Accordingly, BREIN has put pressure on LeaseWeb who in turn has advised its customer, RARBG, that it has 48 hours to shut down the site - or LeaseWeb will do it for them.</p>
<p>So what makes it so easy for BREIN to shut down the site? In 2007, LeaseWeb, once one of the largest BitTorrent hosts, was ordered by a court to shut down the relatively unknown BitTorrent tracker <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/torrent-sites-safe-haven-under-threat/">everlasting.nu</a>. Leaseweb actually appealed the court&#8217;s decision to shut down the site but lost, and was ordered to hand over the admin&#8217;s personal details. The overall result was an exodus of BitTorrent sites from LeaseWeb, including the likes of BTjunkie, Demonoid, What.cd and Waffles.fm. </p>
<p>TorrentFreak spoke with the admin of RARBG who told us he intends to move the site out of the Netherlands and into the current BitTorrent safe-haven of Sweden. Asked about plans for the future, he responded, &#8220;To keep the site up, whatever it takes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> RARBG has successfully moved to Sweden.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Resident Evil: Degeneration&#8217; is the first CG animation film inspired by the popular video game. Although it skips most US theaters and is scheduled to be released on DVD no sooner than late December, it has been downloaded on BitTorrent close to a million times already - in just four days.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/degeneration.jpg" align="right" alt="the dark knight" />&#8216;<a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/residentevildegeneration/">Resident Evil: Degeneration</a>&#8216;, or &#8216;Biohazard: Degeneration&#8217; as it&#8217;s known in Japan, will never become a blockbuster film, simply because it is only set for release in a few movie theaters. On the Internet, however, its popularity exceeds all expectations.</p>
<p>The film, produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, is set for a Sony Pictures DVD release in the USA on December 30. A few days ago it leaked onto the Internet and since then it has already been downloaded a million times via BitTorrent.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a movie quickly became popular online due to the release of a pirated copy. “The Man from Earth” is another example of a film that became <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/producer-thanks-pirates-for-stealing-his-film-071113/">immensely popular</a> due to its distribution on BitTorrent. Contrary to the opinion of the big studios, many independent filmmakers see piracy as <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-a-boon-to-independent-filmmakers-071215/">free promotion</a> instead of a threat.</p>
<p>We doubt that Sony Pictures will respond similarly to the leak of &#8216;Resident Evil: Degeneration&#8217;, which tops our weekly download chart. Below is the full list of this week&#8217;s most downloaded movies on BitTorrent. The Dark Knight, which led the chart three weeks in a row, has dropped to third place. Later this week and following on from our <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-pirated-games-of-2008-081204/">top 10 most downloaded games</a> chart, we will publish the top 10 most downloaded movies in 2008.</p>
<p>The data for our weekly download chart is collected by <a href="http://www.TorrentFreak.com/">TorrentFreak</a>, and is for informational and educational reference only. Currently both DVDrips, DVD Screeners and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R5_(bootleg)">R5 rips</a> are counted.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to the world&#8217;s largest adult BitTorrent tracker were met with a surprise this morning. According to Google and Firefox, users accessing Empornium.us are exposed to four trojan horses and three exploits. The malware doesn&#8217;t appear to be hosted by the site itself, but it is coming from outside sources.</p>
<p>Empornium.us is probably the world&#8217;s largest adult-material tracker. Indeed, at one stage it had over a million members which could elevate it to the position of world&#8217;s biggest private tracker, for any material. The site found itself in controversy in 2006 when an Israeli advertising company <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/targetpoint-takes-over-empornium/">took over</a> the site and kicked out many of the admins. For its part, Targetpoint denied the allegations, claiming one of its associates simply brokered the sale to an unknown third-party.</p>
<p>Today, users searching Google for Empornium.us are met with a warning under the URL: &#8220;This site may harm your computer&#8221;. After ignoring the warning and clicking the link using Internet Explorer, the Empornium main page starts loading, but is then punctuated with virus/malware/exploit warnings from an up-to-date anti-virus scanner. Google reports &#8220;Malicious software includes 4 trojans, 3 exploits. Successful infection resulted in an average of 11 new processes on the target machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>During our tests we caught malware or exploits which seemed to originate from: </p>
<blockquote><p>hxxp://hardmoviesporno.com/test/exp/update1.pdf<br />
hxxp://ffseik.com/25/2/getfile.php?f=vispdf </p></blockquote>
<p>At this point we deemed the Google Safe Browsing <a href="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.empornium.us/&#038;hl=en">report </a>to be correct and abandoned our own tests. Accessing the Empornium homepage using Firefox3 caused an immediate halt:</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/epornblocked.jpg" alt="EmporniumBlocked" /></p>
<p>Google notes that the &#8216;malicious software&#8217; is actually hosted on 4 domains, including gianttopnano.cn, mmcounter.com, filmmultimediaonline.cn. Furthermore it states that two domains appear to be &#8220;functioning as intermediaries for distributing malware to visitors of this site&#8221; including vxhost.cn, and filmmultimediaonline.cn.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak has contacted Empornium management for a comment, but so far there has been no response.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Empornium Team contacted us, confirming that the malicious code has nothing to do with them and they are &#8220;taking action to shut down the infiltration &#038; remove the code asap&#8221;. Their own tests so far show it is &#8220;exploiting a known &#038; patched security hole in Acrobat&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February 2007, BitTorrent Inc. launched its &#8216;Torrent Entertainment Network&#8217; where users could download movies and TV-shows legally, via BitTorrent. Despite the ever increasing popularity of BitTorrent as a download tool, the store never became profitable and has now closed. The store is replaced by a BitTorrent search portal.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/btlogo.jpg" align="right" alt="bittorrent" />While spending on online video content is increasing, BitTorrent Inc&#8217;s <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrentcom-launches-video-store/">Torrent Entertainment Network</a> wasn&#8217;t as successful as the company had hoped. Converting the millions of BitTorrent users into paying customers didn&#8217;t go as easily as they had hoped, and the DRM restrictions that were enforced by Hollywood <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/drm-killing-bittorrentcom-video-store/">were no help</a> either.</p>
<p>In the tough economic climate, which already caused <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/11/07/bittorrent-makes-additional-cuts/">several layoffs</a> at the company, BitTorrent Inc. decided that it was best to close their video store completely. Simon Morris, BitTorrent’s VP of Product Management told TorrentFreak: &#8220;After a great deal of soul searching we decided to close down the Torrent Entertainment Network content store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Its about focus and economics,&#8221; Morris added. &#8220;We want to focus on core technology rather than merchandising and given the harsh economic environment, we can’t afford to continue to invest in endeavors that don’t come close to break-even.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together with the closure of their entertainment network, the company reintroduced <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/btusers">its search portal</a> for BitTorrent users. Unlike before, there are no torrents indexed or tracked by the companies servers. Instead, it uses a branded version of the <a href="http://ask.com">Ask.com</a> search engine, where BitTorrent sites are prioritized in the search results. </p>
<p>When BitTorrent Inc. had its own search engine, the company had an agreement with the MPAA to filter search results. According to Morris this is no longer needed now. &#8220;We agreed to filter search results when we were in the business of torrent search, but that work is also discontinued. This is Ask’s search engine, not ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to work with Ask is simply an effort to provide people who come to download the client with a place to go next,&#8221; Morris added. While the search engine will generate some income, most future revenue is expected to come from content publishers that use BitTorrent&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/dna/?csrc=splash">DNA</a>, and deals with <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/devices/?csrc=splash">device manufacturers</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anti-piracy organizations are known for their excellent lobbying skills. However, knowledge of the Internet and technology doesn&#8217;t seem to be a prerequisite. Recently the Lithuanian anti-piracy outfit changed its name, but forgot to register the new domain. It now belongs to the owner of one of the largest BitTorrent sites in the country.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/lanva.gif" align="right" alt="lanva" />There are a lot of BitTorrent users in Lithuania, and the two largest BitTorrent sites in the country, <a href="http://torrent.lt">Torrent.lt</a> and <a href="http://linkomanija.net">Linkomanija.net</a> are in the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=LT&#038;ts_mode=country&#038;lang=none">top 20</a> of Lithuania&#8217;s most visited websites.</p>
<p>Of course, a country with plenty of &#8216;pirates&#8217; has to have its own anti-piracy organization, and Lithuania is no different. The local anti-piracy outfit goes by the name <a href="http://www.anva.lt/index_en.html">ANVA</a>, an acronym for &#8216;Antipiracines Veiklos Asociacija&#8217;. Their main targets are the local BitTorrent sites, which they have announced they will sue for millions in damages.</p>
<p>To use the word &#8216;Lithuania&#8217; in a Lithuanian organization&#8217;s name requires government approval. Recently, ANVA changed its name to LANVA, after they succeeded in getting this authorization. This seal of approval may give the organization more credibility, but there is a small problem. They forgot to register the domain lanva.lt when they changed their name. Before, they were using anva.lt, but while they did make a new logo with the L included, registering a new domain didn&#8217;t come to mind.</p>
<p>Usually, mistakes like this can be easily overcome by paying a certain amount of money to the person who was smart enough to register the domain, but not this time. Kestas Ermanas, the owner of one of the largest BitTorrent sites in Lithuania, <a href="http://www.lrytas.lt/-12284871201227537241-p1-it-milijoniniais-ie%C5%A1kiniais-grasinusiai-asociacijai-interneto-piratai-smoge-atgal.htm">registered</a> the domain as soon as he found out about the name change, and he is not planning to hand it over to his arch rival.</p>
<p>The domain Kestas bought currently displays the <a href="http://lanva.lt/">following message</a>: &#8220;This is how it works. Whatever you sink, we build back up. Whomever you sue, ten new pirates are recruited. Wherever you go, we are already ahead of you. You are the past and the forgotten, we are the Internet and the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>LANVA has scheduled an emergency meeting next Thursday to discuss what they can do to get the lanva.lt domain in their possession. The chances that they will get the domain through a dispute are very slim though. There have been several cases in Lithuania where large companies sued owners of domain names, and they lost every single time.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that an anti-piracy organization has had a domain dispute with a BitTorrent site. October last year The Pirate Bay <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ifpi-now-owned-by-the-piratebay-071012/">got hold</a> of the domain name of IFPI, under which they wanted to launch the &#8220;International Federation of Pirate Interests.&#8221; The case was later lost by The Pirate Bay, but the fact that they acquired it in the first place is yet another example of the tech illiteracy of these organizations.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers in the UK are obtaining the personal details of over 25,000 alleged file-sharers for the purposes of sending them a £500+ bill accompanied by threats of being sued. Read why the government&#8217;s Information Commissioner has let down every single one of them and why each disclosure could be a serious breach of the Data Protection Act.</p>
<p>Following numerous TorrentFreak investigations, today the BBC has published numerous articles, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/technology/newsid_7765000/7765386.stm">online</a> and on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00fq8cd/5_live_Breakfast_05_12_2008/">radio</a> about companies and lawyers who track down alleged file-sharers in the UK.</p>
<p>If you have received a letter from lawyers Davenport Lyons (or indeed any other law-firm operating the same business model) accusing you of illegally sharing games, videos or music, this article will provide serious food for thought and give you the tools and knowledge to make your voice heard at a government level. It is unacceptable that people are being wrongfully accused. We believe that your names and addresses should not have been handed over to these lawyers in the first place, and that you should not have received a threatening letter. </p>
<p>This is a guest post from Michael Coyle of Lawdit Solicitors who is currently defending many of those accused in the Dream Pinball, Colin McRae Dirt, Call of Juarez and more recently, the various porn titles cases brought by DigiProtect in the UK. <em>(Intros, links, editing and letter template added by TorrentFreak/Penumbra)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alleged File-Sharers: Why the Information Commissioner Has Let You Down</strong></p>
<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (<a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/about_us.aspx">ICO</a>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-departmental_public_body">non-departmental</a> public body reporting directly to Parliament. It is the office dealing with the Data Protection <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/Acts1998/ukpga_19980029_en_1">Act 1998</a> and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 in England and Wales.</p>
<p>UK ISPs were ordered earlier this year [and in 2007] by the High Court to disclose information relating to its customer&#8217;s data, based on information provided to them by amongst others, video games companies. The information sought was based on the customer&#8217;s IP address. Pursuant to <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part31.htm#IDAYNB1B">CPR 31.18</a>, lawyers applied for an order that the ISPs disclose the full name, postal address and telephone number of the subscriber of each of the IP addresses supplied.</p>
<p>The game plan was to match each IP address with an individual and write to them with a hefty threatening letter and a request for £500-600. If this sum was not paid, court action was threatened, costing tens of thousands of pounds. It all seemed fairly conclusive. The ISPs complied and the Lawyers [Davenport Lyons] commenced the enormous task of writing to over (so we understand) 25,000 potential infringers.</p>
<p>However it was only when responses started to flood in - many in their hundreds to Lawdit Solicitors - did it become clear that while IP addresses could reveal a name and real-life address, it did not reveal the culprit. It proved very little. It certainly did not prove that any copyright infringement had taken place, far from it. Only by inspecting the hard drive of the customer&#8217;s computer could you do this. If there were any other evidence to sit alongside the IP address, for example a user name or password of the file sharing software you could sympathize with the rights holder.</p>
<p>But to rely on the IP address alone is wholly disproportionate and has resulted in untold misery to many thousands of individuals. This whole affair sums up in my view how little the Information Commissioner (IC) is really concerned with an individual&#8217;s data. I am not aware of any publicly quoted concerns from the IC about this issue and he has remained silent as the forums and bulletin boards crackle with the indignation and invasion of individual&#8217;s data. You cannot blame the ISPs. As a Court Order was in place, why would an ISP go out on a limb for a few thousand customers?</p>
<p>But the IC ought to have been keeping a watchful eye out and at the very least issue a press release to offer individuals some comfort. The silence is even more deafening in that on 29 January 2008, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/european-filesharers-anonymous-080129/">the ECJ held</a> that Community law does not require member states to oblige ISPs to disclose details of suspected file-sharers to enable a copyright owner to bring civil proceedings.</p>
<p>Personal data is protected generally in the EU by virtue of the EC Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (95/46/EC) (Data Protection Directive). Member states may provide exemptions to protection in order to conduct criminal investigations or safeguard national or public security or to protect the rights and freedom of others (Article 13(1), Data Protection Directive).</p>
<p>In the UK such an exception can be found under section 35 (1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 which provides that &#8216;Personal data are exempt from the non-disclosure provisions where the disclosure is required by or under any enactment, by any rule of law or by the order of a court.&#8217; This exemption does not contain any further considerations for a Data Controller before making a disclosure in these circumstances.</p>
<p>The EC Directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (2002/58/EC) (E-Privacy Directive) provides that national authorities may only lift the protection of data privacy in order to safeguard national or public security or to conduct investigations into <em><strong>criminal</strong></em> offences or the unauthorised use of an electronic communications system, where this is a &#8220;necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure&#8221; (Article 15(1), E-Privacy Directive).</p>
<p>The ECJ reached its conclusion<em><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080005en.pdf">(.pdf)</a></em> following a Spanish case concerning Telefonica. The Juzgado de lo Mercantil No 5 de Madrid decided to stay the proceedings and referred the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:</p>
<p><em>Does Community law, specifically Articles 15(2) and 18 of Directive [2000/31], Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive [2001/29], Article 8 of Directive [2004/48] and Articles 17(2) and 47 of the Charter permit Member States to limit to the context of a criminal investigation or to safeguard public security and national defence, thus excluding civil proceedings, the duty of operators of electronic communications networks and services, providers of access to telecommunications networks and providers of data storage services to retain and make available connection and traffic data generated by the communications established during the supply of an information society service?</em></p>
<p>The ECJ, responded that the answer must be that Directives 2000/31, 2001/29, 2004/48 and 2002/58 do not oblige Member States to ensure effective protection of copyright in the context of civil proceedings to communicate personal data. A fair balance needs to be struck between the various fundamental rights and in particular the principle of proportionality. In Advocate General Kokott&#8217;s opinion she considered that it was compatible with Community law for member states to exclude operators of electronic communications networks and services from having to make available personal data relating to connection and traffic information in the context of a civil, as distinct from criminal, action. </p>
<p>While the decision is not binding on the ECJ it will generally follow the Advocate General&#8217;s opinion. For the vast majority if not all of the 25,000 recipients, this decision ought to have been interpreted as a request for information relating to a non criminal offence (i.e. any copying/file-sharing was non-commercial) and the request for the personal data ought to have been refused.</p>
<p>If you have received a letter accusing you of illicit file-sharing and you are innocent then please write to the Information Commissioner with your story and complain that the release of your personal data was a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998, while urging them to carry out a review of all subsequent releases.</p>
<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just over a day since the MovieX BitTorrent tracker disappeared following the arrest of two admins, the 400,000 member site has returned. A remaining admin is adamant that TorrentFreak completely fabricated the story and that the brothers who ran the site weren&#8217;t arrested. All the indications point to the opposite being true.</p>
<p>According to the Australian Federal Police, two Brisbane men from the same family, a 21 year-old and a 27 year-old, were arrested two days ago. The site they founded and administered was MovieX.info, although one of the remaining administrators Dev0 claims that <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/moviex-bittorrent-tracker-busted-by-australian-police-081204">TorrentFreak</a> and many other <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&#038;tab=wn&#038;ned=us&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;ncl=1277325845">news outlets</a> completely fabricated the story, claiming a simple hard drive failure.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/moviexlogo1.jpg" alt="moviex" /></p>
<p>Of course, TorrentFreak previously sent emails to the founders giving them ample opportunity to deny the allegations, but we have had absolutely no response.</p>
<p>Yesterday it became apparent that despite the site going offline, the domain name of MovieX.info wasn&#8217;t controlled by either of the arrested pair, making a return of the site likely. Indeed, although the arrests of the brothers caused a knee-jerk takedown of the site, in the AFACT (Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft) press release they took care not to mention the name of the site, probably mindful of the likelihood it would reappear. Today, that&#8217;s exactly what has happened.</p>
<p>Just a couple of hours ago the MovieX holding page disappeared to be replaced with an apparently-<a href="http://www.moviex.info">intact site</a>. Over time, the site got more and more busy and now there are many people back on the site, although some users are reporting that although the forum is functional, the tracker isn&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s early days. No doubt it will be fully functional soon.</p>
<p>Despite users on the site asking for one, there is currently no official message explaining the reasons for the downtime, but ®ama&#8217;s user account profile has been edited to remove statistics related to the material he personally contributed to the site. His location, Brisbane, and his actual date of birth remain, as does his original profile in Google&#8217;s cache. Indeed, none of this information is a secret, anyone can access it. He is the 27 year-old mentioned by the police.</p>
<p>When questioned about ®ama and his whereabouts and the lack of information by a VIP user, one admin said: &#8220;What I am saying is that whoever the person or persons are who have been arrested, [it's] none of my business.&#8221;</p>
<p>MovieX offered a VIP area where users could download material directly rather than use the site&#8217;s tracker. Much was made by AFACT of this section, claiming that the site generated revenue by charging users to access it. Since the site returned, some users are reporting that the section is inaccessible, although it is unclear if this is the case for all everyone.</p>
<p>Whereas with the OiNK raid, police took the time to completely neutralize the site by arresting the admin, seizing the domain name and confiscating the servers, Australian police did a much less comprehensive job. As a result, MovieX is back online with more publicity than ever before.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the news outlets that reported its demise will be just as quick to report that it&#8217;s back in business, but back it is, and despite uncertainty in other areas (such is the &#8216;fog&#8217; of BitTorrent) there can be no doubt about that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> (03:09 PM)  dev0 [admin] &#8220;Tracker is now back online&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2008 is slowly moving toward its end, we start taking a look at the most pirated titles in various categories. First up are games. As expected, Spore is by far the most downloaded game on BitTorrent, in part thanks to the DRM that came with the game.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/spore.jpg" align="right" alt="spore pirated bittorrent" />Traditionally, games can&#8217;t compete with the most pirated movies and TV-shows in actual download numbers, but Spore came very close this year.</p>
<p>Only 10 days after the game&#8217;s launch date, already <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/spore-most-pirated-game-ever-thanks-to-drm-080913/">half a million</a> people had downloaded the game. During the months after that, another million people obtained a copy of the game via BitTorrent. According to our estimates, Spore was downloaded 1.7 million times since early September, a record breaking figure for a game.</p>
<p>When we posted about the impressive download rate on Spore - inflated due to the DRM that was put into the game - EA doubted our statistics. EA’s Mariam Sughayer <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ea-downplays-spores-drm-081001/">said</a> that every BitTorrent download was not a successful copy, and that several downloads didn&#8217;t work, were buggy, or contained viruses. We wont deny that on badly moderated torrent sites, malicious torrents probably can be found. However, this constitutes less than 1% of the available torrents, and they are not added to our statistics.  </p>
<p>Below is the list of the 10 most downloaded (PC) games on BitTorrent in 2008, with an estimated download count for each. In second place we see The Sims 2, also from the hands of Spore creator Will Wright. Assassins Creed completes the top 3 with just over a million downloads.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MovieX, a very large BitTorrent site which made the headlines last year for its controversial tracker policy, has been shut down by Australian police. The site, thought to have as many as 400,000 users, is being blamed for the &#8216;transfer&#8217; of 14 million movies and TV shows. So far, two people have been arrested.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/moviex.jpg" align="right" alt="Moviex Leeches From The BitTorrent Community" />Last year, semi-private BitTorrent site MovieX <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/moviex-leeches-from-bittorrent-community-071201">hit the headlines</a> after it was accused of diverting upload bandwidth from users of The Pirate Bay, to its own tracker. Non-members of MovieX were allowed to upload to MovieX members but were not allowed to download from them. This move wasn&#8217;t appreciated by a large proportion of the BitTorrent community.</p>
<p>Today, the site has bigger things to worry about. A press release from AFACT, (Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft) has proclaimed the death of a huge site, but stopped short of naming it. </p>
<p>TorrentFreak can now exclusively reveal that the site in question was MovieX, with one of the founders being Rama from Brisbane. The domain currently displays this message and is still operational:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are temporarily offline.</p>
<p>Currently there is NO ETA AVAILABLE</p>
<p>@ADMINISTRATORS: PLEASE CONTACT DEV0 ASAP! ASK AROUND OTHER ADMINS IF YOU DON&#8217;T KNOW HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Australian Federal Police who shut down the site following an AFACT  investigation, two Brisbane men from the same family - a 21 year-old and a 27 year-old (thought to be brothers) were arrested yesterday. </p>
<p>A bank account containing around AUS$54,000 (US $35,000) was frozen after the police alleged the money was proceeds from the site. Investigators close to the inquiry claim the site generated around AUS$10,000 (US $6,450) each month, with many users donating $10 a month for VIP access to direct-download material, which was separate from the site&#8217;s BitTorrent tracker. Other bank accounts connected to the site are currently under investigation. Computer equipment was also seized with a storage capacity of 2 terabytes.</p>
<p>&#8220;BitTorrent is a legitimate and efficient software for sharing files but, like any tool, it can be misused,&#8221; <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/police-bust-major-film-and-tv-piracy-operation/2008/12/04/1228257209775.html">noted</a> Neil Gane, AFACT&#8217;s Director of Operations.</p>
<p>Andrew Traucki who directed the Aussie movie Black Water has been getting in on the action, &#8220;applauding&#8221; the closure of the site. &#8220;Being a low budget film I didn&#8217;t get paid much and hoped to make some money for all my effort from the films&#8217; sales. The fact that Black Water had been pirated and was online within days of being finished is upsetting. How are Australian film producers like me meant to make a living from our films if people pirate the film and watch it for free?&#8221;</p>
<p>However, although the movie was available for download via MovieX, things probably aren&#8217;t as bad as Traucki is now making out. As recently as August this year, Traucki said that he was delighted with the success of the movie, telling <a href="http://www.dvdindustry.com.au/Rental_News.php?goto=1461">DVDindustry</a>, “We wanted to make a film with international appeal and obviously we’ve succeeded,&#8221; going on to note that the movie had enjoyed &#8220;a remarkable sales ride&#8221;.</p>
<p>Penalties for commercial copyright crimes in Australia can amount to $60,000 and 5 years in jail for each offense.</p>
<p>More on this story as we get it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> MovieX has opened a temporary forum. It is claimed there that the arrests have nothing to do with MovieX, but we have sufficient information showing that the opposite is true.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Touted as the biggest ever anti-piracy collaboration, the MPA and several major anti-piracy groups have announced that by the time the 2012 Olympics begin, they will have made London &#8220;a fake-free zone&#8221;. This impossible mission to stamp out DVD piracy was launched by Intellectual Property Minister, David Lammy.</p>
<p>The Motion Picture Association, U.K. Film Council, UK Intellectual Property Office, Federation Against Copyright Theft, London Councils, Trading Standards and the Police are teaming up to eliminate DVD piracy in London before the 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Minister David Lammy endorsed the launch of the ambitious &#8216;Fake Free London&#8217; project, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jdCItifOaM2ULOCq2tpYlEHQ0ivQ">noting</a> that the police will be required to enforce already-existing laws: &#8220;Legislation alone will not combat counterfeiting and piracy. Good law is great but enforced law is better.&#8221; He said the aim of the campaign was send a message that people are serious about tackling the problem, and that consumers and legitimate businesses would be better off as a result.</p>
<p>Apparently there have already been dozens of arrests, but it is unclear if these were connected to running an operation manufacturing the counterfeit DVDs, or selling them. In the UK right now, the difference in terms of how the courts deal with the people at the top compared to the bottom is marked.</p>
<p>Street sellers, often from other countries, are at the bottom of the food chain and are usually cautioned by the police, DVDs confiscated and sent on their way. Some receive small fines but more usually, those that continually flout the warnings could find themselves the subject of an Anti-Social Behavior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Social_Behaviour_Order">Order</a>. If they breach the terms of those, it&#8217;s possible they&#8217;ll go to prison, but few do. It&#8217;s hard to see that this process is much of a deterrent, it relies on an offender getting caught lots of times. Besides, the UK has very little prison space right now.</p>
<p>Towards the top end of the food chain, things are different. Last month, another UK man Steven Adams, a fairly large-scale counterfeiter who also fitted huge numbers of XBox and Playstation modchips, received a fairly hefty sentence from the courts. He pleaded guilty to 44 charges, including the manufacture and selling around £1 million of counterfeit products. Adams had toured computer and flea markets all over the UK and at the time of his arrest, police found 31,000 counterfeit discs in his possession. He had numerous expensive properties, vehicles and possessions but didn&#8217;t try to hide his wealth, something which he will now regret as the court takes action to seize them. For his sins, Adams also received 3 years in jail.</p>
<p>The punishment for commercial piracy in the UK starts with a simple caution and goes up 10 years in jail and an unlimited fine, so it seems the tools to deal with the problem are already there, but is there the will to start locking more people up? Time will tell, but it seems unlikely. So can the MPA win its very own Olympic event? A bronze medal, absolute maximum.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon, the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, is under attack by online pirates. An add-on for the Firefox browser called &#8216;Pirates of the Amazon&#8217; makes it possible to shop at the Amazon store but leave without paying a dime. Instead, on Amazon product pages the add-on integrates links to &#8216;free&#8217; copies on The Pirate Bay.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/amazon-pirate-logo.jpg" align="right" alt="pirates of the amazon" />The timing of the &#8216;<a href="http://pirates-of-the-amazon.com/">Pirates of the Amazon</a>&#8216; launch could not have been more (un)fortunate. At the busiest time of the year for on- and offline retailers, this Firefox browser add-on offers users a download link to pirated copies of products that can normally be found in the Amazon online store.</p>
<p>When the add-on is installed, it integrates a new “download 4 free” button into the Amazon product page when the same article is also available via The Pirate Bay. It works for CDs, DVDs, games, books and basically all products that can be converted to a digital format.</p>
<p>With their mashup of the largest online retailer and the largest BitTorrent tracker, the project aims to &#8220;be a counterpart to the current models of media distribution&#8221;, and to &#8220;redistribute the wealth&#8221;.</p>
<p>The people behind the project have chosen to link to The Pirate Bay, but clearly state that they act independently. &#8220;We are not affiliated with The Pirate Bay, and do not host or even link to any illegal content,&#8221; they write. &#8220;This artistic project addresses the topic of current media distribution models vs. current culture and technical possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Pirates of the Amazon&#8217; is not the only pirate add-on for Firefox, in fact there are quite a few. IMDB, Last.fm, and Rotten Tomatoes all have their own pirate skin available. Most of them use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> add-on which allows the installation of all kinds of useful user scripts which customize the web to your <a href="http://userscripts.org/tags/torrent">pirate needs</a>. </p>
<div class="alert"><strong>Update:</strong> The site seems to be offline, here is a backup of <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/files/piratesoftheamazon.xpi">the xpi file</a> (piratesoftheamazon.xpi) for the add-on. In Firefox > file > open file > select the xpi file.</div>
