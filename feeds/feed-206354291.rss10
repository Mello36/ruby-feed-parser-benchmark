<![CDATA[ Recently, several well-known auto makers have considerably sacked their temporary workers because their sales took a nose-dive. Not only auto makers, but other home industries also face a tough situation which they can't help cutting the workers due to recession.<br /><br />This morning, I visited an English learner's house to have time for English. We read an article the leaner had picked from a news paper. The content was just related to the stirred industries world.<br />The government adopted its Work-life balance Chapter: WLB, last year. The Chapter aims at a society where people (1) can reach financial independence through employment; (2) have enough private time to lead healthy and affluent lives; and (3) choose from diverse working and living styles. However, the author claimed it focused on full-time workers rather than non-regular workers such as pert-timer or temporary workers. In fact, a famous machinery maker boasts of implementing "no-overtime days." But, who must finish left work after the full-time workers quit for the day? It's easy to think that the temporary workers or subcontractors are burden with the work.<br />The author also insisted that the Chapter is to equally considered. Then, and only then will it achieve work-life balance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, WLB is hot topic; nevertheless, it seems to be far behind in Japan. What's worse, the present state of industries seems to put it on the back burner...  ]]>

<title>For a change...</title>
<description> This morning, I attended an English club after I took my son to school. Usually, we learn English through an article picked from a newspaper or a magazine.

<![CDATA[ This morning, I attended an English club after I took my son to school. <br /><br />Usually, we learn English through an article picked from a newspaper or a magazine. However, this time, we introduced a movie. <br />At the beginning of the class, we each talked about the latest news. And then, we got down to an article which the representative had prepared. At the end of the class, we watched the movie to improve our listening skills.  Unluckily, There wasn't time enough to watch the whole story; nevertheless, we enjoyed watching and learning English.  When we couldn't catch a part of the lines clearly, we repeated the scene a few times until we could understand. <br /><br />( I said before, though.) Learning English through a movie is one of the most effective ways to improve our English skills. We can learn different pronunciation depending on actors, actresses or where they're from; slang; colloquial phrases and so forth.<br />I really want to try the same way next time if we can. :D<br /> ]]>

<![CDATA[ In the morning, I visited the school where my son goes because it was an open day. This time was a gymnastic lesson. Needless to say, I recorded him on a video tape. hehe (My husband and I are going to watch it drinking this night. :D)<br />During the lesson, I noticed that he was looking for his best friend. lol When the students were running and exercising, he wanted to stay next to the friend. (The friend and he always play at the school, so I understand the situation....haha)<br /><br />After the school, we visited a certain garage to repair a part of my car. The garage is run by my friend's husband. I'm not familiar with cars and their parts, so I can't explain about it in detail...Xl <br />Anyway, if the part is left unrepaired, it'll cause anything trouble with the engine, according to the repair man. As we're going to use the car more than usual from the end of year to the new year, we had asked the man to repair it. <br /><br /> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Today was our son's 4th birthday. We went out to buy birthday presents for him in the afternoon. A few days ago, a new huge sopping mall was opened, so we went there this time.<br />As we expected, a numbers of cars and people were heading to the mall in droves.<br />Fortunately, we could park near to the entrance. ;D  After hanging out, we went to the toy department. It goes without saying that our son was excited and his eyes were very bright. lol <br />Usually, we don't buy "regular toys" such as ranger's figuers or items of a certain ranger, which cost around 5,000 yen, because we know he'll get tired of playing with them sooner or later. Instead, we occasionally give him a "miniature toy", which costs around 300 yen and is available at any supermarkets. However, today is his special day, so we intended to present him what he wants, but "only one".  He chose a popular ranger robot. Actually, when I asked him what he wanted for his birthday present, he answered that he wanted the robot and he had been expressing his wish for several days.<br /><br />The night, we had a small birthday party for him. :D We sang "Happy Birthday" and recorded the party on a video tape. He seemed happy very much. ;D We, of course, were happy, too!<br /><br />We're looking forward to his growth from now. ]]>
