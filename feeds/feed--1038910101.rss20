		<description>&lt;p&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: This post is part of an ongoing series at Mashable - The Startup Review, Sponsored by Sun Microsystems Startup Essentials. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/startup-review-sponsored-sun-startup-essentials/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STARTUP DETAILS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company Name: &lt;a href="http://www.streamfile.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Streamfile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-word Description: Streamfile is an emerging startup with revolutionary technology in the file transfer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO&amp;#8217;s Pitch: Streamfile.com allows anyone to &amp;#8220;stream&amp;#8221; files that are too big to email without any additional need of installed software other than a browser. Streamfile is a hosted FTP replacement solution that allows streaming functionality. By streaming, we mean that when an uploader sends a file, downloaders are able to start the download process immediately. This single functionality enhancement actually allows time savings of up to 90% (compared to a traditional FTP server-to-client transfer). It&amp;#8217;s like P2P, but with a 24h answering service. All of the file transfers have the option to be encrypted with high-grade AES 256-bit SSL encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mashable&amp;#8217;s Take: Streamfile is intriguing not only for its ability to rather quickly broadcast files of up to 2GB in size to specified email addresses, but its simple construction as well. Everything is done via the browser within an elegant and sparse input menu. There is absolutely no need to operate proprietary software. Just browse for a file, provide one or more email addresses (you can also specify whom the package is from), and begin “streaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the backend, Streamfile operates as a replacement to your traditional FTP transfer service. As with some other modern transmission options of today, Streamfile allows for files to be downloaded almost immediately after an upload is begun. A similar option is offered by Pando, yet that service requires the use of proprietary software at either end of an established link to function properly. Streamfile can go without. And the fact that it is able to maintain 256-bit encryption if requested will please some privacy seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it explains within its site copy, Streamfile hosts data for a total of 24 hours. Which might irk some users, particularly if a situation isn’t time-sensitive and could ideally do with, say, a week’s worth of server/network access. The reason provided for this limit is quite logical for a startup of its type to cite: “By storing data for shorter time periods than our competitors&amp;#8230; we can maximize performance and bandwidth to guarantee superior door-to-door delivery speeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, Streamfile, based in Stockholm, Sweden, comes free of charge for users. (Period ends August 31.) Its stated profit model is business-to-business file transfers (integration with corporate websites is said to be possible). Such subscriptions run 49€/month or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored By: &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/startupessentials/join.jsp"&gt;Sun Startup Essentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/startupessentials/join.jsp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that everywhere I look, there’s someone telling us why &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/corporate-social-media/"&gt;corporate blogs&lt;/a&gt; are not only a waste of time if you’re looking for something to read, but they offer no value and should be taken down as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detractors claim corporate blogs lack transparency,  fail to adapt to the changing times,  and generally play the PR game without ever admitting issues or entering into a discussion with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s pure rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, most of these corporate blogs play the PR game and would rather tell you how wonderful they are than how awful they’ve performed over time, but who cares?  Do you really go to a corporate blog looking for the company to bash itself?  I seriously doubt the shareholders would be too happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, corporate blogs provide me with some insider knowledge into what’s really going on behind the scenes at some of these companies.  And while some make the complaint that transparency is an issue and corporate blogs keep things guarded, most corporate blog posts are actually quite transparent if you read between the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the company trying to hide something when it uses some clever language and side steps some major issues?  Is the company saying something different than it’s writing by including some innuendos?  These are the questions you need to ask when you read a corporate blog and generally, the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, not all corporate blogs are created equal.  &lt;a href="http://www.zillowblog.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt; has a great blog and &lt;a href="http://garmin.blogs.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin&lt;/a&gt; has done a fantastic job of adding some personality to an otherwise vanilla landscape.  &lt;a href="http://blog.twitter.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; has a nicely informative blog now that it’s trying to have a dialogue with its users and explain its issues and &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is easily one of the most entertaining companies in the corporate blogging space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blogs, much like countless others from companies across vastly different industries, may not offer something compelling with each post and sometimes they’re nothing more than an extension of the PR team, but even the most self-adulating blogs tend to offer some entertaining and extremely informative posts that not only act as the backbone for news stories, but for shareholder consumption as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who can forget Palm CEO Ed Colligan’s &lt;a href="http://blog.palm.com/palm/2007/08/thanks-engadget.html" target="_blank"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/21/dear-palm-its-time-for-an-intervention/" target="_blank"&gt;Engadget’s open letter&lt;/a&gt;?  Who else finds value in Garmin’s answers to reader questions?  How about Zillow’s celebrity listings that show you how much some of your favorite celebrities’ homes are worth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, it’s not that I love corporate blogs because they only talk about a company, but I love corporate blogs because they give a company some personality and they offer you some insight (no matter how guarded) into the people behind an organization that seems so cold and calculating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest we forget, tech companies are moneymaking machines.  Sure, some may not turn the kind of profit Microsoft does and others don’t seem to have their finger on the pulse of consumers like Apple, but each is managed by individuals with unique identities and something interesting to say – if we’ll listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t love corporate blogs because they spread propaganda – that’s a guarantee that you should be aware of before you head to the site – or because they tend to gloss over some of the less glowing facts.  I love corporate blogs because at the very least, they provide a human element to something that is devoid of emotion, understanding, and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I love corporate blogs because they’re the easiest way to file a complaint and tell more than a recording or a customer service agent that something is wrong.  In a matter of seconds, you can file a complaint in the comments and if people agree, they’ll jump on the bandwagon and in one fell swoop, your singular issue becomes a major problem and someone will be forced to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that most people look at corporate blogs as nothing more than another propaganda machine, but I don’t.  Sure, they’re inundated with useless crap from time to time, but I see them as more than a place for a company to write things about itself.  Corporate blogs give you clues about the organization’s culture, its people, and why (right or wrong) most of its employees believe in what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you ask me, there’s nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://socialbrowse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;socialbrowse&lt;/a&gt;, the Firefox plugin that lets you surf the Web in a link-sharing social manner, has just re-released its service with a couple of major new features.  The Y Combinator-backed startup as been in private beta for some time, and will remain in private beta for a little while longer, but those users testing the service will be able to access and utilize its new features (get your invite below).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new features revolve around the social sharing capabilities that socialbrowse has already laid out.  The first new feature supports in-page commenting, which allows you to leave comments on a link you&amp;#8217;re visiting without having to leave the page.  Submitting a comment, just as with a shared link, will broadcast your content across the Web in real time.  Comment icons will also appear on pages you visit so you and your friends will immediately be able to see the connection between your own activity and that of your friends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting visual tool accompanies the socialbrowse sidebar, offering a very direct and internally circular view of the Web as well as your own browsing behavior.  This of course can be turned into immediate recommendations as well as useful information regarding a particular site that may be more difficult or time-consuming to find otherwise via standalone bookmarking sites.  This capability also ties in closely with socialbrowse&amp;#8217;s second major new upgrade, the embedded icon expansion option.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-2.png'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Icons that display on pages as you surf the Web, indicating comments and shared links, can now be expanded when you hover over them, so you can get an at-a-glance view of the details behind each icon; who submitted the link, and what friends have contributed to the comments thread.  Similar to the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/08/jskit-acquires-haloscan/"&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt; now being employed by JS-Kit, the act of turning comments into a more visual and social component of Web surfing is a budding function that can be leveraged for all sorts of things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While socialbrowse uses these comments on a more internal basis and JS-Kit acts as a centralizing factor for comments you leave across the Web, they both result in a useful capacity for direct and indirect marketing and recommendations.  JS-Kit has already begun to  expound upon its features for the use of third-party sites like &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/18/evite-relaunch/"&gt;evite&lt;/a&gt;, and Socialbrowse being the existing community that it is can begin to leverage its capabilities in different ways, which will be interesting to observe as Socialbrowse continues beta testing and moves into a more public space.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;socialbrowse is offering Mashable readers 400 invites. &lt;a href="http://socialbrowse.com/mashable/" target="_blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to get yours.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Mashable is headed on its second leg of the Summer Tour, beginning with &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/us-summer-tour-2008/summermash-austin/"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/us-summer-tour-2008/summermash-miami/"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/us-summer-tour-2008/summermash-boston/"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, and ending at &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/us-summer-tour-2008/summermash-new-york-city/"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.  During each of these SummerMashes, attendees have a chance to score some sweet tickets to Austin&amp;#8217;s hottest interactive festival.  That&amp;#8217;s right, the nice folks behind South by Southwest are giving away two tickets per city to &lt;a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/" rel="nofollow"&gt;SXSWi 2009&lt;/a&gt;, which will be held from March 13-17 next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to sign up for the events now if you haven&amp;#8217;t, because prices will go up (and not down) for each individual SummerMash.  You could win tickets to one of the best tech events of the year!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;The 140 million dollars that &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/18/google-buys-russian-contextual-ad-service-begun/"&gt;Google dished out for Russian contextual ad company Begun&lt;/a&gt; now seems rather cheap, given their fantastic financial results for the first half of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As reported by Profy, &lt;a href="http://www.profy.com/2008/07/25/googles-begun-huge-profits/" target="_blank"&gt;Begun has had 25% higher profits&lt;/a&gt; in the first two quarters of 2008 than in the entire 2007. Add to that the 173.000 publishers (an increase of 30.000 over last year) in Begun&amp;#8217;s roster and it&amp;#8217;s obvious that this company is on track to completely corner the huge Russian contextual advertising market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Begun was ripe for acquisition; it probably needed funds to be able to sustain its quick growth, and on the other hand it showed huge potential. The question is, how do Microsoft, AOL and others always manage to miss chances like this one, while Google always seems to snag them at the exactly right time?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;According to the latest government data, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080725/ap_on_hi_te/china_internet_boom" target="_blank"&gt;China now has 253 million Internet users&lt;/a&gt;, due to recent sharp growth - 56 percent from last year. The inevitable has happened: China now has more Internet users than the USA, which is at 223.1 million with 71% online penetration. The fact that the Chinese government is exercising very strict control and censorship over internet use has immensely slowed down the growth of Internet use in this country, but when you&amp;#8217;ve got a population of over 1.3 billion, even a relatively small fraction of it is enough to become a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the really amazing thing is the fact that the online penetration is China is mere 19.1 percent, way, way lower than the USA and most European countries. Financial facts are even more revealing: total revenues for all of China&amp;#8217;s internet companies was $5.9 billion in 2007 while in the U.S. online advertising revenues alone in that same year were $21.2 billion. For companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and other giants, this means two words: untapped potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research firm BDA China Ltd. estimates that China&amp;#8217;s online population will keep growing by 18 percent annually - a modest estimation, considering that this growth was 56% this year - and reach 490 million by 2012. The US online market suddenly seems small in comparison. Due to strict Chinese government regulation of the Internet, financially the Chinese market will not catch up as fast as it could, but with a little (inevitable) westernization and a little globalization it&amp;#8217;ll get there, and every online firm will want a slice of the pie. This one growing market might be more important than most other world&amp;#8217;s markets put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there&amp;#8217;s a good portion of you that are going to instantly groan at the headline, either because it&amp;#8217;s a territory that&amp;#8217;s been hashed out a number of times from a number of different angles or because you&amp;#8217;re one of those folks who simply doesn&amp;#8217;t believe there are such thing as &amp;#8220;killer&amp;#8221; technology (I&amp;#8217;ve had that conversation with a few folks recently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1917/television-will-fall/" target="_blank"&gt;Duncan Riley put out an interesting&lt;/a&gt;, if not provocative, editorial this evening entitled &amp;#8220;Television will be the first traditional media medium to fall.&amp;#8221;  Personally, I have always felt that radio would be the first to falter, though in a neck-and-neck race with newsprint, but Duncan Riley puts some new stats to work in support the prediction today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The television switch off is real. In the United States, &lt;a href="http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2007/05/10/are-americans-switching-off-the-tv/"&gt;2.5 million viewers switched off&lt;/a&gt; in the spring on 2008 compared to the same time in 2006. Statistically this is only a small percentage of the overall viewing audience, but among those still watching television, the amount of television they watch each day &lt;a href="http://newteevee.com/2007/08/22/surprise-surprise-tv-viewing-is-declining/"&gt;is declining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in television viewing is stronger among younger statistical groups. In Europe, &lt;a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/digital/article/481205/young-people-switch-off-tv-radio-spend-time-online/"&gt;a 2005 study&lt;/a&gt; from the European Interactive Advertising Association found almost half of 15- to 24-year-olds are watching less TV in favor of browsing the web. A study reported in The Guardian &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/nov/12/internet"&gt;in 2007&lt;/a&gt; headlined with “Young networkers turn off TV and log on to the web.” The television switch off in the United States among younger people has seen the average age of a TV viewer &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/30/tv-viewers-average-age-hi_n_109898.html"&gt;increase to 50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats are compelling, and certainly point to an uncertain future for Old Media television, particularly in the face of the ever increasing volume of studies showing that pretty soon &lt;a href="http://willvideoforfood.com/2008/06/25/by-2013-youll-sleep-less-than-youll-watch-video/" target="_blank"&gt;we&amp;#8217;ll be watching video online more than we&amp;#8217;ll be sleeping&lt;/a&gt;. Duncan goes on to say that while newsprint and radio have some harrowing times ahead of them, they&amp;#8217;ll survive. At least, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure that I agree that TV is the first to go, though. Certainly Duncan makes a compelling case, and I&amp;#8217;m not one of those folks who thinks new technology incapable of killing old technology (you certainly don&amp;#8217;t see a lot of eight-tracks for sale these days, and photograph developing is quickly becoming a thing of the past). But we&amp;#8217;re seeing a lot more rapid detioration taking place in the music and radio business than we&amp;#8217;re seeing even in newspaper and television. It&amp;#8217;s an interesting deathrace between the industries, and it&amp;#8217;s difficult to call a &amp;#8216;winner&amp;#8217; to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/smashed-newspaper.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspaper death watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, newspaper decline is largely financial in nature.  Certainly, when you&amp;#8217;re talking about business, that&amp;#8217;s the most important factor to measure a media type&amp;#8217;s life span. Is that what we&amp;#8217;re really talking about here, though? The death of the media type or the changing of the guard in terms of the dominant companies behind them. In either event, newsprint and text delivery of news is increasingly being dominated by online blogs and news portals. Circulation may be technically up, but revenues for the companies that resist the transition to online delivery are &lt;a href="www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/29182"&gt;most decidedly down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise newspaper publications are managing some sort of a transition to an online revenue, but most companies that have their base in serialized news in the printed form still have problems adjusting to the new formats that we in the blogging business take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan is very positive that newspapers will always go the distance because of the need for quality journalism.  Unfortunately (at least for the newspaper industry) I don&amp;#8217;t see this as a particularly convincing argument.  Quality journalism can and does take place outside of newsprint, and for a much greater profit. Some traditional text journalism outfits may realize this and make the transition.  Most won&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I may be particularly negative towards newspaper futures due to the fact that in a previous life I consulted for several newspapers in their New Media efforts. In my experience they&amp;#8217;re generally not a very forward thinking bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV death and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, Duncan makes a compelling point for the impending doom of television, and I&amp;#8217;d go even further than he in my prognostications of doom for the media type. Again, like I said regarding the newspaper business, when you&amp;#8217;re talking about the death of a media, you&amp;#8217;re potentially talking about two things: either the media type itself or the industries behind that media production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation I think it&amp;#8217;s silly to say we&amp;#8217;ll stop watching video in our livingrooms on television sets.  Where the video that plays on those sets comes from is very likely to change very soon. Just yesterday I talked about a very clear path for Netflix and Roku to make a play for the livingroom very soon, but they&amp;#8217;re obviously not the only ones competing for eyeballs.  TiVo, Apple, and &lt;a href="http://www.seanpaune.com/2008/02/16/how-to-watch-internet-videos-on-your-tv/"&gt;a cadre of other set-top device manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; are working on taking real-estate in your entertainment center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional television has something that no set-top box solution has tackled or mastered yet (aside from coverage of live sporting events), and I&amp;#8217;ve talked about it in the past here in my editorials on the subject: the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/06/20/mainstream-online-video/"&gt;veg-factor&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the veg-factor, think about the type of media consumption you do in the morning, while you&amp;#8217;re getting the kids ready for school, or fixing breakfast in the morning while you&amp;#8217;re getting ready for work. Morning show format news-ish programs are designed for this low-engagement, veg-factor consumption. They&amp;#8217;re, in large part, designed to be background noise that delivers some entertainment and utility to your morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the evening, you come home from work, you switch on the TV and catch the local news or a Seinfeld re-run, and leave the TV on through Wheel of Fortune or whatever reality program du jour is on this season. Most people won&amp;#8217;t even touch the remote until prime-time starts. That&amp;#8217;s the veg-factor in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very simply, no one is doing this for the set-top box experience. Until there is a one-to-one equivalent for this, you won&amp;#8217;t see a complete replacement for television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/smashed-radio.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radio business has been even more dominated in recent years by mega-conglomorates and mergers. With this has come the &amp;#8216;Clearchannel approach,&amp;#8217; that has driven almost all radio towards a formula for profit. Anecdotally, this was hashed out recently in the comments of an editorial I recently wrote about the impending doom for radio at the hands of the iPhone&amp;#8217;s on demand music applications. Sean and I talked about this the other day, and the argument is compelling that radio is doing a decent job of killing itself, and requires no new technology to hasten its death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fact remains that new technologies like smartphones and other pocket devices coupled with the impending ubiquity of wireless Internet access makes things look pretty bleak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that, and I can almost hear Steven Hodson&amp;#8217;s voice cracking as he crankily reminds me that impending ubiquity of access is anything but certain (most likely because he reminds me once a week on &lt;a href="http://elitetechnews.com"&gt;Elite Tech News&lt;/a&gt;). He makes a compelling case for it, but recent news like the coming embedded &amp;#8220;Internet Chips&amp;#8221; from Intel &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/23/intel-launches-chips-that-will-bring-the-internet-to-everyday-things/" target="_blank"&gt;as VentureBeat reported on the other day&lt;/a&gt; makes me think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the thing that really makes radio&amp;#8217;s future look particularly bad compared to the rest - the record labels.  Talk radio is very ably making the transition to podcasting and other forms of online audio entertainment media types, but the record labels have very famously dug in their heels and made it next to impossible for broadcasters to adapt their business models for the online environment using popular music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, it isn&amp;#8217;t surprising to see radio clinging the hardest to their dying business models.&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2007/12/22/mashables-2008-predictions-marks-list/"&gt; I predicted back in December&lt;/a&gt; that we&amp;#8217;d see an end to at least one major record label this year, and I stick by that assessment. Given that the mainstream record labels are so integral to traditional radio&amp;#8217;s survival (and their demise is key to online radio&amp;#8217;s ascendence), I think it&amp;#8217;s now more than ever we should be looking to traditional radio as the first to die off.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, our resident cranky fart Steven Hodson &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/18/twitter-not-a-microblogging-tool/"&gt;posited that Twitter wasn&amp;#8217;t, in fact, a status micro-blogging utility&lt;/a&gt; but in fact a communictations tool most closely resembling instant messaging. Certainly when I&amp;#8217;m attempting to explain Twitter to newbies, that is the easiest way to explain it, but quite a few of you Mashable readers took exception to the characterization. As of the time of this writing, the debate still rages on with the comment count in the triple digit range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/18/twitter-not-a-microblogging-tool/"&gt;Steven&amp;#8217;s editorial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It amazes me how anyone in all seriousness can even consider the inane twaddle that permeates the Internet from services like Twitter as even coming close to blogging or micro-blogging. Has anyone really paid attention to what is being said on Twitter these days – that is if you can make it through the growing amount of spam that is occurring. Sure micro-blogging is a valid term when used to describe things like tumblr or posterous but not when used to describe Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mashable Conversations today, Sean and I try to make sense of the debate and put together what our take is on it.  Sean came into the discussion pretty squarely on Steven&amp;#8217;s side, but I was a bit unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m one of those guys that views the act of blogging, for almost all purposes, as a form of conversation (even if it is occasionally a conversation with yourself). Thus conversation being a form of communication, it isn&amp;#8217;t a leap to classify Twitter in the realm of conversational tool (though I&amp;#8217;ve always tended to view it more as a lifestreaming tool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on today&amp;#8217;s program is another exciting episode from the SummerMash tour, this from the San Francisco tour stop with a conversation with the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/01/filtrbox/"&gt;FiltrBox folks&lt;/a&gt; (who we had on Mashable Conversations recently ourselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check it all out by downloading the &lt;a href="http://ads.episodic.com/download/e31/f20/a-conversation-with-filtrbox.mp4" target="_blank"&gt;MP4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/mashableconversations-video"&gt;subscribing to our feed&lt;/a&gt;, or watching the embed below.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;When the CEO one of the most followed companies on the Web goes on stage for two hours, you can bet that the press will be listening to every word, looking to break a major piece of news for their respective organization.  But yesterday, with Mark Zuckerberg on stage at F8, why did we all (including us) feel so compelled to “live blog” the event, given it was being broadcast live on video – quite publicly - via Facebook’s own web site?  In retrospect, it seems rather ridiculous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While plenty of big news came out of the event – the launch of &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/facebook-connect-launches/"&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/facebook-translations-for-developers/"&gt;Facebook Translations for Developers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/live-f8-keynote-with-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;Great Apps program&lt;/a&gt;, just to name a few things – it seems like those who cared enough to get these announcements “live” were most likely either in attendance or watching the video stream.  Beyond that, if people wanted to discuss the announcements, Twitter or Friendfeed offered a perfect medium.  This is all besides the fact that the press release itemizing Facebook’s major product launches was distributed to the media moments after Zuckerberg took the stage, leading us (and a number of other tech blogs) to publish stories detailing the news before Facebook even got to that part of their presentation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liveblogging certainly has its place, especially for events where not everyone has access.  But what are we gaining by liveblogging something that everyone else can see?  And it’s not just keynote speeches at conferences either – blogs now routinely liveblog conference calls, press conferences, and other events that anyone can tune into, usually by going to a company’s investor relations or press page.   While news does often break during these events, the people who really care are already tuned in, while the few people reading the liveblog have to sort through paragraph upon paragraph of unimportant notes to find the one piece of potentially breaking news.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the overkill of liveblogging public events, I also don’t see what good it does from a business perspective as a publisher either.  Versus listening to an event or a conference call and making a post detailing the news when it’s over, a liveblog usually offers a boring headline (“&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/live-f8-keynote-with-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;Live: F8 Keynote with Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;”), is very difficult to read, and has minimal long-term value.  Compared to a post where you cover and analyze the news, write a headline that articulates what the story is about, and create long-term value in terms of content that is indexable and can be backlinked, liveblogging just doesn’t make sense.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of liveblogging such events would likely argue that it offers not only breaking news, but instant insight into the event from the perspective of someone in attendance.  While that is true to some extent, there is a ton more insight taking place elsewhere, via discussions on services like Twitter and Friendfeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we’ll continue to liveblog events here on Mashable, and I’m sure others will continue to do so as well.  I’m just not sure why.   &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks &lt;a href="http://www.plurk.com" target="_blank"&gt;Plurk&lt;/a&gt; has released a number of updates in preparation for its upcoming &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/06/10/plurk-api/"&gt;API launch&lt;/a&gt;. Improvements include, a new customizable sidebar widget, new starter verbs such as &amp;#8220;wonders&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;needs,&amp;#8221; a cleaner &amp;#8220;All Plurks,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;My Plurks&amp;#8221; navigation, along with a custom search feature. Plurk has even enhanced their competitive ranking system, also known as &amp;#8220;Karma&amp;#8221; to make the algorithm more fair and balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature that Plurk recently implemented that reminds me of the unofficial &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/06/30/twitter-enhanced-profile"&gt;Twitter extended backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; is the ability to customize everything on your profile via CSS if your Karma is over 25. Customizing your profile background is something that some Twitter users, myself included, have wanted to see, but after seeing a few backgrounds and profiles in Plurk, I&amp;#8217;m not so sure.  Take a look below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plurk fail whale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animated gator background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not saying they&amp;#8217;re bad - I&amp;#8217;ll let you be the judge of that. But customizing backgrounds should be an enhancement and not a distraction to users, especially since many Plurk users are waiting for desktop integration such as &lt;a href="http://blog.plurker.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Plurker&lt;/a&gt;, a Windows WPF desktop application or &lt;a href="http://www.twhirl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;twhirl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who Plurk on a regular basis I would say that we&amp;#8217;re satisfied with the service&amp;#8217;s development and features &amp;#8212; and just this week Plurk was added to the list of supported sites on FriendFeed. However, Plurk&amp;#8217;s community and conversations still remain a question. Currently from the twitter/tech/blog community, Darren Rowse of Problogger and Majo of Live Crunch are making headway up the interesting plurkers karma list. But still, without an API, no desktop application, and some of the most popular topics on Plurk being &amp;#8220;good morning,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;good night,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;hi,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;sex&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;coffee,&amp;#8221; it will be interesting to see what audience Plurk continues to build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Plurk the MySpace or Facebook of micro-blogging?  Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com" target="_blank"&gt;Opposing Views&lt;/a&gt; is a newly launched startup that lets experts go “on the record” and state their position on a controversial issue.  For example, the site asks “&lt;a href="http://opposingviews.com/questions/should-abstinence-only-sex-ed-be-taught-in-public-schools"&gt;Should abstinence-only sex-ed be taught in public schools?&lt;/a&gt;”  Lifeway Christian Resources and Teen Aid weigh in on the “Yes” side with a list of reasons that link to detailed information.  On the “No” side, the American Public Health Association and The National Campaign offer the alternative viewpoint, using the same set of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting new spin on an old concept.  Versus sites like Squidoo, Hub Pages, and the just launched &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/google-knol-launches/"&gt;Google Knol&lt;/a&gt; where experts attempt to write an authoritative article about a given subject and earn revenue, Opposing Views looks to have established organizations and experts state official positions that show both sides of an issue, without monetary compensation. Founder Russell Fine thinks that this approach creates unbiased information for the public, “especially when you have a problem,” he told me in an interview yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the best content rises to the top, the service has basic community features like ratings and reviews of articles.  Experts need to apply to Opposing Views, at which point the company verifies their identity.  So far, there are about 100 experts signed up, including official representatives from the McCain and Obama campaigns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make money, the 12-person company plans to sell sponsorships, syndicate content, and eventually license its platform to other media companies.  For example, Fine thinks there is a big opportunity in localized versions of Opposing View that provide opposing views of regional issues – like schools, the environment, and healthcare.  &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: This post is part of an ongoing series at Mashable - The Startup Review, Sponsored by Sun Microsystems Startup Essentials. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/startup-review-sponsored-sun-startup-essentials/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STARTUP DETAILS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company Name: &lt;a href="http://www.audiomicro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AudioMicro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-word Description: AudioMicro is the preeminent user generated micro stock music and sound effects licensing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO&amp;#8217;s Pitch: AudioMicro&amp;#8217;s proven business model, micro stock, makes its platform innovative and revolutionary in a music industry traditionally unwelcoming of new licensing and monetization models. Micro stock is a business model rooted in the photography industry whereby content is crowd sourced and democratically licensed for prices starting a $1. The largest micro stock photography licensor, iStockphoto.com, will experience approximately $122 million in FY 2008 revenues. AudioMicro is the iStockphoto of the audio world, operating in the $3.4 billion commercial music (performance and sync) licensing market, representing world class composers and sound designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mashable&amp;#8217;s Take: Launched earlier this year, AudioMicro, a Los Angeles-based stock music licensing service, is aiming to capture a part of the commercial music market at the same time that &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/05/14/istockphoto-royalty-free-musi/"&gt;iStockphoto has joined the fray&lt;/a&gt;. It may be right to assume that an earlier entry into the market would have bade better for its future. The field is now populated by the likes of independent operations such as YouLicense and even Getty Images, a global image-heavy juggernaut that acquired Pump Audio more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that major brands have involved themselves in the relatively young, Web-based audio licensing market, AudioMicro must rely almost exclusively on its content and cost structure in order to grab a healthy percentage of the market. Looking at its catalog of material, which the startup lists as user-generated, it seems to be working with a decent supply of material. As with most archives filled with music and sound effects and so forth, some content will interest few users, but there’s enough quality there to warrant an account. Fees are easy to understand, too. One minute or less will run you $1. The same ratio is had for anything up to 4 minutes in length. Push past that mark, and you’ll pay $5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the service’s layout, it’s simple enough that you more or less find your own way around without trouble. It would certainly do well to rearrange its front page to make it seem a bit more current. Perhaps more featured media and less tags would grab the eye of the visitor a bit more. But on the whole, it serves its purpose. If you don’t find what you’re looking for elsewhere, or if you would simply like a basic place to shop for stock downloads (or offer your own for sale), without having to contend with mountains of users pooling into higher-profile venues, AudioMicro is a good bet. The company&amp;#8217;s stated commissions for submitters of music and effects is 60% for exclusives (uploaded to AudioMicro only) and 50% for non-exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> <em>This post is part of an ongoing series at Mashable - The Startup Review, Sponsored by Sun Microsystems Startup Essentials. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details <a href="http://mashable.com/startup-review-sponsored-sun-startup-essentials/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>STARTUP DETAILS:</strong></p>
<p>Company Name: <a href="http://www.audiomicro.com/" target="_blank">AudioMicro</a></p>
<p><strong>20-word Description:</strong> AudioMicro is the preeminent user generated micro stock music and sound effects licensing platform.</p>
<p><strong>CEO&#8217;s Pitch</strong>: AudioMicro&#8217;s proven business model, micro stock, makes its platform innovative and revolutionary in a music industry traditionally unwelcoming of new licensing and monetization models. Micro stock is a business model rooted in the photography industry whereby content is crowd sourced and democratically licensed for prices starting a $1. The largest micro stock photography licensor, iStockphoto.com, will experience approximately $122 million in FY 2008 revenues. AudioMicro is the iStockphoto of the audio world, operating in the $3.4 billion commercial music (performance and sync) licensing market, representing world class composers and sound designers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30272" title="audiomicroscreen1" src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/audiomicroscreen1.png" alt="" width="450" height="208" /></p>
<p><strong>Mashable&#8217;s Take:</strong> Launched earlier this year, AudioMicro, a Los Angeles-based stock music licensing service, is aiming to capture a part of the commercial music market at the same time that <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/05/14/istockphoto-royalty-free-musi/">iStockphoto has joined the fray</a>. It may be right to assume that an earlier entry into the market would have bade better for its future. The field is now populated by the likes of independent operations such as YouLicense and even Getty Images, a global image-heavy juggernaut that acquired Pump Audio more than a year ago.</p>
<p><span id="more-30269"></span><br />
Now that major brands have involved themselves in the relatively young, Web-based audio licensing market, AudioMicro must rely almost exclusively on its content and cost structure in order to grab a healthy percentage of the market. Looking at its catalog of material, which the startup lists as user-generated, it seems to be working with a decent supply of material. As with most archives filled with music and sound effects and so forth, some content will interest few users, but there’s enough quality there to warrant an account. Fees are easy to understand, too. One minute or less will run you $1. The same ratio is had for anything up to 4 minutes in length. Push past that mark, and you’ll pay $5.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30273" title="audiomicroscreen" src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/audiomicroscreen.png" alt="" width="450" height="318" /></p>
<p>As for the service’s layout, it’s simple enough that you more or less find your own way around without trouble. It would certainly do well to rearrange its front page to make it seem a bit more current. Perhaps more featured media and less tags would grab the eye of the visitor a bit more. But on the whole, it serves its purpose. If you don’t find what you’re looking for elsewhere, or if you would simply like a basic place to shop for stock downloads (or offer your own for sale), without having to contend with mountains of users pooling into higher-profile venues, AudioMicro is a good bet. The company&#8217;s stated commissions for submitters of music and effects is <strong>60% for exclusives</strong> (uploaded to <strong>AudioMicro only</strong>) and 50% for non-exclusives.</p>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/20/studivz-facebook-lawsuit"&gt;Facebook filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against German social network studiVZ, claiming that the site copied its “look, feel, features, and services.”  Today, Multiply is alleging that Facebook did much of the same in launching its &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/20/new-facebook-launches"&gt;new re-design&lt;/a&gt;, and illustrating what they believe is a pattern of Facebook copying their site’s ideas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at how one’s profile looks on the new Facebook and how it looks on Multiply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no lawsuit has been filed by Multiply, the company is certainly coming out swinging.  In addition to the similarities in profile design, Multiply makes the following claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Multiply launched its proprietary newsfeed in August of 2004, when the site launched. Two years later, Facebook introduced a similar, yet more basic, news feed for its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Blogging, one of Multiply’s core features since launch, was introduced to Facebook more than 20 months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Video sharing, a Multiply feature since June 2005, was introduced on Facebook nearly 16 months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* In September 2004, Multiply introduced photo printing services for its users, something that Facebook implemented two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* In its most recent enhancement, “New Facebook” features several changes – both aesthetically and functionally – that make Facebook look and feel even more like Multiply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Multiply obviously feels like Facebook is copying them, they also take the opportunity to list reasons why they believe their product is superior, illustrated in the chart below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is Facebook ripping off Multiply, or is this simply a case of sour grapes?  While Multiply has been growing steadily (traffic &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/05/21/multiply-traffic-growth/"&gt;recently doubled&lt;/a&gt; to around 600 million monthly page views), it’s only a fraction of the size of Facebook. It’s also fairly common to see innovation imitated elsewhere on the Web – &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/06/13/myspace-redesign/"&gt;MySpace’s latest re-design&lt;/a&gt; added a lot of Facebook-like features including status updates and a news feed – so Multiply might not really have a foot to stand on, other than being able to say “we were first!”  Let us know what you think in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a guest post by Aseem Kishore, a technology enthusiast and lead blogger for &lt;a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Online-Tech-Tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of important data that we now store digitally on our desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and PDA’s is growing exponentially every year and accessing that data whenever we want from wherever we want is not an easy task. So whether you have GB’s of family pictures and music stored on your computer or lots of MS Office documents with critical business data, here’s a list of over 30 resources to sync your data between computers and mobile devices so you can have ubiquitous access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll find the list of file synchronization tools broken down into three main categories: open source, freeware, and commercial. Note that even though these file and folder synchronization tools store your data in more than one place, they would not be considered data backup solutions. File synchronization means that when you add, change, or delete a file from one location, the program will perform the same operation at the other location. Hence each copy of the data is the latest copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you using any of these file synchronization tools? If so, which one do you like the best?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source Software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/" target="_blank"&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt; – For those who know how to use the command line, rsync is a fast incremental file transfer utility. Requires manual configuration to setup correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/" target="_blank"&gt;Unison&lt;/a&gt; – Developed by the University of Pennslyvania, Unison is similar to rsync and has been around for a while. It works on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WinSCP&lt;/a&gt; – Mainly a SFTP and FTP transfer client for Windows, however, it also has the ability for directory synchronization in semi and fully automatic ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerfolder-/" target="_blank"&gt;PowerFolder&lt;/a&gt; – Easier to use for those that are not technically inclined. Securely sync, share, backup and transfer files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://directorysync.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Directory Synchronize (DirSync)&lt;/a&gt; – Very light-weight utility packed with lots of options for file and folder synchronization. Synchronize from PC to USB stick to PDA, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ifolder.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iFolder&lt;/a&gt; – Developed by Novell in 2001, iFolder is a cross-platform file synching application. Can synchronize one folder to multiple computers with different operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jfilesync.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"&gt;JFileSync&lt;/a&gt; – Used to sync files between two directories, either on one computer, between two computers, or between a computer and another storage device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fullsync.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"&gt;FullSync&lt;/a&gt; – A universal file synchronization and backup utility that is highly customizable and expandable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://opensync.org/" target="_blank"&gt;OpenSync&lt;/a&gt; – Used to sync PIM data such as contacts, calendar, tasks, and notes between a personal computer and mobile device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.conduit-project.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Conduit&lt;/a&gt; – If you’re using GNOME, Conduit is an open source app to synchronize files, photos, emails, contacts, etc to another computer or device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeware Apps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.syncexp.com/wp/" target="_blank"&gt;SyncEXPERT&lt;/a&gt; – Extremely easy to use Windows tool to synchronize data between desktop computers, laptops, USB drives, and any other Microsoft storage device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://allwaysync.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Allway Sync&lt;/a&gt; – Free file and folder synchronization program with a multi-lingual interface and support for true folder synchronization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/downloads.html" target="_blank"&gt;SyncBack&lt;/a&gt; – Older version is free and has basic file backup and synchronization tools. Easy to use and supports encryption and compression. &lt;/p&gt;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sync.bmp" alt="sync" title="sync" align="right" class="alignright size-full wp-image-30271" /><em>This is a guest post by Aseem Kishore, a technology enthusiast and lead blogger for <a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/" target="_blank">Online-Tech-Tips</a>.</em></p>
<p>The amount of important data that we now store digitally on our desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and PDA’s is growing exponentially every year and accessing that data whenever we want from wherever we want is not an easy task. So whether you have GB’s of family pictures and music stored on your computer or lots of MS Office documents with critical business data, here’s a list of over 30 resources to sync your data between computers and mobile devices so you can have ubiquitous access. </p>
<p>You’ll find the list of file synchronization tools broken down into three main categories: open source, freeware, and commercial. Note that even though these file and folder synchronization tools store your data in more than one place, they would not be considered data backup solutions. File synchronization means that when you add, change, or delete a file from one location, the program will perform the same operation at the other location. Hence each copy of the data is the latest copy. </p>
<p>Are you using any of these file synchronization tools? If so, which one do you like the best?</p>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;CNBC is reporting that Microsoft and Facebook have signed a search and advertising deal. The partnership involves integrating Microsoft Live Search on Facebook, which will include the software giant’s search advertising.  Microsoft Live Search will launch on Facebook sometime this fall, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Microsoft serves contextual advertising on Facebook, and the company made a &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2007/10/24/facebook-microsoft-google/"&gt;$240 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in the social network back in October.   At the time, it was unclear whether or not search was part of the deal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySpace has a &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2006/08/07/google-will-power-myspace-search/"&gt;similar deal with Google&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a guaranteed $900 million in revenue to the News Corp-owned social network.  That partnership has had lukewarm results so far for Google, who has indicated during its quarterly earnings announcements that it is struggling to effectively monetize social networking inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These deals are par for the course for most big online media companies.  For example, in addition to its MySpace deal, Google powers search on sites like AOL and The Washington Post, while Yahoo powers search at former Web 1.0 darling Lycos.  While most people ultimately keep searching via their service of choice, the law of huge numbers means that at least a few people will do their Google, Yahoo, or Live searches via a partner site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the MySpace deal is just a simple implementation of Google search under MySpace branding.  What will be interesting to see is if the social networks begin to do innovative things with social search by leveraging your friends list.  Yahoo recently released Build Your Own Search Service (BOSS) to allow developers to do just that, with &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/09/medium-social-search/"&gt;Me.dium signing on&lt;/a&gt; as an initial partner.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;So you’re a real-estate agent or a homeowner toughing a sales effort on your own, and you are interested in going above and beyond the requisite listing of photos, overview, and geo-tagging. Maybe you want to work in a little video slideshow for shoppers. If so, &lt;a href="http://www.propertypreviews.com" target="_blank"&gt;PropertyPreviews&lt;/a&gt; is a free service that automates the process of creating such clips without need for any software downloads. Just upload your images, include any relevant information, and the service will do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also send your video tour off to a number of real estate listing services and video sharing sites of your choosing, including &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/10/trulia-funding/"&gt;Trulia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/04/02/zillow-marketplace/"&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/category/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Agents can place videos on their own websites if so desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though PropertyPreviews general manager Jeff Harris touts the service as offering a sort of 24-hour open house, suffice it to say that you won’t be awed by its powers. Magic is minimal, but for a good number of users, it’s likely to do what it needs to regardless. It cost nil to the user, after all, so if anything, it provides just a bit of extra window dressing if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of warning. While PropertyPreviews proudly displays generic samples on its front page, it does so with an unfortunate selection of music. What’s more, it appears that the service itself mandates the addition of an audio track. Silent playback isn’t an option. So choose wisely!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing as how Web services today are becoming more and more multi-faceted and multi-functional, particularly in the social networking and social media space, it really is open to debate what is and what is not part of a specific segment of the market. Where blogging starts and where networking ends, for instance, is a gray area that has grown ever larger with time. Mobile utilities in particular have evolved to contain powerful assets that accomplish several tasks at once. Perhaps nothing better exemplifies this fact than the items which can now be found within Apple&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/11/iphone-app-store-will-kill-web-apps/"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, where the supply of downloads for the iPhone (and its slightly-less-phenomenal sibling, the iPod touch) expand with each passing week. So we focus today on that very storefront, to determine which applications now available can help to best enable mobile blogging in all its myriad forms and purposes, wherever cellular, Wi-Fi, and/or GPS signals might be found.Good ol&amp;#8217; run-of-the-mill blogging: TypePad and WordPressIf we burrow down to the core of the blogging world, there are several platforms which sport robust frameworks, and many of them are free to use. &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/07/wordpress-compatible-plugins/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, TypePad, Blogger, &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/03/15/windows-live-spaces-fall/"&gt;Live Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, are just a few that sport mass userships and audiences. But only two currently reside as native, officially-released applications within the iPhone/iPod touch paradigm. They are, as we noted recently, &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/06/09/typepad-iphone-3g/"&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/22/wordpress-iphone-app/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress arrived with its own utility after TypePad had introduced itself to users. Both have received good reviews so far. And why not, really. Both aptly manage the basic tasks of posting and editing blogs, and each enables the user to upload photos from a library or take new images via the iPhone&amp;#8217;s onboard camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/22/wordpress-iphone-app/"&gt;offered my own impressions&lt;/a&gt; about both applications, and happen to favor TypePad&amp;#8217;s application a bit more than the WordPress release because TypePad provides support for English and French, but both essentially get the same job done similarly well. Neither path will lead you astray. Quite honestly, as I said before, one&amp;#8217;s choice of application will naturally fall to whichever platform one prefers as it appears on the desktop, and whether one has invested much time in either setting.Micro-bloggingThere are even more choices in the microblogging realm, and if photos are one&amp;#8217;s main source of intrigue, the list is even more voluminous. So let&amp;#8217;s dig in. To start, there are the Twitter-specific applications: &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/09/native-iphone-3g-apps/"&gt;Twitterific&lt;/a&gt;, available for free and ad-supported [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540316&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]; or as a paid-for premium version [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284542696&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]; &lt;a href="http://www.stone.com/Twittelator/" target="_blank"&gt;Twittelator&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284698706&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]; and &lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284967867&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;Twinkle&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284967867&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences, coupled with feedback from others tells me Twitterific is the most pleasant, as it has the benefit of housing a browser within. If you&amp;#8217;re one to click on URLs posted by friends, this is definitely a convenient feature. And in my trials, it has proven quite reliable. It is most useful due to the fact that it makes any transfer out of Twitterific and into Safari Mobile unnecessary. Once you&amp;#8217;ve taken a look at whatever webpage you were directed to, you can close the browser and immediately carry on with reading incoming feeds. No need to repetitively enter and exit applications.Twinkle is aesthetically pleasing, no doubt, and it adds a location dimension to facilitate conversation among users within a given area. But the application has been known to crash regularly. According to Tapulous, Inc, the creator of Twinkle, an update should arrive this Friday, July 25, to fix bugs and &amp;#8220;other minor problems.&amp;#8221;Miscellaneous and (even more) multi-functionalHere&amp;#8217;s where it all comes down to personal tastes and desires. Some applications will connect you to numerous services for easy, synchronized posting. Others will help you satisfy only your tendencies as a photo blogger. Some will help you connect with friends, micro-blog a bit, and even post duplicate hellos and how-are-yous to Twitter. That&amp;#8217;s because&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; it all comes back to Twitter, doesn&amp;#8217;t it? Without further adieu, here are some items for your consideration listed in no particularly prearranged order.&lt;a href="http://lifecast.sleepydog.net/" target="_blank"&gt;LifeCast&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284848260&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: Manage your day&amp;#8217;s events in organized fashion. Want to keep what you do for work and for play exclusive? No problem. LifeCast is about keeping things tidy. Also, non-English speakers will enjoy its slightly multi-lingual reach. French, German, Italian, and Spanish are all supported. Also, if you&amp;#8217;d like to post text to &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/06/27/blogger-new-features/"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, you may. The same goes for &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/05/29/twitter-uses-tumblr-for-status-blog/"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; (photos, too). Geo-tagging comes with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.www.bluepulse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bluepulse&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284983927&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: We gave this &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/16/bluepulse-iphone/"&gt;a brief review&lt;/a&gt; some days ago. And while it wasn&amp;#8217;t my personal cup of tea, it&amp;#8217;s something that others have shown an affinity for. If you&amp;#8217;d like something Twitter-esque (with a Twitter connection, to boot), albeit in a way that allows you to message multiple people of your choosing &amp;#8212; rather than, say, everyone on your friends and followers list(s) &amp;#8212; this one&amp;#8217;s a treat. The layout may take some getting used to, though. It appears designed to make existing Bluepulse users comfortable when making &amp;#8220;the switch.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shozu.com/" target="_blank"&gt;ShoZu&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284768495&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: If this one were to be described in a single word (not yet recognized by the grammar police), it would no doubt be &amp;#8220;awesomeness.&amp;#8221; You need only look at the list of supported sites and services to get a grasp on what this &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/04/03/boxnet-shozu/"&gt;ShoZu&lt;/a&gt; is all about. It is the Swiss Army knife of online social interaction (so far as photo uploads and status updates and things are concerned, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pownce.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Pownce&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540392&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: Despite what the heads at &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/05/08/pownce-publicly-share-files-via-lifestreams-why-not/"&gt;Pownce&lt;/a&gt; say, this one&amp;#8217;s original intent was most definitely to give Twitter a little slap-slap. Which seemed like it might&amp;#8217;ve been possible, until it didn&amp;#8217;t. For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, it&amp;#8217;s still a nifty service. If you want it on your iPhone, the download is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kyte.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Kyte&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=282906319&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: Mobile photo blogging is super cool, for sure. But mobile slideshow blogging is exponentially more kick-ass. &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/06/23/jonas-brothers-bebo-kyte/"&gt;Kyte&lt;/a&gt; makes that happen. For this one you might need to take a few minutes to craft something nice, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.clowdy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Clowdy Photo Blogger&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942702&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: The name says it all. It also lets you see photos taken &amp;#8220;nearby&amp;#8221; to where you stand. A number of downloads currently available in the App Store do this as well, but Clowdy works the photo realm exclusively. It&amp;#8217;s free, and it&amp;#8217;s all of 0.1MB large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://graffit.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Graffitio&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284973646&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;]: This operates with the same location-based concept as Clowdy, but it&amp;#8217;s text-based. The best way to explain it is to offer an example. Say you&amp;#8217;re at a restaurant. You can check Graffitio to see if a Facebook-like &amp;#8220;wall&amp;#8221; has been created for the place. If so, you can post a public message to it. If a wall doesn&amp;#8217;t exist, create one. If enough people participate in the experiment and visit various locations regularly, it starts to become a rather interesting series of whiteboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/category/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, the Web&amp;#8217;s largest social network (arguably) &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/10/myspace-facebook-iphone/"&gt;has its own application&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes], as many have already learned, and in some respects, it&amp;#8217;s about blogging, too. If you&amp;#8217;re one to routinely update your status, and your friends do too, what&amp;#8217;s to say you all aren&amp;#8217;t blogging? And with &lt;a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/19/facebook-iphone-2/"&gt;the recent update&lt;/a&gt; to the application, introduced late last week, you can post to your own wall as well as those of friends. Upload photos seamlessly too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30243 alignright" style="float: right;" title="iphoneappstore" src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphoneappstore.jpg" alt="" width="122" height="217" />Seeing as how Web services today are becoming more and more multi-faceted and multi-functional, particularly in the social networking and social media space, it really is open to debate what is and what is not part of a specific segment of the market. Where blogging starts and where networking ends, for instance, is a gray area that has grown ever larger with time. Mobile utilities in particular have evolved to contain powerful assets that accomplish several tasks at once. <br id="c7mg" /><br id="c7mg0" />Perhaps nothing better exemplifies this fact than the items which can now be found within Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/11/iphone-app-store-will-kill-web-apps/">App Store</a>, where the supply of downloads for the iPhone (and its slightly-less-phenomenal sibling, the iPod touch) expand with each passing week. So we focus today on that very storefront, to determine which applications now available can help to best enable mobile blogging in all its myriad forms and purposes, wherever cellular, Wi-Fi, and/or GPS signals might be found.<br id="sasr" /><br id="sasr0" /><strong>Good ol&#8217; run-of-the-mill blogging: TypePad and WordPress</strong><br id="q0k_" /><br id="q0k_0" />If we burrow down to the core of the blogging world, there are several platforms which sport robust frameworks, and many of them are free to use. <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/07/wordpress-compatible-plugins/">WordPress</a>, TypePad, Blogger, <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/03/15/windows-live-spaces-fall/">Live Spaces</a>, are just a few that sport mass userships and audiences. But only two currently reside as native, officially-released applications within the iPhone/iPod touch paradigm. They are, as we noted recently, <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/06/09/typepad-iphone-3g/">TypePad</a> and <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/22/wordpress-iphone-app/">Wordpress</a>. </p>
<p>WordPress arrived with its own utility after TypePad had introduced itself to users. Both have received good reviews so far. And why not, really. Both aptly manage the basic tasks of posting and editing blogs, and each enables the user to upload photos from a library or take new images via the iPhone&#8217;s onboard camera.</p>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30248" title="iphoneblogging" src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphoneblogging.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="324" /><br />
<br id="wgag0" />I have already <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/22/wordpress-iphone-app/">offered my own impressions</a> about both applications, and happen to favor TypePad&#8217;s application a bit more than the WordPress release because TypePad provides support for English and French, but both essentially get the same job done similarly well. Neither path will lead you astray. Quite honestly, as I said before, one&#8217;s choice of application will naturally fall to whichever platform one prefers as it appears on the desktop, and whether one has invested much time in either setting.<br id="w_g9" /><br id="w_g90" /><strong>Micro-blogging</strong><br id="w_g91" /><br id="w_g92" />There are even more choices in the microblogging realm, and if photos are one&#8217;s main source of intrigue, the list is even more voluminous. So let&#8217;s dig in. To start, there are the Twitter-specific applications: <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/07/09/native-iphone-3g-apps/">Twitterific</a>, available for free and ad-supported [<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540316&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>]; or as a paid-for premium version [<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284542696&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>]; <a href="http://www.stone.com/Twittelator/" target="_blank">Twittelator</a> [<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284698706&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>]; and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284967867&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Twinkle</a> [<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284967867&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>].</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30250" title="twitter-iphone" src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/twitter-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="215" /></p>
<p>My experiences, coupled with feedback from others tells me Twitterific is the most pleasant, as it has the benefit of housing a browser within. <br id="e:8u" /><br id="e:8u0" />If you&#8217;re one to click on URLs posted by friends, this is definitely a convenient feature. And in my trials, it has proven quite reliable. It is most useful due to the fact that it makes any transfer out of Twitterific and into Safari Mobile unnecessary. Once you&#8217;ve taken a look at whatever webpage you were directed to, you can close the browser and immediately carry on with reading incoming feeds. No need to repetitively enter and exit applications.<br id="e:8u1" /><br id="e:8u2" />Twinkle is aesthetically pleasing, no doubt, and it adds a location dimension to facilitate conversation among users within a given area. But the application has been known to crash regularly. According to Tapulous, Inc, the creator of Twinkle, an update should arrive this Friday, July 25, to fix bugs and &#8220;other minor problems.&#8221;<br id="yb2t" /><br id="yb2t0" /><strong>Miscellaneous and (even more) multi-functional</strong><br id="i_b2" /><br id="i_b20" />Here&#8217;s where it all comes down to personal tastes and desires. Some applications will connect you to numerous services for easy, synchronized posting. Others will help you satisfy only your tendencies as a photo blogger. Some will help you connect with friends, micro-blog a bit, and even post duplicate hellos and how-are-yous to Twitter. That&#8217;s because&#8230; well&#8230; it all comes back to Twitter, doesn&#8217;t it? Without further adieu, here are some items for your consideration listed in no particularly prearranged order.<br id="e_l2" /><br id="e_l20" /><a href="http://lifecast.sleepydog.net/" target="_blank">LifeCast</a> [<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284848260&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>]: Manage your day&#8217;s events in organized fashion. Want to keep what you do for work and for play exclusive? No problem. LifeCast is about keeping things tidy. Also, non-English speakers will enjoy its slightly multi-lingual reach. French, German, Italian, and Spanish are all supported. Also, if you&#8217;d like to post text to <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/06/27/blogger-new-features/">Blogger</a>, you may. The same goes for <a href="http://www.mashable.com/2008/05/29/twitter-uses-tumblr-for-status-blog/">Tumblr</a> (photos, too). Geo-tagging comes with.</p>

And while it wasn&#8217;t my personal cup of tea, it&#8217;s something that others have shown an affinity for. If you&#8217;d like something Twitter-esque (with a Twitter connection, to boot), albeit in a way that allows you to message multiple people of your choosing &#8212; rather than, say, everyone on your friends and followers list(s) &#8212; this one&#8217;s a treat. The layout may take some getting used to, though. It appears designed to make existing Bluepulse users comfortable when making &#8220;the switch.&#8221;</p>

It is the Swiss Army knife of online social interaction (so far as photo uploads and status updates and things are concerned, anyway).</p>

Which seemed like it might&#8217;ve been possible, until it didn&#8217;t. For what it&#8217;s worth, it&#8217;s still a nifty service. If you want it on your iPhone, the download is available.</p>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;When major companies emerge in the technology industry, there’s no indication of what may come of them.  Will they go the way of Google and become an online powerhouse?  Or will they go the way of countless other online properties that get sold off to the highest bidder?  Either way, it doesn’t matter: in the end, somebody makes it big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, not everything is so clear-cut.  The company is huge, sure, but it’s also huge in a sector that’s dictated by fickle users that would gladly move to the next bigger, better, cooler thing at the drop of a hat.  That said, it’s also a huge company that should enjoy around &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/02/01/facebook-valuation/"&gt;$350 million in revenue&lt;/a&gt; this year and has a (foolhardy) valuation of about $15 billion, according to Microsoft’s estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Facebook is also the world’s most popular social network even though MySpace still leads the US market, and as more users jump on-board each day, it’s becoming an increasingly valuable property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, it’s time for Zuckerberg and the rest of his cronies to forego his faulty hope of an IPO and sell Facebook to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Facebook is at the top of its game.  It’s enjoying exponential growth, its user-base is growing rapidly, and as it adds more advertising and investment deals to its offering, it’s quickly becoming a valuable online property.  And as it becomes an even more valuable property, it becomes an even more attractive target for major companies like Google and Microsoft to acquire for billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while some believe that the growth can last forever and selling now would mean that it gets out of the business too early, I think that mentality is what could see Facebook sell for $500 million instead of $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a generational platform.  Just like AIM was the most popular social tool of the nineties in the US and MySpace was huge a few years ago, Facebook is the new king in the social space.  Right now, it’s cool for high school and college kids to log on to Facebook, send messages to each other, and play the myriad games that make it such a compelling platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as those kids grow up and enter adult life, they will find other tools – much like the AIM and MySpace crowds did – and leave Facebook in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we even think about LiveJournal anymore?  I didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there isn’t a more attractive target online than Facebook.  And with a new generation of kids growing up on messaging, Facebook chats, and friend news feeds, it should enjoy considerable success as it grows with that generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also difficult to argue that it can ever make more than it would right now.  Facebook is the topic of conversation everywhere on the Web and its growth has been truly astounding.  It won’t last forever though, and once something new comes along that is seemingly “cooler,” a mass exodus of &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/01/21/delete-your-myspace-account-day/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; proportions will occur and instead of billions, Zuckerberg might walk away with millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no shame in waking up and realizing that you’ve built a wildly successful company and it’s time to sell before you may want.  Sure, there’s always the possibility that Facebook will be worth ten times as much three years from now, but when you’re playing with a fickle crowd that gets upset with every wrong move, it’s better to err on the side of caution than to see one wrong move totally cripple your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the online space, which is dominated by a select few companies, major firms like Microsoft are trying desperately to establish itself as a force on the Web.  And although it may have waited too long to do it, it’s ready to move right now and its desperation for tons of traffic is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s that formula: fickle users, huge (and valuable) growth, and desperate juggernauts, that makes this the prime time to sell Facebook off and move on.  Rest assured, it’s the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/zuckerberg.bmp" alt="zuckerberg" title="zuckerberg" align="right" class="alignright size-full wp-image-30244" />When major companies emerge in the technology industry, there’s no indication of what may come of them.  Will they go the way of Google and become an online powerhouse?  Or will they go the way of countless other online properties that get sold off to the highest bidder?  Either way, it doesn’t matter: in the end, somebody makes it big.</p>
<p>But when it comes to <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, not everything is so clear-cut.  The company is huge, sure, but it’s also huge in a sector that’s dictated by fickle users that would gladly move to the next bigger, better, cooler thing at the drop of a hat.  That said, it’s also a huge company that should enjoy around <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/02/01/facebook-valuation/">$350 million in revenue</a> this year and has a (foolhardy) valuation of about $15 billion, according to Microsoft’s estimates.</p>
<p>On top of that, Facebook is also the world’s most popular social network even though MySpace still leads the US market, and as more users jump on-board each day, it’s becoming an increasingly valuable property.</p>
<p>But now, it’s time for Zuckerberg and the rest of his cronies to forego his faulty hope of an IPO and sell Facebook to the highest bidder.</p>
<p><span id="more-30223"></span><br />
Simply put, Facebook is at the top of its game.  It’s enjoying exponential growth, its user-base is growing rapidly, and as it adds more advertising and investment deals to its offering, it’s quickly becoming a valuable online property.  And as it becomes an even more valuable property, it becomes an even more attractive target for major companies like Google and Microsoft to acquire for billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And while some believe that the growth can last forever and selling now would mean that it gets out of the business too early, I think that mentality is what could see Facebook sell for $500 million instead of $10 billion.</p>
<p>Facebook is a generational platform.  Just like AIM was the most popular social tool of the nineties in the US and MySpace was huge a few years ago, Facebook is the new king in the social space.  Right now, it’s cool for high school and college kids to log on to Facebook, send messages to each other, and play the myriad games that make it such a compelling platform.</p>
<p><img src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/newfacebook.gif" alt="newfacebook" title="newfacebook" width="450" height="187" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30054" /></p>
<p>But as those kids grow up and enter adult life, they will find other tools – much like the AIM and MySpace crowds did – and leave Facebook in its wake.</p>
<p>Do we even think about LiveJournal anymore?  I didn’t think so.</p>
<p>At this point, there isn’t a more attractive target online than Facebook.  And with a new generation of kids growing up on messaging, Facebook chats, and friend news feeds, it should enjoy considerable success as it grows with that generation.</p>
<p>But it’s also difficult to argue that it can ever make more than it would right now.  Facebook is the topic of conversation everywhere on the Web and its growth has been truly astounding.  It won’t last forever though, and once something new comes along that is seemingly “cooler,” a mass exodus of <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/01/21/delete-your-myspace-account-day/">MySpace</a> proportions will occur and instead of billions, Zuckerberg might walk away with millions.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in waking up and realizing that you’ve built a wildly successful company and it’s time to sell before you may want.  Sure, there’s always the possibility that Facebook will be worth ten times as much three years from now, but when you’re playing with a fickle crowd that gets upset with every wrong move, it’s better to err on the side of caution than to see one wrong move totally cripple your service.</p>
<p>In the online space, which is dominated by a select few companies, major firms like Microsoft are trying desperately to establish itself as a force on the Web.  And although it may have waited too long to do it, it’s ready to move right now and its desperation for tons of traffic is palpable.</p>
<p>And it’s that formula: fickle users, huge (and valuable) growth, and desperate juggernauts, that makes this the prime time to sell Facebook off and move on.  Rest assured, it’s the right decision.</p>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;What can you do in 12 seconds?  You can make a fairly interesting video update.  With new site &lt;a href="http://www.12seconds.tv/" target="_blank"&gt;12seconds&lt;/a&gt;, you can create a video update to share on the Web, through your own channel on the site. Similar to &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2007/03/11/twitter/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s 140 character limit, the video updates on 12seconds are limited to, well, 12 seconds.  It&amp;#8217;s just enough to get the point across, and short enough for easy consumption by viewers.  Creating a video update is easy enough&amp;#8211;just record with your webcam.  There&amp;#8217;s mobile support as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every user receives their very own email address for sending mobile content to their 12seconds account, making it easy enough to create content on the go.  Mobile support was pretty much a necessity for 12seconds, given the target demographic and the current presence of countless updating and microblogging services, both with and without video capabilities.  From &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/04/03/seesmic-acquires-twhirl-for-desktop-video-microblogging/"&gt;Seesmic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2007/06/28/pownce-2/"&gt;Pownce&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of third-party applications that operate off the Twitter ecosystem, it&amp;#8217;s clear that multimedia microblogging is here to stay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the crowded market, I was glad to see that 12seconds also redistributes your content on Twitter, so you can post 12seconds content on other areas of the Web if you&amp;#8217;d like. You can even import your Twitter friends to 12seconds. The good thing about 12seconds&amp;#8217; particular take on the microblogging video industry is that with webcam and its existing mobile support, its service becomes a niche tool for the average user. It encompasses much of the mobile user demographic as opposed to focusing on a smaller group that has a select mobile phone device that utilizes live video streaming capabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cool as live streaming is, there&amp;#8217;s still a large portion of the population that doesn&amp;#8217;t yet have a device to support this, so creating a niche community focused on short-form video updates that caters to both the Web and the mobile community is something easy for a lot of people to latch onto, though I wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind seeing a few more options for the redistribution of content to other blogging and social networking communities across the Web.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also embed options and the expected sharing/following options you&amp;#8217;ll see on most microblogging sites, so there&amp;#8217;s nothing too unfamiliar here.  If you&amp;#8217;d like a chance to check out 12seconds, click &lt;a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB2283C55RV87" http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB2283C55RV87&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to fill out a questionnaire in order to receive your account.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;The British lawmakers and ISPs are now seriously mulling the idea of a &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/music-industry-to-tax-downloaders-875757.html" target="_blank"&gt;preemptive piracy tax&lt;/a&gt;; a yearly fee that would be imposed on everyone who uses the Internet - say, 30 pounds - collected by the ISPs, and given back to the artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve already written about &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/03/14/preemptive-piracy-tax/"&gt;this proposal and its stupidity&lt;/a&gt;; now I&amp;#8217;d like to explore the funny side of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to imply that all artists are drug-taking, booze-gurgling, room-trashing fiends, but I think I can safely say that some of them are well-known for a lavish, extravagant, expensive and debaucherous lifestyle. Lenny Kravitz, for example, will be playing near me soon, and the organizers hired a somewhat famous fashion designer to design the interior of his wardrobe, because he wants it &amp;#8220;funky and cool&amp;#8221;. This stuff costs a lot of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without going into details of who owes what to whom and what&amp;#8217;s fair (I&amp;#8217;ve explored that in the previous article), simply think of this ridiculous situation. Do they really expect that a granny from Sussex will pay a yearly fee to use the Internet, which will go into the hands of artists (the most popular of which are burning more money by the minute than our granny receives in a month), just because the music industry is &amp;#8220;in trouble&amp;#8221; because of &amp;#8220;illegal file sharing&amp;#8221;? Is she a &amp;#8220;regular downloader&amp;#8221; if her grandson sends her a link to a music video? What does all this taxation business have to do with her? Or anyone who&amp;#8217;s merely using the Internet and doesn&amp;#8217;t really care about the latest Duran Duran comeback, or perhaps music in general?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, is the music industry really doing some special favor to the world that everyone needs to pay them a fixed tax, no matter how much and in what way they consume their products? What about writers? Actors? Software engineers? Anyone who creates any sort of work that can be easily copied and shared over the Internet? Who decides on who gets the biggest share? And how do you compare Keith Richards to, say, William Gibson?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still hoping that the lawmakers will understand that a music tax is a preposterous idea, impossible to implement in a fair way, and it should never see the light of day. If it does; well, I guess we&amp;#8217;ll learn to laugh and cry at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m surprised it even took this long for this to happen. Developers have swarmed so fast to write the coolest iPhone application that privacy and security concerns were probably not a high priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo reports that an RPG game called &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5028459/aurora-feint-iphone-app-delisted-for-lousy-security-practices" target="_blank"&gt;Aurora Feint has been delisted&lt;/a&gt; from the Apple store for bad security practices. The offense? The game takes your entire contact list and sends it unencrypted to their servers. The developers &lt;a href="http://aurorafeint.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=crash&amp;#038;action=display&amp;#038;thread=346" target="_blank"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that their intents have been noble: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we discovered that the Apple SDK allowed us to look through your contact list we thought it would be a great idea to automatically show you which friends are playing the game. Why automatically? Well, everyone always complains about the keyboard on the iPhone and how annoying it is to type on it. So we thought, &amp;#8220;Hey, why don&amp;#8217;t we make this feature REALLY easy to use – no typing!&amp;#8221; And such, the community feature was born. Some people have said that it would have been ok if we had a better notice explaining what was going on. I agree! We weren&amp;#8217;t trying to be sneaky about how this worked. It was just overlooked. No one we showed it to even asked a question about it – nor did we. It just simply never came up as a potential issue when we beta tested the game with early users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no one thought that taking your entire contact list, and sending it unencrypted to their servers is a privacy/security problem? Doh. Luckily, Apple obviously has a team that looks for omissions such as these. Unfortunately, this incident strengthens the argument that Apple needs to have strict control over iPhone apps, and I prefer to have a choice on the matter - even if it means I can kiss my security and privacy goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Spanish speakers who are using &lt;a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; will be happy to know that this business social network now &lt;a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2008/07/linkedin-la-r-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;supports two languages: English and Spanish&lt;/a&gt;. You can choose the language from the drop down menu at the upper right hand side on the homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move is on par to what other social networks (with more funding) have been doing for some time; Facebook, for example, is also available in &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/02/07/facebook-spanish/"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, while MySpace is available in &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2007/10/14/myspace-brazil-russia-poland-india/"&gt;several languages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest beefs most folks have with NetFlix as an alternative to traditional forms of livingroom-based entertainment is that their on-demand selection is somewhat limited in nature (actually, &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/02/roku-youtube/#comment-1069455"&gt;recent Mashable commenter &amp;#8220;Cody&amp;#8221; remarked&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;#8220;the online/stream selection was just plain miserable&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miserable might be an overstatement, but unfortunately dated and small is fairly accurate.  Their collection of on demand movies and TV series is limited to 10,000 titles, many of them B-Rated movies or flicks you&amp;#8217;ve likely seen a few times already. Still, the on-demand service combined with the convenience of the Roku box is something I&amp;#8217;ve salivated over quite a bit, both over the coolness factor and the promise of what it could mean for the future of online video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetFlix has their hands in other honey-pots as well, though they seem to be in the process of extricating themselves from some of these side-ventures.  One such venture is Red Envelope Entertainment, the documentary investment arm of NetFlix responsible for such blockbusters as &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492487/"&gt;Small Town Gay Bar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762117/"&gt;Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386757/"&gt;Running with Arnold.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those were the most absurd titles I could find in the 100 film line-up of Red Envelope, the documentary investment arm of the company did surprisingly well, with &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;sid=aCynTzP.WKpY" target="_blank"&gt;Piper Jaffrey analysts estimating gross revenues&lt;/a&gt; around $10-30 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Albrecht &lt;a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/23/netflix-rightly-ditches-film-funding/" target="_blank"&gt;says today over at NewTeeVee&lt;/a&gt; that NetFlix was right to ditch their attempt at running a studio.  From a business perspective, this may or may not be true, but for the reasons he gives it just doesn&amp;#8217;t scan for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix doesn’t need to be in the business of finding little films that could. Yes, it was great that it funded documentaries, but the movie rental company has much bigger fish to fry, and companies such as &lt;a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/21/snagfilms-best-thing-for-docs-since-netflix/" target="_blank"&gt;Snagfilms&lt;/a&gt; are stepping up to distribute documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix’s biggest priority has to be getting more content for its online streaming services. &lt;a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/14/roku-netflixbox-and-the-future-of-tv/#comment-241171" target="_blank"&gt;Stacey’s predictions&lt;/a&gt; about the dearth of “Watch Instantly” content have come true, and after two weeks with the Netflix-streaming Roku box, I’m left to choose between watching old episodes of Buck Rogers or 100 Sailing Mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it has that problem licked, Netflix can then focus on its content delivery and start &lt;a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/18/i-want-my-i-want-my-hd-stream/" target="_blank"&gt;streaming in HD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the glaringly obvious fact that &amp;#8220;Watch Instantly&amp;#8221; is far from dead, isn&amp;#8217;t finding and creating unique content working to solve the problem of not having enough unique and interesting content on the service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I&amp;#8217;d love to have the online videos in HD.  Absolutely I&amp;#8217;d love to have more mainstream movies and TV on the on-demand service quicker. Ending unique production investment seems counter to Chris&amp;#8217;s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had my druthers, I&amp;#8217;d encourage NetFlix to invest in and forge relationships even more with alternative content providers.  The seeds have been sewn to take their on-demand services and throw them to the livingroom.  Garner more compelling and unique content by striking deals with episodic content producers. It&amp;#8217;ll create incentive for Internet video producers to keep producing, and it&amp;#8217;ll turn the uber-simple Roku device into the new cable-box.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>NetFlix has their hands in other honey-pots as well, though they seem to be in the process of extricating themselves from some of these side-ventures.  One such venture is Red Envelope Entertainment, the documentary investment arm of NetFlix responsible for such blockbusters as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492487/">Small Town Gay Bar</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762117/">Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386757/">Running with Arnold.</a></p>
<p>While those were the most absurd titles I could find in the 100 film line-up of Red Envelope, the documentary investment arm of the company did surprisingly well, with <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aCynTzP.WKpY" target="_blank">Piper Jaffrey analysts estimating gross revenues</a> around $10-30 million.</p>
<p><span id="more-30227"></span><br />
Chris Albrecht <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/23/netflix-rightly-ditches-film-funding/" target="_blank">says today over at NewTeeVee</a> that NetFlix was right to ditch their attempt at running a studio.  From a business perspective, this may or may not be true, but for the reasons he gives it just doesn&#8217;t scan for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Netflix doesn’t need to be in the business of finding little films that could. Yes, it was great that it funded documentaries, but the movie rental company has much bigger fish to fry, and companies such as <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/21/snagfilms-best-thing-for-docs-since-netflix/" target="_blank">Snagfilms</a> are stepping up to distribute documentaries.</p>
<p>Netflix’s biggest priority has to be getting more content for its online streaming services. <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/14/roku-netflixbox-and-the-future-of-tv/#comment-241171" target="_blank">Stacey’s predictions</a> about the dearth of “Watch Instantly” content have come true, and after two weeks with the Netflix-streaming Roku box, I’m left to choose between watching old episodes of <em>Buck Rogers</em> or <em>100 Sailing Mistakes</em>.</p>
<p>Once it has that problem licked, Netflix can then focus on its content delivery and start <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/07/18/i-want-my-i-want-my-hd-stream/" target="_blank">streaming in HD</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><img align="right" class="alignright size-full wp-image-29118" title="netflix_roku_streaming" src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/netflix_roku_streaming.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Aside from the glaringly obvious fact that &#8220;Watch Instantly&#8221; is far from dead, isn&#8217;t finding and creating unique content working to solve the problem of not having enough unique and interesting content on the service?</p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;d love to have the online videos in HD.  Absolutely I&#8217;d love to have more mainstream movies and TV on the on-demand service quicker. Ending unique production investment seems counter to Chris&#8217;s arguments.</p>
<p>If I had my druthers, I&#8217;d encourage NetFlix to invest in and forge relationships even <em>more</em> with alternative content providers.  The seeds have been sewn to take their on-demand services and throw them to the livingroom.  Garner more compelling and unique content by striking deals with episodic content producers. It&#8217;ll create incentive for Internet video producers to keep producing, and it&#8217;ll turn the uber-simple Roku device into the new cable-box.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Back in April, we had Keith Richman on Mashable Conversations to talk about the formation of the ROI council.  Keith is the CEO of Break.com, and a genuinely knowlegable person to talk to when it comes to the broad topic of the business of online video. That&amp;#8217;s why I was thrilled when he dropped us a line to let us know about an innovative advertising campaign being undertaken by Break Media in conjunction with Samsung for their new Instinct smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign isn&amp;#8217;t at all a pre-roll, post-roll , overlay, or any other type of typical video campaign - the campaign is the video. They&amp;#8217;re basically a series of entertaining demostrations of the device in play and usage (and you&amp;#8217;ll be surprised when you &lt;a href="http://www.break.com/samsung-instinct" target="_blank"&gt;see the clarity&lt;/a&gt; with which it is able to record, as a side note). More importantly for our interests (since we&amp;#8217;re not a gadget blog), it&amp;#8217;s a neat and interesting new way to monetize your video content and video brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we had Keith on the line, we took the time to pick his brain over some points Steven Hodson brought up in his recent editoral: &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/16/video-blogging-future/"&gt;Video Blogging is Not the Frontier You Might Expect&lt;/a&gt;. In that piece, Steven explored the trials and tribulations of creating video content in today&amp;#8217;s New Media landscape, and we got some great examples from Keith of video producers he thinks are &amp;#8220;doing it right.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook made several important announcements to kickoff its F8 developer conference this afternoon: the launch of &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/facebook-connect-launches/"&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/facebook-great-apps-program/"&gt;Great Apps&lt;/a&gt; program for preferred applications, and the ability for developers to &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/facebook-translations-for-developers/"&gt;translate their applications&lt;/a&gt; into different languages.  However, a few things that developers and onlookers thought Facebook might announce didn’t come to pass.  Here’s a look at a few of them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment System – There was a fair amount of speculation that Facebook would announce a payment system to allow developers to monetize their applications.  Facebook made no mention of this, and didn’t touch on monetization throughout the keynote.    Meanwhile, some developers are already starting to integrate their own payment options, including &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/23/playfish-social-gaming/"&gt;Playfish&lt;/a&gt;, which I profiled this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising Program for Developers – While Facebook has made it clear that no advertising will be permitted outside of application canvas pages in a &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/21/facebook-platform-policies/"&gt;new set of platform policies&lt;/a&gt; issued earlier this week, there was no announcement of plans for Facebook to launch its own revenue share program for developers to monetize their apps.  This is good news for the dozens of advertising networks currently selling inventory for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for OpenID – Following MySpace’s announcement yesterday that they &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/22/myspace-launches-data-availability-on-flixster-and-eventful/"&gt;will support OpenID&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed possible that Facebook may at least become an identity provider, if not the first big social network to actually let users login using the standard.   No such announcement was made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finances – While Facebook shared a lot of numbers, including announcing that it has passed 90 million active users worldwide, there was no mention of the company’s overall financial performance.  However, they did note that more than $200 million has been invested in Facebook application developers - $34 million of which came this week with venture capital investments in Zynga and LivingSocial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the focus of this year’s F8 is on the Facebook re-design, its implications for developers, and moving the platform in the direction of creating a better end user experience.   But short of Facebook Connect, which everyone knew was coming, there was certainly no “wow factor” in today’s announcements of the magnitude of last year’s platform launch.  What do you think?  Pleased or disappointed with the Facebook announcements?   Voice your opinions in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook has announced the “&lt;a href="http://developers.new.facebook.com/greatapps.php" target="_blank"&gt;Great Apps Program&lt;/a&gt;,” a developer offering that gives certain applications “greater visibility on Facebook, earlier access to new features and more feedback from Facebook.”  The initial partners for Great Apps are &lt;a href="http://apps.new.facebook.com/causes/about" target="_blank"&gt;Causes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ilike.com/" target="_blank"&gt;iLike&lt;/a&gt;.  It will open to everyone else in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, Facebook is launching the “&lt;a href="http://developers.new.facebook.com/verification.php" target="_blank"&gt;Application Verification Program&lt;/a&gt;” – also available in September – that will allow developers to receive official certification from the social network and gain added visibility.    According to Facebook, the program will “offer extra assurances to help users identify applications they can trust &amp;#8212; applications that are secure, respectful and transparent, and have demonstrated commitment to compliance with Platform policies.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Facebook has announced a fresh $10 million that they will infuse into a second round of the fbFund.  Simultaneously, they are announcing the following winners of the first round of funding for application developers:  CourseFeed by Classtop, GoalCamp, HotBerry, J2Play, LuckyCal, MyListo, Podclass, Trazzler, and &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2007/04/15/zimride/"&gt;Zimride Carpool App&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
