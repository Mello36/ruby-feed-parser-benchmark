<p>I have waited all my life to see such a moment happen, and the last 4 years to see obama to become elected president.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit late and i feel so excited and ready to sleep (I am in Paris).</p>
<p>I agree with Arianna (Huffington), the internet was the number tool for winning this election. What i would like to see is how Obama will leverage theese millions of people involved in his online campain to help adress and solve the incredibly hard issues that the Us face : global terrorism, climate change, decline of the US, the worse crisis of the century, health care, China,&#8230;</p>
<p>I have the feeling that nothing will be the same anymore, and I love that feeling.</p>
<p>Good night and welcome to the 21th century</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.tariqkrim.com/2008/06/03/my-new-role-at-netvibes/"><![CDATA[<p>As of Friday afternoon, I am no longer the CEO of Netvibes. Even though TechCrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/28/netvibes-ceo-steps-down-widget-platform-will-open-up/" target="_blank">broke the story</a>, I wanted to wait until everything was formally done to communicate the news. As promised, it&#8217;s now the time to announce my new role with Netvibes, the company I founded nearly three years ago.</p>
<p>Last week we decided in a board meeting to name Freddy Mini, my second in command, as the new CEO. I am supportive of this decision, which will enable me to have a non-executive role to focus on strategy and the big picture, not on day-to-day issues.  And as one of the largest shareholders of the company, I will continue to sit on the board and support the company to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>I understand that my decision may have come as a surprise to many people people and I apologize for the short notice, but this is something that we had been planning internally for quite a while.<br />
Last year, driving back from a Facebook meeting with Freddy on the 101,  I told him that I would step down before the summer &#8212; once I had the feeling that the company is on the right track. I told him that he should be ready to become the next CEO. Even after looking at other candidates, Freddy was the obvious choice . If someone can bring Netvibes to next level, it&#8217;s him.</p>
<p>Freddy is not the only person that will have new responsibilities: my executive team, Franck who runs the product team and Annabelle my CFO, and my beloved team now has the opportunity to execute our vision for the future of Netvibes.</p>
<p>As I said at the Netvibes.org developer conference in Paris, four things matter to me : the opinion of my team, our users, our clients, and the developer community, and nothing makes me more happy than their commitment to Netvibes. From the bottom of my heart, I thank them for their continuous support.</p>
<p>I have created 7 companies so far, and Netvibes is by far the most international and the one with the largest number of employees. With Netvibes I have always considered myself as a founder CEO.</p>
<p>That means two things: a founder and the first CEO of the company.</p>
<p>As a founder you have to provide the ambition, the vision, and hire the best team possible to do the job. I believe that we have succeeded in doing so. People who are not entrepreneurs sometimes do not fully understand the unbelievable level of commitment you need to create a company.</p>
<p>Before founding Netvibes, I didn&#8217;t know if I was capable of such commitment, dedication, and will for a project. For a project like Netvibes, you have to give everything or it doesn&#8217;t work. You have to believe for yourself and the rest of the world, and provide your team with constant energy, making sure that you can get the best of each person on a daily basis.<br />
You have to channel your doubts into operational focus, because it&#8217;s not where you start that matters but how you can lead your team to fulfill your vision and to the difficult road to success. This is why I have respected and admired entrepreneurs ever since I was a child.</p>
<p>As the founder of Netvibes, I am here to create something that ultimately has meaning: for the market, the team, and clients, but also fundamentally something that has meaning for myself.  It&#8217;s that last factor that truly defines entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>What about strong competition with seemingly unlimited funding and workforce against us? This served as even further motivation to get excited about the project and pursue it despite the related challenges.</p>
<p>As a founder CEO my vision is very simple: you have one mission, make sure that the company executes your vision and that it hires the best people in order to render yourself unnecessary as quickly as possible at the operations level. That is the only advice I would give people, hire people you like and respect and that are much better than you in their areas of expertise. Furthermore, give people a chance to express their full potential because sometimes you will be fascinated by the result.</p>
<p>And one last thing, keeps egos away as fast as you can. The Netvibes team is by far one of the best teams assembled in the web 2.0 world and is still extremely hard working, modest, and funny.</p>
<p>Before handing over the CEO position to Freddy, I wanted to make sure that I had completed my to do list for the company:</p>
<p><strong>An ambitious vision</strong>: a startpage combined with a monetized widget platform that is now the only alternative to google. An elegant alternative to google.</p>
<p><strong>A strong team</strong>: Netvibes has a team  that is 100% committed to the challenge, extremely talented and capable of creating miracles every day. We&#8217;ve had a very low turnover &#8212; 90% the team is still there and still rocking as usual.</p>
<p><strong>A sexy business model</strong>: As Freddy has stated in interviews, Netvibes&#8217;s revenue is increasing every quarter. He expects the company to break even next year and I am fully confident of this. For us, the monetization of Netvibes was never the problem, it&#8217;s how you monetize while respecting the user that is the hard part. You can&#8217;t go for the simplest solution and use the traditional tricks of web 1.0 monetization. But if you find a way to make your user accept sponsored widgets as a suggestion and not an obligation, you have a winner.<br />
The sponsored widgets model is Adsense 2.0 and Netvibes will play a key role in this transformation.</p>
<p>In general I am proud of what we have done and I would change very little of what we did.<br />
It is important to note that decisions are made in a context that is often not public, and that Netvibes has always seemed bigger than it is. Our staff of 35 people is not that big when you think of it.</p>
<p>This is why it  took us more time to deliver what we announced, but we always delivered:</p>
<p>* a complete rewriting of the Netvibes backend to support APIs,<br />
* a new and more flexible front end that can evolve and be more easily improved,<br />
* the public page (Netvibes universe) that is becoming more and more popular every day ,<br />
* our latest product development: the Netvibes activities that will add the much-anticipated social component (an updated version is coming soon),<br />
* the new ecosystem with more tools for developers and better stats,<br />
* the sponsored widget ad network<br />
* and last but not least, our open source widget platform that will provide an incredible opportunity for developers to connect and mash our technology up. I will follow what will come out of this very closely.</p>
<p>In my experience, finding a good business model is not easy: you need to experiment, measure, understand what the client wants, have inventory and drive adoption, all a part of the key knowledge that makes Netvibes invaluable vis-a-vis the widget economy. Freddy and the business team have been instrumental in this phase and it is now the time to unleash the full potential of this opportunity.</p>
<p>With an incredibly dedicated team  we have made all the changes needed to see Netvibes play a major role in the widget economy. The coming challenge is very exciting and I am highly confident that the team will succeed. I will be available to help the team in whatever way possible.</p>
<p>After such a long haul, I will take some time off and start thinking about a new idea of mine. I will also have more personal time, which is not a bad thing <img src='http://www.tariqkrim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> and I will spend more time blogging and observing the world. I will soon travel around the world to meet entrepreneurs and friends alike.<br />
On a very personal note, I want to thank all the people that contacted me and all of the friends that supported me and advised me about this move. I was amazed by the incredible number of supportive emails, and happy to see that some VCs already have interest in my next idea. <img src='http://www.tariqkrim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I will be mindful of timing, and in another post, I&#8217;ll talk about the lessons I learned from starting Netvibes, especially in Europe and running it from Paris. This comes at the request of numerous friends and journalists.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;d like to give a big thanks to the Netvibes friends, team, partners, developers, and users for some of the best years of my life.</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.tariqkrim.com/2008/05/28/about-netvibes-and-widgets-business-model/"><![CDATA[<p>I was last week at the founder’s forum near London, a gathering of internet entrepreneurs hosted by brent (lastminute, mydeco), Johnny Goodwin from Jefferies and Marc Samwer. I was really nice to have time to meet with friends in Europe this time and congratulate Xochi and Michael on their move with Bebo. It is also very interesting to talk with entrepreneurs because you don’t have to convince them about an idea you just have to explain why you are going to make it successful.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about netvibes, the widget economy and new opportunities of this market.</p>
<p>Netvibes is mostly know by the consumer for being the coolest start page on the market, but on the business side, we are known as the company that provide an alternative widget platform to Google gadget. End of this week netvibes will launch a new set of opensource tools will leverage the full potential of netvibes API and platform. It’s a new step in embracing data portability with announced support of oAuth and Openid and cool examples in the mobile. The announcement is happening at <a href="http://dev.netvibes.com/blog/2008/05/27/netvibes-developers-meetup-in-paris/" target="_blank">netvibes developer camp</a> and at <a href="http://www.netvibes.org">netvibes.org</a></p>
<p>One of the interesting discussions we had was regarding opportunities brought by the widget to monetize social web. Europe is still a virgin territory as key services like slide rockyou , clearspring operate mostly in the US. Netvibes is definitely one of the only companies that operate in the widget market in Europe. Even if a large part our netvibes revenues comes from US operations.</p>
<p>Before the introduction of netvibes ginger, netvibes business model was based on selling premium universe (netvibes branded pages) to our partners with monthly license fees. Now in addition, Netvibes Ginger integrates a widget ad networks that enable partners to distribute sponsored widgets. The model is a cost per install or CPI and is auction based. This program is just a few month old and had a great kick start. In netvibes categories in the add content you can see live sponsored placements from amazing brands and media. To have more details about this have a look in our business section (business.netvibes.com) or this <a href="http://www.geste.fr/9_commissions/presentationNETVIBES.pdf" target="_blank">presentation I did for the online French media association</a>.</p>
<p>How big is this market?</p>
<p>Lots of people are wondering <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c968990-2b4c-11dd-a7fc-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1" target="_blank">if we can monetize well  the web 2.0 and social media properties</a>. With traditional ads networks in don’t think so, but I really think that widgets will.</p>
<p>The Widget economy is going to be huge, In 2008 it will be $40M ( I would say $15M in Europe) according emarketer and this is just the beginning .<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/14/social-network-ad-spending-projections-take-a-dip/" target="_blank"> Slow down in ad spending in social media will hurt mostly traditional advertising not widgets and appvertising</a> that bring performance based models and virality.</p>
<p>Expect the rise of the widget economy to happen in the second semester of 2008 and explode in 09. This is great news for netvibes and other widgets platforms. Congrats to Hooman for the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/05/20/widget-infrastructure-company-clearspring-raises-18m/" target="_self">Clearspring new round of financing</a>!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.tariqkrim.com/2008/05/28/5-things-facebook-should-change/"><![CDATA[<p>As almost everyone around, I am a compulsive facebook user, mostly through my netvibes widget and on my mobile. I have passed the 2000 friends and I waiting for some interface and product improvements. Here are my top 5 features needed to make my facebook experience almost perfect:</p>
<p>Add friend process is too complicated:</p>
<p>I really think that facebook should ease the process even more. I still have 700 friends in my waiting list, and to be honest I don&#8217;t know how to process them quickly enough. If you are in that list please do apologize. In my opinion Friendfeed did a great job to add friends and should be a good inspiration point. Agreed with LoicLemeur the new interface is already better, but not perfect.</p>
<p>Search in messages:</p>
<p>As more and more people use messaging system, i have some time to browse 10 pages to find few days’ old messages. This is a real concern because no search means no use for old messages. Why not list messages by authors?</p>
<p>Complete newsfeed history:</p>
<p>Once again I can understand the logic of having people to come back often to access their updated timeline, but Friendfeed and netvibes provide the whole newsfeed from day one. I would love to access that and browse through day one if I can. Make the newsfeed searchable like in netvibes would be a great plus.</p>
<p>A better timeline for mobile:</p>
<p>I love facebook mobile, but I feel frustrated as I don’t see the timeline. I am not talking about the iphone version (mine was replaced by the new blackberry) but the mobile one.</p>
<p>A better way to <span> </span>list friends:</p>
<p>I think that the new design hides a lot of crucial informations. I have to click on a friend to slide and see the information about someone. I liked better the old interface that was also smarter. For example if you don&#8217;t have any one related to you, the option mutual friend did not appear. Now it opens and says you don&#8217;t have any friends in commons. I think again that there&#8217;s room for improvements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I know that new design is coming soon and we will see what will happens.</span> Update, my message was spread internally at Facebook and they are already working on some of theses features, Cool !</p>
<p>And you what are your top 5 facebook improvements ?</p>
