they don&#8217;t go to heaven where the angels fly<br />
they go down to the lake of fire and fry<br />
Won&#8217;t see &#8216;em again till the Fourth of July</p>
<p>I knew a lady who lived in Duluth<br />
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth<br />
but she went to her grave a little too soon<br />
and she flew away howling at the yellow moon</p>
<p>Now the people cry and the people moan<br />
and they look for a dry place to call their home<br />
and try to find some place to rest their bones<br />
while the angels and the devils<br />
fight to claim them for their own</p>

It twists and turns and it curves<br />
The danger that the darkness can give<br />
And the way we always get what we deserve</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna cut to the heart like a razor<br />
Red ribbons will fly high<br />
Cut to the bone<br />
Sunk like a stone<br />
Drunk on the blood red sky (oh yeah)</p>
<p>The train has slipped and fell off the cliff<br />
Swallowed by the monsters below<br />
A puff of smoke is all that is left<br />
Like the ghosts of those that we used to know</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna cut to the heart like a razor<br />
Red ribbons will fly high<br />
Dropped to the ground<br />
Never should have found<br />
Underneath the blood red sky</p>
<p>The fire on her torch it still gleams<br />
To the shadows at the edge of our eyes<br />
Our footsteps through the forest sink<br />
To mute the nightingale&#8217;s reply</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna cut to the heart like a razor<br />
Red ribbons will fly high<br />
Cut to the bone<br />
Sunk like a stone<br />
Left on the ground never to be found<br />
Underneath the blood red sky</p>

stay separated, perfectly fine<br />
Courage is ruthless<br />
His sickly cold hands<br />
with slow moving muscles<br />
a fast talking man<br />
is professing the future<br />
as seen by the stars<br />
layed down far from heaven<br />
and covered in tar </p>
<p>Injected in lymph nodes, inspected and tangled<br />
Attached to the cathode, electrically mangled<br />
The drug is our hero, my only friend<br />
The drug is my favorite means unto the end.</p>
<p>Continued, talked into, coerced by the (full moon?)<br />
The terrorized tough guy is singing a new tune<br />
To hell with them towers, everything crumbles<br />
A well-statued waste land slowly recovers<br />
To carve her good name, and fight a good fight<br />
Suggest our defenses and tuck us in tight<br />
But the drugs are our secret, our heavenly host<br />
Hail Mary, our Father, and Holiest Ghost </p>
<p>His weapons are subtle<br />
His methods obscure<br />
With fast acting poison he’s sure of the cure<br />
The drug is our hero, an Olympian saint<br />
Our medical mentor and easy escape </p>
<p>A pill filled with powder to impart endurance<br />
and fluid filled capsules for osmotic entrance<br />
The body’s a forest, the brain is a spaceship<br />
rendered by molecules aimless and useless<br />
The drug is our hero, it’s number one<br />
The drug is our hero, are we having fun </p>
<p>Kiss me with chemistry<br />
Break my bacteria<br />
Fill up my organs with magic material<br />
The drug is our hero, our warrior king<br />
The drug is the hero of all human beings</p>

their little girl<br />
so she snuck out each night<br />
doing the worst she can<br />
but theres no man<br />
to stop the boy i am<br />
the life in the night<br />
parents would be<br />
so surprised<br />
so surprised<br />
so surprised<br />
so surprised<br />
so surprised</p>

I see it through the door<br />
If I get struck by lightning<br />
My heart won’t beat any more<br />
In other words…<br />
Nothing will change</p>
<p>I went down to the river<br />
The water is turning brown<br />
If the levy breaks<br />
Well I will surely drown<br />
In other words…<br />
Nothing will change</p>
<p>I’m drivin through the field<br />
The field sowed with corn<br />
I saw a dead fox lyin on the side of the road<br />
My baby left me yesterday<br />
She packed up all her clothes<br />
She said that I would never change</p>
<p>This bottle’s almost empty<br />
Yet I cannot catch a buzz<br />
And the radio’s a tragedy of<br />
Country songs and fuzz<br />
In other words…<br />
Nothing will change</p>
<p>The daylight always fails me<br />
There’s no secret he can keep<br />
The midnight will embrace me<br />
But she will not let me sleep<br />
In other words…<br />
Nothing will change</p>
<p>Today there was a thunderstorm<br />
It came in from a far<br />
Lightning bolts came beating down<br />
The earth was burned and scarred<br />
My baby left me yesterday<br />
She drove off in her car<br />
And she said that I will never change</p>
<p>The kitchen clock is tickin<br />
And the faucet’s got a leak<br />
Like that water drippin<br />
I’m on the path that resists the least<br />
In other words…<br />
Nothing changes</p>
<p>Yes I’m fallin to the bottom<br />
The bottom of a hill<br />
Where the rich men build their mansions<br />
And they marry pretty girls<br />
In other words…<br />
Nothing changes</p>
<p>And if I had a little<br />
Of what they got up there<br />
Things would be different if<br />
Life was only fair<br />
My baby’d be beside me now<br />
Together through this storm<br />
There are some things that just cannot change<br />
Some things you cannot change</p>
<p>The night is awfully quiet<br />
There’s no friends I can call<br />
I’m standin on a wooden chair<br />
And if I should fall<br />
Nothing will change<br />
Nothing will change</p>
<p>Yes it’s that which hangs me up<br />
That holds me down<br />
Yes it’s that which holds me up<br />
That holds me down<br />
Yes it’s that which holds me up<br />
That holds me down</p>

I got his picture on a gas can<br />
He’s wanted all across the state<br />
He stole a cow for some rib eye steak<br />
He’s hid himself across the plains<br />
Like a hobo on a boxcar train<br />
He used to work on the golden land<br />
Till his drinkin got out of hand<br />
But now he’s got a brand new plan<br />
He calls himself the hammer man<br />
He hammers north and he hammers south<br />
He hammers by way of word of mouth</p>
<p>Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am yes I am<br />
Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am</p>
<p>Well in this way<br />
He spells it out<br />
USA its our town now<br />
Yours and mine and that fat ol cow<br />
If you want him back you got to shoot me down<br />
So he booked himself in a motel room<br />
And he went to bed under a blood red moon</p>
<p>Well sound asleep and the cops bust in<br />
The seen him sleepin in his dreamy grin<br />
They seen the hammer all tucked in<br />
And they seen the cow and they shout “that’s him!”<br />
The cops lit up and they fired four slugs<br />
And the cow lay bleedin on the hotel rug</p>
<p>Well hammer man he stood stone still<br />
He grabbed his hammer and prepared to kill<br />
The blood in his eyes began to fill<br />
He said “I’m gonna kill you boys, and kill you I will”<br />
Well he threw his hammer across the room<br />
And he knocked one cop square in the face</p>
<p>Bam Bam Bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am<br />
Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am yes I am</p>
<p>Then the hammer came whirllin about<br />
Caught the other cop right in the mouth<br />
Both cops bleedin on the dirty floor<br />
And that poor ol cow well he don’t move no more<br />
The hammer man knew just what to do<br />
And he had himself a fine bar-b-q</p>
<p>Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am yes I am<br />
Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am yes I am<br />
Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am yes I am<br />
Bam bam bam I’m a hammer man<br />
A hammer man yes I am</p>

Someone has come down from the trail<br />
Flying a kite, like a whale it has a long tail<br />
Life was never this good<br />
Every new day is wanted<br />
I am a kite on a string and<br />
I&#8217;m feeling the sting of heaven</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a crack in the dam<br />
It&#8217;s leaking the water that feeds us<br />
and I&#8217;m thirsty, but I&#8217;m ready to hope<br />
Nobody&#8217;s heart gonna get broken<br />
Life was never this good<br />
Every new day is wanted<br />
I am a dammed up stream<br />
I&#8217;m a broken dream of ocean</p>
<p>La la la la la<br />
La la la la la</p>

Where I can live</p>
<p>But I hear<br />
Broken voices<br />
Singing songs<br />
All night long</p>
<p>Would you take my reaching arms<br />
Would you pull me out by the hand<br />
From the depths that I have swam<br />
And put me back unto the beach sand again</p>
<p>At the edge of the world<br />
Could you hear my screaming voice<br />
Can&#8217;t you see that I had no choice<br />
I&#8217;m going over&#8230;</p>
<p>The edge of the world x4</p>

Through the badlands</p>

I don&#8217;t eat spicey food<br />
I don&#8217;t use course language around little girls<br />
Go to Church every Sunday<br />
I shake the pastor&#8217;s hand<br />
and he smiles down upon me<br />
cause i&#8217;m a god fearing man</p>
<p>My whole life<br />
i&#8217;ve never done wrong<br />
then you came along<br />
and you turned me on</p>
<p>Heaven Help Me<br />
I&#8217;m going wrong<br />
You turn me on<br />
you turn me on</p>
<p>Heaven Help Me<br />
I&#8217;m going Wrong<br />
You turn me on<br />
You turn me on</p>
<p>these thoughts in my head<br />
i could never explain<br />
they make my cheeks turn red<br />
yes they make me so ashamed</p>
<p>but oh the way she moves<br />
makes my heart dance<br />
with every stare she proves<br />
how i never had a chance</p>
<p>Heaven Help Me<br />
I&#8217;m going Wrong<br />
You turn me on<br />
You turn me on</p>
<p>Heaven Help Me<br />
I&#8217;m going Wrong<br />
You turn me on<br />
You turn me on</p>
<p>Now I can feel her power<br />
Its increasing with the hour<br />
i am devoured by her<br />
Yet i feel no fear</p>
<p>But come judgement day<br />
i know just what i&#8217;m gonna say<br />
god made a woman<br />
god made a man<br />
told them to be fruitful<br />
to fill the lands</p>
<p>Heaven Help Me<br />
I&#8217;m going Wrong<br />
You turn me on<br />
You turn me on</p>
<p>Heaven Help Me<br />
I&#8217;m going Wrong<br />
You turn me on<br />
You turn me on</p>
<p>You turn me on<br />
You turn me on</p>

Don’t wanna feel like I’ve used them<br />
I know I surely would<br />
I surely would</p>
<p>Come together in the mountains<br />
And meet me at the sea<br />
Driving westward on Tuesday<br />
Skating on ice patches in the dark<br />
In the dark<br />
In the dark<br />
In the dark</p>
<p>Fly me over to your place<br />
After the show is done<br />
Got some beer<br />
Right here<br />
In my suitcase<br />
Have you got the smoke<br />
To fill my lungs?<br />
Got three dollars in my pocket<br />
Just enough to see me through<br />
‘Til I get back to my girl<br />
Where the love keeps shining through<br />
Shining through</p>
<p>Come together in the mountains<br />
And meet me at the sea<br />
Riding westward on Tuesday<br />
Skating on ice patches in the dark<br />
In the dark (x 13)</p>

The world is round<br />
For our devices<br />
We will need a flat playing ground</p>
<p>Please forget<br />
The rules of the game<br />
I only hope that you recall<br />
The sound of my name</p>
<p>It’s so simple<br />
It’s extraordinary<br />
You’re a painted tiger<br />
I’m a caged canary</p>
<p>You were bold<br />
And I was shy<br />
But I could tell what you were thinking<br />
By the color of your eyes<br />
But there’s been a transformation<br />
Of the strangest kind<br />
I put on your glasses<br />
Took ‘em off and now I’m blind</p>
<p>It’s so simple<br />
It’s extraordinary<br />
You’re a painted tiger<br />
I’m a caged canary</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s late<br />
But I don’t care<br />
Just don’t let me go disappearing<br />
Into thin air<br />
I guess tomorrow’s coming<br />
Midnight bells do chime<br />
Wasn’t too exciting<br />
But I had a good time</p>
<p>Hope you don’t remember<br />
The other names you’ve had<br />
For better or for worse<br />
In good times and in bad<br />
‘Cause none of that matters<br />
Now that we are alone<br />
I’ll call you what I want to<br />
And for now I’ll call you home</p>
<p>It’s so simple<br />
It’s extraordinary<br />
You’re a painted tiger<br />
I’m a caged canary</p>
<p>My home<br />
Feels right</p>

And a trailer to haul<br />
And a heart that can only be true”<br />

All for the love of you</p>
<p>I could have been<br />
A company man<br />
Watched the work get done<br />
I could have even been the president<br />
After her daddy passed on</p>
<p>But I’ve got a truck with a trailer to haul<br />
And a heart that can only be true<br />
I scorned the heart of a rich man’s daughter<br />
All for the love of you</p>
<p>Come away with me<br />
I’ve got all that we need<br />
If the highway is my kingdom you can be my queen<br />
But we really gotta hurry<br />
I owe that rich girl some money<br />
And I hear her daddy’s looking for me -<br />
but it&#8217;s not my child!</p>

And a heart that can only be true<br />

All for the love of you</p>
