         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>We can safely say that 15-year-old Lucas Cruikshank, creator of the wildly popular Fred character on YouTube, is the youngest innovator that Giga Omni Media has had on its stage. Cruikshank, who has a Mac laptop and a blackberry, says one secret is to launch videos on Thursday around the time that kids get out of school. The buzz will pick up on Friday during school hours and on Saturday the show will often get the most views.</p> <p><iframe class="embeddedvideo" width="400" height="320" src="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/862265" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"/><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ustream.tv/" style="padding:2px 0px 4px;width:400px;background:#FFFFFF;display:block;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;font-size:10px;text-decoration:underline;text-align:center;">Live Videos by Ustream</a></p> <p>Cruikshank says the hyperactive, weird Fred character is an exaggerated version of his younger brothers and a good perk of being a 15-year-old online video star is that seniors at his high school will talk to him despite the fact that he&#8217;s a freshman. Want to know what kind of a CPM he charges? Well, he&#8217;s not going to tell you.</p>

<p>The switch has just received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, so Siemens is cleared to begin using it as soon as the system is in place. FDA 510(k) clearance is a series of requirements any new medial devices must meet, by law, before they can be implemented in practice. The clearance opens the door for other health science and service companies to make similar use of the Apple operating system.</p>
<p>Siemens lists increased patient data storage capacity, expandable patient data management capabilities, faster sequencing times and more customizable reporting functions as the reasons for the selection of OS X.<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/13/os-x-to-help-fight-hiv/#more-10248" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

Om kicks it off with a question about where we are now with online video in the living room.</p> <p><strong>Blake: </strong>This is a glacial sort of process with some quick polar ice caps melting every now and then. It&#8217;s not guys who are proceeding with the technological building block, but the guys building the enabling solutions. The technological building blocks are all there, but you have these business model challenges that will continue to hold the industry back.</p> <p>We all like to talk about if it will be online video or the cable TV and Internet. It&#8217;s not &#8216;or,&#8217; it&#8217;s an &#8216;and.&#8217; The bigger challenge is, When we have more and more choice, how do we make that access ubiquitous — regardless of the type of display and location of that content? Then, how do you help consumers find what they&#8217;re looking for. There&#8217;s less choice on the PC than on the cable boxes, but it&#8217;s easier to find what you&#8217;re looking for so it feels like there are more.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>So should we expect to see a web-like experience on the TV?</p> <p><strong>Blake: </strong>The experiences and the tools that are part of the web that we take for granted, such as sending a link or search, will unlock a tremendous amount of value.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>Google and Apple do search and experience really well, so will they come into the living room?</p> <p><strong>Blake:</strong> It&#8217;s the cable and satellite guys. This is there business to lose if they continue to stay asleep at the wheel. They&#8217;re differentiation today is I have more HD channels than everyone else. They&#8217;re not thinking about the experience.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>What are you guys doing at Sling now?</p> <p><strong>Blake:</strong> We&#8217;re entering phase two of the company now. Our view in life is, there are many different displays, locations and sources of content, and our goal is to make it so seamless that the consumer doesn&#8217;t have to care. We are launching a video destination site on (I think) the 24th of this month. One of the big shifts in that site is that it&#8217;s the first multi-source multi-platform on that site. We&#8217;ll have web content, but if you have a Slingbox you can go from the web to watching live TV from the Slingbox. Then we&#8217;ll bring those web tools to the traditional TV screens.</p> <p><strong>Om:</strong> The next big thing is TiVo with anytime TV, and Slingbox came along with anytime TV — and now we&#8217;re talking about TV that&#8217;s managed through a computer device?</p> <p><strong>Blake: </strong>Yes, if you stop and look, it was technically possible, but it&#8217;s pathetic that we haven&#8217;t delivered it. Look at NBC on the Olympics on the web and on TV. Why can&#8217;t this shit be synchronized? Why isn&#8217;t that tied together? It&#8217;s possible. It&#8217;s because we couldn&#8217;t get into the cable boxes. And that&#8217;s changing now. There are services we&#8217;re working on to make media richer and also create a bigger ad inventory. Fundamentally this is possible, but no one knows if they have the rights to this? Working through those rights to the content will be difficult and make it a glacial process.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>Why are you so optimistic about home video in our homes when Steve Jobs says Apple TV is just a hobby?</p> <p><strong>Blake:</strong> If you&#8217;re doing well, it&#8217;s the second coming, then if you&#8217;re not doing well, that&#8217;s a hobby.</p>

When deploying an in-depth technology protocol, such as WiAMX and LTE, many firms will own the intellectual property needed to create a network, from the silicon to the handsets.

ADC adds another player to that mix. Because ADC doesn't make hardware such as handsets, it doesn't have an incentive to trade its patents for the use of other patents needed for an LTE device to work. It also isn't a member of a standards organization, which WOULD limit the royalties ADC could charge. We'll see if the industry players attempt to deal with ADC or move straight to litigation. The results could mean pricier LTE handsets or even the halt of LTE- and WiMAX-enabled devices, should litigation go poorly.</description>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>In addition to receiving an infusion of cash through its merger with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.winrock.org/">Winrock International</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ert.net/">Environmental Resources Trust’s</a> Greenhouse Gas Registry also got a name change: It is now the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.americancarbonregistry.org/">American Carbon Registry</a>. But the folks with the money at Winrock are doing more than just thinking about what the world’s first carbon registry should be called; they have helped the registry compile the detailed new guidance documents <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-13-2008/0004924445&amp;EDATE=">it’s rolling out today</a>.</p> <p>According to American Carbon Registry Founder and Nobel Prize winner Wiley Barbour, the hope is that this will position the registry for success when the federal government institutes national cap-and-trade legislation for carbon. Barbour says private registries with a history of quality offsets and a transparent registration process based on solid guidelines may be able to get offsets through the federal compliance process more quickly. A federal system could create a huge market — in the range of hundreds of millions — for quality offsets, according to Barbour.</p> <p>In the meantime, registries are contending with state and voluntary markets. Barbour notes that state carbon initiatives could follow in the footsteps of other pollution policies and spur both the federal government and private companies to embrace a federal cap-and trade policy. But he also sees the voluntary market as part of what is lowering the bar in the carbon world. “When you look at the voluntary market, the majority of what trades or sells as offsets is, in my mind, at the low-end of the quality scale,” Barbour says. “It hasn’t been third-party verified, its ownership is not clear, and it’s not registered.”</p> <p>For that reason, Barbour says he welcomes the “gold rush”-like surge in private registries, many of which have joined American Carbon Registry in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.offsetqualityinitiative.org/">Quality Carbon Offset Initiative</a>, a nonprofit partnership lobbying for effective greenhouse gas policy.

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>It&#8217;s all about &#8220;transmedia&#8221; &#8212; the convergence of media and the spread of content across platforms &#8212; says the panel of experts made up by Jesse Alexander, Writer and Producer, <em>Heroes</em>; Bill Gannon, Director of Online Operations, Lucasfilm; Jeff Gomez, CEO Starlight Runner Entertainment; and Greg Goodfried, Co-Founder, President and COO, EQAL. The metrics are experimental right now, though if companies are buying ads it&#8217;s a good sign, says the panel. But be careful &#8212; it can all go horribly wrong! And remember the geeks that consume your digital transmedia bits are powerful and will be the torch bearers of your brands.</p> <p><strong>How Important Is Transmedia?:</strong> Lucasfilm&#8217;s Gannon says the key to managing transmedia well is to have everyone on staff think the same way. Lucasfilm has a phenomenal licensing division that explores the transmedia universe, he says. <em>Heroes&#8217;</em> Alexander warns that care needs to be taken in order to avoid missteps. EQAL&#8217;s Goodfried&#8217;s agrees and says you need to establish trust with the user, by using open dialogue and communication. Starlight Runner&#8217;s Gomez says the trend of converging media brought the new president into the White House and it will do the same with online video. Our own Chris calls it the equivalent of unicorns and puppy dogs!</p> <p><strong>The Metrics of Transmedia:</strong> Alexander says Hollywood isn&#8217;t necessarily designed to show a profit. It doesn&#8217;t have a clear metric for success, he says. On the web it&#8217;s easy to track how successful something is. At <em>Heroes</em>, he says, they do well with online content, but, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to see what metric we come up with to measure success.&#8221; Alexander says one metric is: Are advertisers buying into this? Advertisers are coming to NBC and requesting a massive stake in digital space, he says. But ultimately the groups (studios) are not designed to play well together, he says.</p> <p><strong>How to Make Transmedia Work?:</strong> Gomez says have visionary execs there to point out the strengths and weaknesses of which media platform is best for certain aspects of your content. Alexander says (half-jokingly) that everything he&#8217;s done successfully he&#8217;s ripped off from <em>Star Wars</em>. It also has to be organic and compartmentalized &#8212; be very careful of forcing the audience to consume all parts of the media experience to understand the story, says Alexander. Goodfried says there needs to be a value-add for their time spent for every bit of content delivered.</p> <p>Gomez says that while what they do might be seen as enormously geeky, the people who care the most are the torch bearers and will speak on behalf of your intellectual property. That kid in the living room who points to the show and talks about it &#8212; that kid has power; he is the gatekeeper of information. That is the most important aspect of transmedia and will make your content evergreen. Alexander reminds us that transmedia is not just for geeks, it&#8217;s for mainstream audiences, too.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Within the year, cable companies are going to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/09/09/in-online-privacy-fight-google-blinks/">invade your privacy Google style</a>. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-canoe-ventures-project-unveiled-aegis-verklin-to-head-comcast-led-ad-ta/">Canoe Ventures outlined its strategy</a> today at the NewTeeVee Live conference in San Francisco, where David Verklin, the CEO, outlined the cable industry&#8217;s answer to the competition from online video. The vision wraps compelling features for consumers around a hidden advertising and data gathering agenda. Within 100 days, better targeted advertising will be rolled out in some markets, and within the year consumers will see new features.</p> <p>Canoe Ventures is a joint venture between the top six cable providers and Verklin took to the stage to tell us cable&#8217;s vision of television as a platform. &#8220;I came 3,000 miles to deliver one simple message. Don&#8217;t count out the television business,&#8221; Verklin said.</p> <p>He pointed out that cable companies are in 70 million of the 101 million video-subscribing households. Canoe represents about 60 million of those households and is the Internet service provider for 35 percent of the country. Verklin says the cable guys invested in Canoe because the video content creation and consumption business is changing right before the industry&#8217;s eyes.</p> <p>To answer this change, Canoe wants to bring more features to television from your remote control, focused on interactivity and addressablity. Verklin says, this isn&#8217;t just about the ads but about the programming. For example, he said, Canoe is going to add voting and polling where consumers can vote on their favorite player during a football game or on American Idol. Cable also wants to add a feature called request for information, that allows you to watch <em>Emeril Live</em> and click a button to get a recipe via email or text or perhaps get a catalogue via mail after seeing it on TV.</p> <p>The third product is &#8220;t-commerce,&#8221; where you can buy from the television and be charged on your cable bill or credit card. It&#8217;s easier than phone calls or filling out forms online, according to Verklin. Fourth is telescoping, where you can click through on a movie and and see a whole trailer, or click through on a video game ad and see a demo. The final product is addressibility — ads targeted to you. No more dog food ads if you don&#8217;t own a dog. But a question consumers need to ask is, &#8220;Do I really want my cable company knowing that much about me?<em>&#8221;
</em></p> <p>&#8220;Data is the new creative,&#8221; Verklin said. He said Canoe thinks the key to that data is the set-top box that&#8217;s already hooked up to the televison. That box can tell advertisers exactly how many people are watching an ad. But Verlkin says they&#8217;ll keep personally identifiable information anonymous (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-10094798-71.html">just like Google</a>.) &#8220;We can bring at last one of the interactive applications to 15 to 20 million households by this time next year,&#8221; Verklin says. He added that the cable guys are working on limited network addressiblity within the next 100 days. That&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/08/25/your-cable-box-knows-you-so-well/">our countdown to privacy loss</a>.</p>

I didn't expect to see the Dell Insipiron Mini 12 in the U.S. so soon, but of course, the holidays are a-coming. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/08/11/13/dell.inspiron.mini.12.us/">Electronista</a> says that you can order the new small notebook from Dell and sure enough, the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-12?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">product order is page is live</a>. Although we originally heard that only a 24 W/hr 3-cell battery would be available, I see that two of the three models come with a 48 W/hr 6-cell battery. Based on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://apcmag.com/scoop_we_review_the_inspiron_mini_12__dells_supersized_yet_superslim_12_inch_netbook.htm">APC review with the 3-cell</a>, I suspect that 5.5-hours of real-world time can be had with the 6-cell unit. Here's the breakdown of models and pricing; note that all models are the same externally with the 12.1-inch, 1280x800 display and all come with Windows Vista Home Basic SP1, 1GB of RAM and integrated 802.11g WiFi:</p> <ul><li>$549 = 1.33GHz Intel Atom Z520 CPU, 40GB hard-drive (4200 RPM)</li> <li>$599 = 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z530 CPU, 60GB hard-drive (4200 RPM). Price reflects a $55 instant savings.</li> <li>$649 = 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z530 CPU, 80GB hard-drive (4200 RPM). Price reflects an $80 instant savings.</li></ul> <p>Couple of thoughts here. At this price range, you <strong>could</strong> buy a low-end notebook with more under the hood for the same price. Of course, those would likely weigh more, be thicker and not run as long on a single charge. I realize that the Silverthorne version of Atom that Dell went with uses slightly less power than the Diamondville version, but part of me wishes that they went Diamondville. Why? Systems using the Z520 or Z530 max out at 1GB of RAM. Not a deal-breaker if you intend to use the Mini 12 as a netbook for web and mail, but for some, this will be a disappointment. The benefit however is a deeper power down state (C6) and the pairing of the Poulsbo chipset, which should yield benefits in the graphic department as support matures.</p> <p>Dell will sell you an external USB optical drive for $85 and you can opt for an Alpine White device over Obsidian Black at no extra charge. Going with either of the two higher priced models, you can drop the 6-cell battery in favor of the 3-cell, but that only knocks $30 off the price. Likewise, you can go with a 6-cell on the low-end model and add $30. Nice to see that the price is the same whether you're coming or going. For $30, I'd lean heavily towards the higher capacity unit (below), even if it does extend out the back.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/11/13/mini12_battery.jpg"><img width="314" height="314" border="0" alt="Mini12_battery" title="Mini12_battery" src="http://www.jkontherun.com/images/2008/11/13/mini12_battery.jpg"/></a>

<p class="excerpt">In recent years, the Mac has become a device capable of acting as a very powerful media center. iTunes, Front Row, and OS X in general, provide a plethora of features which justify the Mac as a living room device.</p>
<p>That said, one vital piece is missing as a standard: watching and recording live TV on your Mac. There is a wide variety of hardware and software which allow you to watch TV, and this post will cover some of the options available to you.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s available?</h3>
<p>There are several different TV receivers available for the Mac. They all connect via USB, plug into an antenna socket (some include small, portable antennas), and are bundled with a piece of software. Many offer slightly different additional features which meet the specific needs of different users.</p>
<p>The most widely known company producing Mac tuners is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products.en.html">Elgato</a>. They develop a range of &#8216;EyeTV&#8217; devices, and also the widely acclaimed <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/software/EyeTV3/product1.en.html">EyeTV Software</a>. The main competitors to Elgato consist of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Mac+Solutions/Mac/">Pinnacle</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miglia.com/products/tv.php">Miglia</a>. Interestingly, the majority of TV products are aimed at the non-U.S. international market. I&#8217;ll note which devices are international and which are U.S. compatible below.<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/13/tv-adapters-for-mac-9-options-for-watching-live-television/#more-10406" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

This company has a shrewd approach toward the growing open source arena, participating in growth as many disparate kinds of projects are adopted, and the need for open source auditing rises. Here's what they've done right, and why more success may lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mike noted all the way &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ostatic.com/160456-blog/black-duck-buys-koders"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt;, Black Duck bought the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.koders.com/"&gt;Koders&lt;/a&gt; search engine, which contains over 1 billion lines of open source code, and is used by thousands of developers each day. It's also increasingly used by organizations that need to manage their software assets and licensing obligations, and used within Black Duck's software tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Duck's core business is delivering products that can go through an entire code base, even enterprise level ones, reporting on open source components that are present, and the licensing obligations that pertain to them. (It also helps companies find, approve, and manage open source solutions.) Koders, a top tool for doing this kind of scouring and reporting, was a shrewd acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Black Duck's &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackducksoftware.com/news/releases/2008-10-28"&gt;rosy business report&lt;/a&gt; stresses, the company's mergers &amp;amp; acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A) business grew over 150 percent year-over-year in the third quarter--a miserable quarter for countless companies. The searching and reporting for open source components and code within large code bases that Black Duck does is an essential part of the due diligence process that goes on when one company wants to acquire another. Among many reasons for this, the licensing obligations, or freedom for them, that particular types of open source implementations have can have a profound impact on the valuation of technology assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to note here is how Black Duck has carved out a lucrative spot for itself sitting on top of the open source mountaintop. As M&amp;amp;A activity increases over time--and it may do so dramatically during the economic downturn--Black Duck benefits regardless of the fate of this or that particular open source project. It was early to lock up essential tools to differentiate itself at doing this, such as the Koders search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of the fact that, as Burton Malkiel established in his book &lt;em&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, over 80 percent of mutual fund managers lose to index funds--where investors are just buying the market, rather than anyone making individual stock picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Duck has taken a very interesting approach to indexing the growth of open source. As aggregate open source deployments and needs for audits grow over time, so does Black Duck, even in a terrible economy. Sometimes focusing on the haystack beats focusing on the needle. &lt;/p&gt;

<strong>Eric Schmidt</strong>, who runs Microsoft Silverlight&#8217;s monetization and adoption efforts
<strong>Mark Taylor</strong>, SVP, Level 3 Communications
<strong>Alex Withers</strong>, Director of Digital Media for USGA</p> <p><strong>Om:</strong> Live video is exploding on the web so let&#8217;s talk about the business and economics of live video. The cable and telephone companies like to talk about live video breaking the Internet. But today, do you think Oprah can bring the network down?</p> <p><strong>Morgan: </strong>In the old days it might have, but with new CDNs the capacity to scale the business and grow the business is growing exponentially.</p> <p><strong>Mark:</strong> there&#8217;s no technical reason the Internet should break. There are technical glitches, but there&#8217;s no reason the traffic can&#8217;t be carried. However, we need to find ways to encourage people to invest in order to carry that traffic. There may be disincentives to invest for some of those carriers.</p> <p><strong>Schmidt: </strong>With the Olympics we wanted to consume the bandwidth out there, so we provided the ability to throttle up and throttle down automatically at the consumer level to help save bandwidth.</p> <p><strong>Om:</strong> The incremental cost of a viewer is zero on the broadcast world, but the gain is high. On the web side, the incremental cost of a viewer is high and the gain seems to be less. When do you guys start to make money?</p> <p><strong>Morgan: </strong>The quality is there and the costs are moving way down, but the real issue is the ad model. Not going to talk about the costs.</p> <p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> We can deliver the right CPM to cover the costs of delivering the content if you have good contnt and providing the right user experience around that content.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>What the cost per person to deliver live events and are people making money</p> <p><strong>Mark:</strong> People are making money. The cost of delivery of the distribution is a tiny cost that can be covered by subscription models or ad models. Broadcast may be free, but the upfront costs can be much less. Your cost-based grows as your audience grows.</p> <p><strong>Withers: </strong>There&#8217;s a huge difference in repurposing a broadcast, but if you can add cameras and send additional content, it&#8217;s more popular and you have the chance to make money on it?</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>So how much can you spend and how much do make from these types of events.</p> <p><strong>Withers:</strong> On repurposed streams you&#8217;re able to make money, but on live online steaming that you produce you can gain the audience but maybe not make money.</p> <p><strong>Morgan:</strong> We will get better than broadcast CPMs, because we can do better targeting more features and better. This is for repurposed content.</p> <p><strong>Mark:</strong> But even with parity, you&#8217;re not going to get to Lost produced and shown only online.</p> <p><strong>Withers:</strong> The trends to move to monetitzation makes this a tough media market and we&#8217;re going to have to find ways to gain revenue beyond subscriptions.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>Will the slowdown slow down the deployment of live video?</p> <p><strong>Schmidt: </strong>We&#8217;re actually finding more people interested in it right now. Ad sales and campaign managers are starting to have better conversations with people to sell ads around these events.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>You&#8217;re promising live video on the web, how do bandwidth caps and limitations affecting the deployment of live video.</p> <p><strong>Morgan: </strong>Right now, that&#8217;s not a problem but eventually as more people turn to the web for TV it could be, but I think the carriers will adapt.</p> <p><strong>Mark: </strong>We&#8217;re paid to move the bits that we carry and the last mile guys are trying to do that in many ways. We need to realign the incentives in the whole distribution chain, but tat move isn&#8217;t going to be popular and if that move doesn&#8217;t choke off demand.</p> <p><strong>Schmidt: </strong>ISPs are still trying to understand the model they need in order to attract the audiences today who want non-linear content. It&#8217;s unfortunate that the set-top box market in the U.S. is like it it is today because it&#8217;s stifling innovation.</p> <p><strong>Withers: </strong>The cable carriers and the content creators are going to have to adjust our deals to adjust to this delivery mechanism. When web TV is comparable to television that is when I think they&#8217;ll flip that switch.</p> <p><strong>Morgan: </strong>We&#8217;re spending the most time on business issues, trying to figure out what the best business practice is. We just need to be good at providing high-quality programming into the consumers.</p> <p><strong>Withers: </strong>We also need to get a good advertising model that works well and supports this model as well.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>What kind of content will be a hit?</p> <p><strong>Morgan: </strong>Not sure if it&#8217;s a replacement or if its things I can&#8217;t get elsewhere. In three years time I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s going to be a distinction between TV and web.</p> <p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a version of the long tail. There&#8217;s a massive amount of content out there in vaults that people could want to watch. The demand is there the disk space is there the quality of the client, and PCs are strong enough. I also think we&#8217;ll see more broadcasts of content that isn&#8217;t currently delivered.</p> <p><strong>Mark:</strong> On the live front, sports will lead the way, and I want to see more cross border sports. You could also open up events, such as broadcast concerts online. Will likely see more events online even for ever smaller audience.</p> <p><strong>Om: </strong>Large volume or satisfy the niche audience?</p> <p><strong>Withers: </strong>The ROI on the live broadcast for a limited audience may not work, but focusing on more compelling content. You also need to think about what should be live, and what should be on-demand. When we showed Tiger Woods interviews live no one watched them. they wanted them on-demand, but they wanted to see him play live.</p>

A <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/19185/SKMNEGrid">new study</a> from Scotland looks at the possibility of a supergrid between Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, but doesn&#8217;t mention Scotland&#8217;s big neighbor to the south.</p> <p>Yes, Scotland is still part of the UK, and most of England&#8217;s east coast is also on the North Sea, but the word &#8220;England&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even show up once in the 21-page study and &#8220;UK&#8221; is only used in a couple of footnotes. It might just be an oversight, but the possible snub comes during the same week in which the UK government made a filing with the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.commissiononscottishdevolution.org.uk/">Commission on Scottish Devolution</a> questioning the Scottish government&#8217;s powers covering energy.</p> <p>Political wrangling aside, there&#8217;s a big push for wind and marine power in the UK, not just in Scotland, so the area could become a hub for renewable energy in the region. In October, the UK government said it <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/10/21/the-daily-sprout-pge-daimlers-smart-uks-got-wind/">surpassed Denmark</a> to take the top spot in offshore wind power in the world, boasting 590 megawatts of offshore wind vs. Denmark&#8217;s 423 megawatts.</p> <p>Sweden&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vattenfall.com/">Vattenfall</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://earth2tech.com/2008/11/10/vattenfall-barrels-into-uk-wind-past-big-oil/">just announced plans</a> to invest in wind power in the UK, teaming up with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scottishpowerrenewables.com/">ScottishPower Renewables</a> to make joint bids on offshore wind development, including areas in the North Sea. The two plan to build 6,000 megawatts of installed wind power capacity.</p> <p>ScottishPower, part of Spain&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.iberdrola.es/wcorp/corporativa/iberdrola?cambioIdioma=ESINICIO">Iberdrola</a>, is also looking at marine power, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scottishpower.com/PressReleases_1764.htm">releasing plans</a> in September to build up to 60 megawatts of tidal power capacity in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/">Crown Estate</a>, which owns the seabed around the country, recently opened up the Pentland Firth off of northern Scotland for commercial wave and tidal projects, aiming to generate more than 700 MW of power by 2020.</p> <p>There are already big projects going on in England and if there was Scottish-only supergrid, it would lose out on connecting to the planned 1-gigawatt <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.londonarray.com/">London Array</a> offshore wind farm as well as the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wavehub.co.uk/">Wave Hub</a> project.</p> <p>A recent plan from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace</a> for a €20 billion ($25.032 billion) renewable energy grid in the area was <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/04/windpower.renewableenergy">much more inclusive</a>, with both England and Scotland making the list, as well as France. However, the environmental group did neglect Sweden, which only has access to the North Sea through the Skagerrak strait.</p> <p>The Scottish government is still working on its plans for a North Sea supergrid and estimated that it would need £409,200 ($606,475) and about 17 months to do a full study on the project.</p>

I attended an online press briefing this morning where senior management of AMD outlined their strategy going forward.&nbsp; Mobile nut that I am I was especially looking for news about their mobile computing intentions and in spite of stating in the past that they had no aims on the netbook market they do indeed plan to enter it.&nbsp; Their netbook processing chipset, code-named Yukon, will be introduced in the first half of 2009.&nbsp; What is a bit confusing is that the power footprint they quoted for the Yukon is 25 W TDP.&nbsp; When you consider that the competing Intel Atom has a 2.5 W TDP you wonder how this will work exactly.&nbsp; The Yukon offering combines both the CPU and the graphics and that contributes to the high power requirements but even if you combine the Atom requirements with that of Intel's 945 chipset you only get 8.5 W.&nbsp; Expect more information as it becomes available down the road.</p><div class="feedflare">

I'm working away in the local coffee bar and see something that I've been seeing more and more of lately and it puzzles me.&nbsp; A couple of people was working away at the tables and got up to leave to resume their work day.&nbsp; They each picked up their notebook with the papers they were carrying and headed out the door.&nbsp; Both of them were carrying their notebook naked, no case, sleeve, nothing.&nbsp; I am seeing this done more frequently the past couple of weeks than I have ever seen and I'm wondering why anyone would carry a notebook, especially a full-size one, around unprotective?&nbsp; It's not safe, it's not comfortable and if it happened to start raining while they were in the coffee shop they'd be toast.&nbsp; Am I missing something?</p><div class="feedflare">

I just got back from an hour of offline time helping out at the local food bank and look what was waiting for me at home? Say hello to the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phone on loan through the Nokia Blogger Relations program. Actually, should we refer to the 5800 as the Tube? Ah, whatever you call it, I'm looking forward to using a Symbian S60 device with a full touchscreen. Actually, I'd <strong>better</strong> be since the 5800 only <strong>has</strong> a touchscreen for input!</p> <p>Although the original thought was that such a device would compete with the popular iPhone, I reset my expectations <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1256590">as soon as the device was officially unveiled last month</a>. Nokia is targeting this more to the "I want a phone that's geared for audio &amp; video with a little bit of web and some social aspect" crowd. That became obvious when I saw the one-touch Media Bar for quick access to tunes, images, video, sharing and web. Plus the word "Music" is in the name... that kinda gives things away, no? Oh, and there's that little stand so you can prop the device up in landscape mode for watching vids.</p> <p>It also doesn't hurt that the the 5800 pairs a 3.2-megapixel camera sensor with Carl Zeiss optics and autofocus. You can record VGA (640x480 video) at 30fps with the XpressMusic. I'm not yet sold on the fact that the device has a stylus, so I'll be watching how often I reach for it... hopefully, not much. I'm already liking the haptic feedback on the screen and I'll have to see if the "Comes With Music"... uh... came with it. ;)</p><div class="feedflare">

It&#8217;s a big deal. It was a fraction of that 6 months ago. Think of it like what Starbucks did for premium coffee, is like what we&#8217;re doing for the premium content business &#8212; if you can make it easier to consume, people will consume more. Media is an impulse business. A lot of this is from infrastructure that is far beyond Hulu.</p> <p><strong>Obsessing:</strong> Our mission is ambitious and never ending. Our goal is to deliver a service that users, advertisers, and content owners unabashedly love. Our strategy is to deliver &#8220;brain-spray&#8221; awesome quality. The implementation is similar to when I worked at Disney. Attention to detail is the cornerstone of how Hulu has designed its service &#8212; we obsess over each pixel on the screen. The team at Hulu are odd birds. We argue over fonts, design, and we obsess over everything.</p> <p>Give users and advertisers choice. Listen to users &#8212; empower them. Relentlessly innovate. The product is a function of being neurotic, but its good for users. Listen and take action quickly.</p> <p><strong>Results of Hulu:</strong> In the 8 months since launch, we&#8217;ve had 12 million monthly users, and 145 million monthly video streams. PC World Magazine named Hulu No. 1 product of 2008, and TIME Magazine rated Hulu among the Top 5 inventions of 2008. Hulu has been embedded over 1.5 million times, and on over 60,000 sites. We&#8217;ve attracted 115 top content owners, including Warner Bros, Sony, MGM, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, Paramount, and NHL.</p>

That doesn&#8217;t sound terribly expensive, but for users who were planning to use it for data extensive applications and desire unlimited data, they will supposedly be told to &#8220;get a wireless PC card.&#8221; However, oddly, while BlackBerry customers can pay for additional data at more costly $.48/MB, iPhone users will purportedly have their service &#8220;automatically disconnected&#8221; if they &#8220;use too much bandwidth.&#8221;<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/13/official-iphone-tethering-rumored-to-cost-30month/#more-10431" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>I mentioned <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/04/25/low-tech-pleasure-and-pain/">a while ago</a> that I was still carrying around an address book in my purse, and begged for suggestions for managing my contacts because things were getting totally out of hand. It&#8217;s been seven months since I wrote that post, and the situation has not improved! So I was excited to read the recent reviews of a couple of contact management apps by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/28/soocial-the-best-address-book-youll-ever-use/#more-3867">Imran Ali</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/29/contacthero-vying-for-contact-management-dominance/">Aliza Sherman</a>.</p>
<p>I really like the look and features of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.contacthero.com/welcome">ContactHero</a>. As for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soocial.com/">Soocial</a>, I didn&#8217;t play with it, but might be tempted to use their app for no reason other than the fact that they actually say &#8220;ungimp my contacts&#8221; and have a picture of David Hasselhoff in a Speedo on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soocial.com/web-worker-daily">the WWD invite page</a>, both of which made me laugh and got them points for nerve and verve.</p>
<p>But then I realized why I haven&#8217;t made that leap yet, and why I probably won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m old-fashioned (well, when it comes to certain things, there&#8217;s no maybe about it), but I have to point out what I think is a fatal flaw in web-based contact management apps.</p>
<p>I am perfectly OK with storing information about myself, my projects, whatever, in the cloud. I take responsibility for what I might lose, or what might get into the hands of someone with wicked intent&#8230; I weigh the options and accept the risk. I don&#8217;t put clients&#8217; material up there. It doesn&#8217;t belong to me. And I don&#8217;t feel at all comfortable putting someone else&#8217;s address, birthday, and kids&#8217; names anywhere but on my computer&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, but I just don&#8217;t think I have the right to make that call.</p>
<p>Hate to be a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Downer">Debbie Downer</a>, but has this minor ethical question crossed anyone else&#8217;s mind?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a web worker like the rest of you, and my personal life is as Internet oriented as my professional life, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic or appropriate for us to expect the Internet to be a panacea. It&#8217;s not <em>always </em>the right solution.</p>
<p>So I have gone back to the drawing board and started looking again for a good, old-fashioned address book/contact management app I can download and install on my hard drive. So far, no luck. Of the apps I&#8217;ve looked at, the UIs are horrific and they just aren&#8217;t slick enough. (Note to developers: users are getting pretty demanding these days. We&#8217;re being spoiled by things that look and work beautifully, like iPods and anything Ajax&#8230;)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want a productivity tool, don&#8217;t need a calendar. I&#8217;ve got all that covered. All I want is a way to organize my contacts.</p>
<p><em>Is this too much to ask? </em></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t I have a desktop address book app that will allow me to enter and import data <em>and </em>scan a biz card if I feel like it (with OCR even)? One that will allow me to upload a photo? Schedule birthday and follow-up alerts? And I want it to be clean and pretty. I want dragging and dropping. Must have a &#8220;Notes&#8221; field where I can write <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Ws">the five Ws</a> if necessary.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t want groups or categories, I want <em>tags</em>! Some of my contacts have to do with my translating, some with my tech writing, some with my blogging, some with my project (and within that category there are artists, investors, legal experts, developers, and more&#8230;). Many of my contacts are in one or more of those categories and they&#8217;re francophiles too. Sometimes I just need to reach the francophiles. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.francophilia.com/">I&#8217;m serious</a>.) I <em>need </em>tags. And can I have a widget too? I have a PC, but not for much longer&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Santa Claus</span> ContactHero, please bring me an address book for my laptop. I&#8217;ve been mostly good.</p>

Buckley told the NewTeeVee audience that, while he didn&#8217;t have a high-speed Internet connection and didn&#8217;t watch YouTube only 2 years ago, his competitive nature drove him to move up into the rankings of YouTube&#8217;s online video stars.</p> <p><iframe class="embeddedvideo" width="400" height="320" src="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/861625" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"/><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ustream.tv/" style="padding:2px 0px 4px;width:400px;background:#FFFFFF;display:block;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;font-size:10px;text-decoration:underline;text-align:center;">Stream videos at Ustream</a></p>

         <title>PeaZip: Robust But Easy OSS File Management, Compression and Archiving [OStatic]</title>
         <link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/gigaomnetwork/~3/452022586/peazip-robust-but-easy-oss-file-management-compression-and-archiving</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3211/3027946710_67e95429ca_o.jpg" alt=""/&gt;If you work with lots of files at a time, work with large files frequently, need a simple way to zip and unzip file archives, or just need a good file and archiving management tool when on-the-go, check out &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://peazip.sourceforge.net/"&gt;PeaZip&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very handy open source file and archive manager that works efficiently with almost any file type. It's available for Windows and Linux, and does a number of surprising things, including allowing you to split very large files and later rejoin them, encrypt files, and generate random passwords for files and archives. It's easy enough for novices, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot below, you can get a feel for the toolbar-driven ways that PeaZip makes it easy to extract zip files, and use an "Extract all to..." option to easily create an archive for files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3218/3027112699_c7c31eecd5_o.jpg" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to have the PeaZip application open to get great use out of it, though. Upon installation, you have the option to add PeaZip optionos to the "Send To" option on context menus. In the screenshot below, I right-clicked on a filename in Windows Explorer, and, as you can see, selected the Send To context menu option. On the right, you can see that I have many archiving and zip options available. I can add the file to an archive, zip it, encrypt it, and even split it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/3027112739_34afbc1fba_o.jpg" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PeaZip can handle many archive and compression formats both for both Windows and Linux users, and you can find details on &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://peazip.sourceforge.net/peazip-free-archiver.html"&gt;supported formats here&lt;/a&gt;. in addition to informative screenshots. PeaZip also supports the following types of encryption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7Z, with AES256 encryption;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeARC's ARC, with AES256, Blowfish, Twofish256 and Serpent256 encryption;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PEA, with AES256 authenticated encryption (EAX mode);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP with WinZip's AE encryption, based on AES256.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PeaZip also comes in a portable version, available through the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ostatic.com/158918-blog/put-over-50-choice-oss-apps-in-your-pocket-in-an-hour"&gt;PortableApps.com download&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.download.com/PeaZip-Portable/3000-2250_4-10836532.html?tag=rbxcrdl1"&gt;five-star review of it here&lt;/a&gt;. "Operating PeaZip Portable is as easy as dragging files. Drop a ZIP file on the interface and PeaZip goes into decompression mode. Drop a regular file and it opens the archiving screen," say the editors at CNet's Download.com. It's easy to carry the PeaZip Portable application on a USB thumb drive, where it requires no installation on the computer you're working on, so you can work efficiently with files, large and small, wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only item on my wish list for PeaZip is for it to be extended out to become a full-blown replacement for Windows Explorer's directory-tree and folder approach to file management. I'm not a fan of Windows Explorer, and PeaZip could be easily extended in this direction. Still, this is one of the most useful open source utilities of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

Liz Gannes, Editor, NewTeeVee chats with Alexis Rapo, V-P, Digital Media, Disney-ABC Television Group about how ABC monetizes the content and what it plans to do in online video.</p> <p>Rapo: We have 17 shows now. The strategy for us is to look at how will we grow this business, and how will we build the ad model around that. So far we feel successful at what we are doing. Now we&#8217;re rolling out additional features to make the viewing experience and advertising experiences better.</p> <p>Liz: Why is your player not embeddable and why a walled garden around your content?</p> <p>Rapo: We have an open format and you can get our link and player elsewhere on the Internet. We have seen that in 72 percent of research, our audience is aware you come to network sites for long-form viewing. They know they are watching a show on our air.</p> <p>Liz: Can you tell us about original content?</p> <p>Rapo: We&#8217;ve tried some mixed approaches for short-form and long-form content. We&#8217;ve tried a few formats for original content: We just launched a series of short videos tied to our <em>Ugly Betty</em> show. We got 8.5 million video views on six episodes over seven weeks. We are pretty bullish on building content around our content. We can continue to build show around our brands, and capitalize on the quality of the characters.</p> <p>Liz: No new web shows?</p> <p>Rapo: Never say never and we&#8217;ve tried original and had good numbers, but when we tried Ugly Betty it just blew that out of the water.</p> <p>Liz: Where is the money coming from? Higher CPMs on the web than on TV?</p> <p>Rapo: We have been able to command premium on CPMs both for short and long form content. Advertisers own an entire stream of a long form and there&#8217;s more likely that consumers will buy something seen advertised online and on air.</p> <p>L: Do you think that watching TV through the browser is a mainstream phenomenon?</p> <p>A: We&#8217;re looking at where the ad dollars are going to flow, but so far we see consumers telling us that this is a catch up mechanism. The shift hasn&#8217;t happened but we have to be prepared with models that as that shift happens you aren&#8217;t giving up a premium business to a sub premium business.</p> <p>L: What will we see coming up?</p> <p>A: You&#8217;ll see more innovation around our long form player, and allowing outside developers to work with us. And we&#8217;re still focusing on monetization.</p> <p>Question: Where does the traffic come from and how will you deal with new set-top-boxes such as Roku?</p> <p>A: About 98 percent of our traffic comes from ABC.com in terms of over-the-top boxes, we&#8217;re looking at how we develop a format and work with the multiple boxes out there?</p> <p>L:How much can you affect the creative aspects of a show for online opportunities?</p> <p>A: We collaborate with our existing shows and were focused on using our existing talent and want to play into existing storylines, and I think the proof for us has been the fan response.</p> <p>Question? Can you tell us about the differences in budgets and timing for short form vs. long-form content?</p> <p>A: We have a fully built out HD video team and center, so we can take that onto shows. We shot Ugly Betty for two days and the programs were ready in three weeks. We&#8217;re very efficient or sometimes cheap. We spend under $100,000 to get those types of short-form content developed.</p>

DRSG, founded in 2001, is also just one of several trade groups that are looking to work on policy issues, and provide information about technologies that can make the power grid smarter.

Google&#8217;s background in software development and information technology, and its strong connection to consumers, could enable it to develop technology that could help consumers cut energy consumption.

         <title>Parallels Desktop 4 vs. VMware Fusion 2: The Web Worker Angle [WebWorkerDaily]</title>

         <description>Any freelancer who does computer-related work, whether on or offline, probably understands the value of being able to work in multiple operating systems. That goes double for web workers, who need to know that what they produce behaves no matter who’s looking at it, or what they look at it with. Enter virtualization software. How does the new Parallels fare against VMWare Fusion for Web Workers?</description>

That goes double for web workers, who need to know that what they produce behaves no matter who’s looking at it, or what they look at it with. Enter virtualization software.</p>
<p>I’m a Mac user, but I don’t absolutely despise all other platforms.</p>
<p>Windows, for me, is like that black sheep uncle who can’t seem to do anything right, but who’s also sometimes the most fun member of the family. XP, that is. I’ve tangoed with Vista, but I still prefer XP, and it’s well-suited to use in virtualized machines. A lighter memory footprint, less flair, and more stability make it the perfect companion for either Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion.</p>
<p>If you read my post earlier this week on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/11/vmware-fusion-2-vs-parallels-desktop-4-lets-dance/">TheAppleBlog</a>, you know that my initial verdict sided with Fusion 2 over Parallels 4. Reasons for my decision included ease of use, OS X integration, and video performance.</p>
<p>As a web worker, the criteria for what constitutes good software is different, so I’m going to examine Windows-specific tools, and their performance under both virtualization platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Dependability</strong></p>
<p>If you’re going to be using any app in a virtualized environment, a key consideration is the stability of the program running the guest OS.</p>
<p>In my brief time with the two programs, only Parallels has given me reason to question its reliability. When viewing the exact same content in Internet Explorer in both it and Fusion (running the exact same version of Windows installed from the same source), Parallels’ IE crashed twice while Fusion had no problems. In terms of macro issues, Parallels again loses points, since it was the only of the two to experience a system-wide freeze, which only a hard reset would correct.</p>
<p><strong>Office</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5034" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:617px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/word.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5034" title="word" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/word.png?w=607&#038;h=379" alt="word" width="607" height="379"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fusion on the left, Parallels on the right</p></div>
<p>Say what you like about Microsoft Office, sometimes it’s all clients want to see, even if you advise against it. And yes, OS X has Office 2008, but it still seems to me like they handicapped the program somewhat to push customers in the general direction of Windows and Office 2007. In a head to head performance test, Word 2007 ran superbly in the Parallels virtual machine, showing only infrequent odd visual effects (skips, slight lag) when windows were resized, fullscreened, and moved around in Coherence mode.</p>
<p>A minor point, but for icon snobs, the Word icon in the dock showed less pixilation than that of Word in Fusion. The Fusion installation also displayed more unusual visual effects when resizing and moving the application window. Parallels also gets major points for syncing your documents folder and desktop, meaning that I didn’t have to drag any files to the virtual machine. On the other hand, if you do have to do a file transfer, Parallels is sluggish and sub-par by comparison. For Office virtualization, Parallels takes top honors.</p>
<p><strong>Chrome and IE</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5038" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:617px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/wwd-chrome.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5038" title="wwd-chrome" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/wwd-chrome.png?w=607&#038;h=379" alt="Fusion on the left, Parallels on the right" width="607" height="379"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fusion on the left, Parallels on the right</p></div>
<p>Being able to run Windows-only browsers is key when making sure that webpages display properly in all setups.</p>
<p>Chrome has loads of useful functions for teleworkers, not the least of which is the ability to save sites as Applications. Having access to Web 2.0 apps without browser clutter is not only convenient, it also saves time and money that might otherwise be lost to procrastination. With decent specs and using Unity for Fusion or Coherence for Parallels, you can pretend you already have a fully functional OS X release of Chrome.</p>
<p>In both programs, Chrome runs smoothly, supports fullscreening, and performs snappily. All of the features are there, including tabs running for separate processes, which has saved me a lot of rework when a single instance has failed. Saving a Campfire room and WordPress dashboard as application shortcuts worked fine as well, but here roles were reversed regarding window lag and movement issues, with Fusion delivering the better performance of the two. Parallels does automatically make a shortcut on your OS X desktop, though, which is handy in a pinch. Internet Explorer also performed admirably in both settings, but it should be noted that in my early tests, IE crashed twice while trying to view Quicktime content.</p>
<p><strong>General Issues</strong></p>
<p>Both Fusion and Parallels demonstrated that they still have their fair share of kinks to work out. Parallels, for instance, wouldn’t let me drag windows to my second monitor in Coherence mode, while Fusion had no trouble making the jump. That’s nearly a dealbreaker, since I can see how quickly it would become tiresome to have to switch to windowed mode to move the application between screens whenever you needed to do so. The mirrored folder feature in Parallels is nice, but you can also set it up in Fusion, it’s just not on by default.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>Though both have programs have room for improvement, I have to side with Fusion again in this extended test, since most of the features which it lacks when compared to Parallels can actually be turned on. Plus, dependability and multi-monitor support when in OS integration mode are absolutely crucial in a multi-OS workflow, so it’s hard to side with Parallels until a later build delivers more stability and bug fixes.</p>
<p>You can get <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">Fusion 2</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels Desktop 4</a> now for $79.99 each. Fusion 2 is a free upgrade for users of the original program, while owners of Parallels 3 can upgrade for $39.99.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Well, it&#8217;s official. There really is no pleasing me. One minute I&#8217;m all up in arms because every other web series is playing fast and loose with the product placement. But then, give me a truly enjoyable series that only barely shows its commercial roots, and I&#8217;m all, &#8220;Dude, where&#8217;s the pitch?&#8221; Case in point: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attlostinamerica.com"><em>Lost in America</em></a>, the ambitious travelogue-cum-promotional-series from AT&amp;T, produced for Tremor Media by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dc-partners.net/DCP_Main/">Digital Content Partners</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.studio8.net/">Studio8</a>.</p>
<p>Things start well. I mean, it stars <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tastyblogsnack.com/">iJustine</a>! Seriously, if you wanna land the point that your network keeps people tapped in wherever they go, who better to brand you than one of the web&#8217;s most famous lifecasters? (Sure, she caused a few minor problems for AT&amp;T with that whole <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/wireless/phones/2007-08-14-iphone-bill_N.htm?imw=Y">300-page iPhone bill thing</a>, but hey, bygones.) Doubling your fun is Justine&#8217;s costar, Karen (of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://karenism.com/blog/">Karenism</a>), a blogger extraordinaire in her own right. And the premise is, let&#8217;s drop them off in the middle of nowhere (well, the middle of Anchorage, Alaska; Austin, Texas; and Chicago, Ill. anyway) and give them a series of missions to complete, using only their AT&amp;T phones. Fun!<span id="more-1692"></span></p>
<p>And, slickly directed by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.tubefilter.tv/">Tubefilter&#8217;s</a> Drew Baldwin, it sure <em>looks</em> great. Alaska looks great. Justine and Karen look great. Quality is not remotely an issue here. So why haven&#8217;t I rushed out to switch to AT&amp;T yet?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not Justine and Karen&#8217;s fault. They attack their missions with such adorable zeal that they may soon be replacing buttons as the official worldwide standard of the cutest thing one can be as cute as. And the missions themselves &#8211; uploading photos and video, downloading music, searching the Net &#8211; are certainly a reasonable measure of a phone and a network&#8217;s capability.</p>
<p>But, thing is, I didn&#8217;t really get a feel of why AT&amp;T and the Blackjack 2 were better than anything else they could have been using. Sure, they got great coverage in Alaska, but I had no way of knowing if getting great coverage in Anchorage (a city of 300,000 people) was that big of a deal. (Though getting full bars while on that tiny little plane did seem pretty impressive.)</p>
<p>Also, the web site for the series, with its sporadic Twitter updates and too-thin video blog, really undermines the entire stay-in-touch-while-on-the-go concept. I would have loved to see more blog posts clearly updated mid-mission, or more videos that felt like real behind-the-scenes footage and not just discarded outtakes.</p>
<p>Now, I love the idea of a series that encourages people to step away from the computer without fear of slipping out of touch. And <em>Lost in America</em>, with its two engaging stars having fun adventures in some of America&#8217;s greatest cities, totally did that for me. It just didn&#8217;t convince me I need to take an AT&amp;T phone with me.</p>

The world of video finds itself in a pretty awkward place – watching videos on the web has become as natural as sending email. When recovering from my heart attack, I turned to Hulu to provide on-demand fun. Today, I don’t think twice about spending $20 a month on TV shows from Apple’s iTunes store or $10 for a couple of movies from Jaman. My video-watching habits, while extreme, are precisely what is scaring cable companies into taking &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/09/30/gigaom-white-paper-the-facts-fiction-of-bandwidth-caps/"&gt;the self-destructive and short-sighted approach&lt;/a&gt; of imposing metered broadband on their customers. Phone companies are following suit. Meanwhile, the broader economic downturn and subsequent advertising slowdown is threatening the vibrancy of this business I love so much. Layoffs have started to mar the online studios producing eclectic independent content, and a lack of advertising dollars is poised to plunder the meager treasuries of startups that are finding that the VC spigot has run dry. But just as when you think the (online video) world is coming to an end, you have companies like Netflix, Blockbuster and others introducing devices that marry the web video to the living room experience, and in the process, inventing a whole new dynamic. Today we will hear from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who is going to share his vision of the future, while &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/06/learn-about-the-future-of-your-living-room-at-newteevee-live/"&gt;Sling CEO Blake Krikorian is going to talk about the future of our living room&lt;/a&gt; in a fireside chat with yours truly. The success of Hulu has awakened the Hollywood studio system to the possibilities of online video, among them the riches that don’t need to be taxed by cable companies and other gatekeepers. With that in mind, Jason Killar, CEO of Hulu, is going to be sharing his story. CSI creator and executive producer of the CSI franchise, Anthony Zuiker, seems to have figured out the magic formula for cross-platform storytelling and he is one of our &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/06/learn-about-the-future-of-your-living-room-at-newteevee-live/"&gt;keynote speakers&lt;/a&gt;. The online video industry is transitioning from being a gangly teenager to a grown-up; what remains unclear is exactly how it will evolve. I'm confident that by the end of the day we will have a better sense of what that will involve, allowing Liz, Chris and I to bring you the stories that will help all of us prepare us for this new future. &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://newteeveelive-hribbon.eventbrite.com/"&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;/a&gt; And if you can’t be present in person, we will be streaming the conference, thanks to the efforts of our partners, Ustream.

The other day, in fact, I set a personal record with 11.5 hours of them in a single work day (and I had the sore headphone ear and hoarse voice that came along with that feat). Despite this meeting load, I still had to respond to IM&#8217;s, reply to a multitude of emails, prepare slides early in the day for a presentation later on, and a host of other tasks. That begs the question:</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you effectively multitask in meetings in a way that lets you get work done?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>When you can and when you can&#8217;t</strong></p>
<p>First, you have to recognize where the multitasking opportunities are. Obviously, when you are presenting a set of slides or walking through some code to an audience, doing anything else is next to impossible. On the other end of the spectrum, if you were invited to provide details that might not even get covered to a broad group, there&#8217;s a decent chance you won&#8217;t say anything beyond introducing yourself at the top of the meeting.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the agenda shown at the beginning of the meeting. If you don&#8217;t have a copy of it, take a quick screen shot of it when it flashes by on whatever desktop sharing mechanism you are using if you can, as that will be your roadmap to multitasking potential. Take note not only of the segments where your opinion might possibly come up, but also be sure to mentally check back into the meeting every 2-3 minutes so you can assess where in the agenda things stand. That decreases the chances you&#8217;ll be caught off guard by a question when you weren&#8217;t paying attention because you were doing something else.</p>
<p><strong>Short Tasks</strong></p>
<p>David Allen&#8217;s Getting Things Done approach to task management is ideal for meeting multitasking since it breaks things down into short time segments. In using this method, whenever something comes into your inbox you assess whether or not it is something you need to keep for reference, something you can delete, something you can delegate to someone else, something you can take care of in less than 2 minutes, or something that needs a longer period of your time. Everything except that last category can be processed in the 2-3 minute time slice you create for yourself during portions of your meeting that aren&#8217;t as relevant to you as other segments.</p>
<p>Whatever task management tactics you use, there are always quick hitting items that need attention. Taking care of them while on a meeting where you can multitask keeps them from intimidatingly piling up.</p>
<p><strong>Stop and Start Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Some longer tasks lend themselves to being stopped and started in manageable intervals that can match up with those 2-3 minute segments you&#8217;ve carved out for yourself while the meeting is going on. Maybe you have some long technical article to read through that lends itself to stopping every few paragraphs to check back in with your teleconference. When a slide presentation needs to be prepared for later in the day, stopping after each slide is done so you can assess how far the meeting has progressed is another example.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Small Physical Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Paper filing, desk cleaning, reloading your beverage if you have a wireless phone &#8212; these things are primarily physical rather than mental, and lend themselves to being done while you listen to your meeting. That&#8217;s not to say you should go dig the ditch for a new sprinkler line in your back yard while on the phone, but smaller things around the desk are ripe for multitasking.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What to do when you get caught</strong></p>
<p>Make no mistake, if you frequently try to multitask during meetings you will eventually get caught. Someone will ask you a question and, because you were off multitasking, you won&#8217;t know what that question was. There are good and bad ways to recover from this situation.</p>
<p>Some will tell you to feign ignorance (&#8221;I don&#8217;t quite understand what you mean, can you rephrase the question?&#8221;). Others will tell you to pass the buck to someone else on the call (&#8221;I&#8217;m not quite the expert on that topic that Anakin is, what do you think Ani?&#8221;) However, the best way is to simply cop to it, but be careful about how you choose your words. There is a big difference between:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I wasn&#8217;t paying attention, can you repeat that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you caught me multitasking on something else for a meeting with my boss later today, can you repeat that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Both make you look bad, but the latter makes you look <em>less </em>bad. And that&#8217;s the risk you run when trying to multitask: the possibility you could look bad on your current meeting weighed against the cost of not getting as many things done throughout your business day. If you approach multitasking opportunities with a plan, though, you can mitigate that risk and be more productive.</p>
