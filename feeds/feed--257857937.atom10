<p>My interest in politics and democracy hit record levels recently. November was hope inspired with the victory of the <a href="http://change.gov/">Obama</a> movement and then by a revolt in the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/">House of Commons</a> in Canada. The <a href="http://www.gg.ca/menu_e.asp">Governor General</a>&#8217;s decision to prorogue sparked a visceral anger unlike any I&#8217;ve experienced in a long time. To me it was a technically legitimate assault on the core of our democracy - blatantly ignoring the voice of the people that we voted to represent us - the members of the House.</p>
<p>The machinations since then with the Liberals choosing to go with Ignatieff represented the continuation of the assault and a completely missed opportunity. I see the assault now as being a political culture that is interested primarily in partisan power and division with our democracy being but a set of rules to have to operate by. The spirit of democracy is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Imagine for a minute if the Liberals would have instead organized an open leadership vote among all members. What would have happened? They would have announced it - and everyone seeking to have input into the decision (everyone interested in voting for the person to challenge Harper) would have been drawn to join the liberal party simply for that priviledge.  And applying a little Obama strategy at the same time by allowing people to financially contribute to the cause (the <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/default_e.aspx">Liberal Party</a>) would have seen contributions rise dramatically.  What better way is there for the disaffected to get involved right now? I can only imagine what that could have done to change the buy-in of the people in this.</p>
<p>As we stand now I fully expect the Liberals to balk at the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=coalition">Coalition</a> and return to making this a Liberal vs. Conservative battle.  Ignatieff may well be the right leader for that and if they execute well they just might win the next election. And I would vote strategically again to try and make that happen.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem. I&#8217;m playing political games rather than debating the merits of policies and programs.</p>
<p>We need to change politics in Canada. Some things that would contribute to doing that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_democracy">Parliamentary Democracy</a> 101 </strong>(<a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">commoncraft</a> style)</li>
<li><strong>Political Culture exposes </strong>(creative examples of our politicians spouting lies and mistruths about our democratic system, fearmongering, and divisive, power hungry tactics)</li>
<li><strong>The Coalition Movement</strong> (a movement supporting the values, strengths, and benefits of coalitions in our democratic system)</li>
<li><strong>Electoral Reform</strong> (introducing <a class="zem_slink" title="Mixed member proportional representation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_member_proportional_representation">Mixed Member Proportional Representation</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s painfully clear that none of these things will happen from within the system. That&#8217;s not surprising. I do think there is hope though - and that&#8217;s through a revival of civic engagement enabled by the tools of the web and our world-class creative communities.  Already there are initiatives like <a href="http://www.fairvote.ca/"><span class="zem_slink">FairVote</span> Canada</a> and <a href="http://changegov.ca">ChangeGov.ca</a>. Those are just a couple of many (if you know one pop it in the comments). We have some of the world&#8217;s leading experts in online community building, activism, creative content, journalism, and all other things web and civic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to step up - we need them - we need everyone - we need you. I am finding my way to do my part&#8230; and for the love of Canada, I hope you do to.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*** <a href="http://theconvo.wikispaces.com">SESSION WIKI</a> NOW LIVE ***<br />
Those who know me know that this is a persistent theme with me - and now provoked by <a href="http://twitter.com/josephdee">@josephdee</a> - maybe it&#8217;s time to take this into a more focused conversation with a few more folks.</p>
<p><strong>Premise:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The way of the world is <a href="http://igniter.com/post156">borked</a>.</li>
<li>The web (among other things) is shifting the way we organize resources, ourselves and create new things (<strong>W</strong>)</li>
<li>From that (in part) is emerging a <a href="http://igniter.com/?s=mode+org+resource">new mode of organizing</a> where the organization itself (not just the product) is peer produced (<strong>PP0</strong>).</li>
<li><a class="zem_slink" title="Design" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design">Design</a> is the essential process of intentionally creating things (<strong>D</strong>)</li>
<li>&#8216;Un-borking&#8217; our world means creating our future through <strong>W+PPO+D</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The conversation I&#8217;d like to have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>is this premise (or something close to it) something that we really buy into?</li>
<li>if so, what does it mean to put it in practice ourselves?</li>
<li>how do we weave it into the practices of others?</li>
<li>what are we (each individually and collectively) doing about it?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So I ask, what do you think about the premise, the conversation, and do you want to participate in this conversation (or maybe you are already having it)?</strong></p>
<p>A couple of us have floated the idea of having a conversation at <a href="http://marsdd.com">MaRS</a> the morning of Dec. 11th. If you are interested - comment below or ping me directly.</p>
<p><em>*** Some other things that have come up in subsequent conversations around this - not sure yet how it will fit into the conversation but keep firing away.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The role of mindset is fundamental</li>
<li>&#8216;Spiritual&#8217; development and the question of &#8220;what am I&#8221; has a potentially significant role</li>
<li>My past work around <a href="http://igniter.com/post67">&#8216;The Great Remix&#8217;</a> may lend to this too</li>
</ul>

It&#8217;s a magical place and I think this would be an extraordinary experiment.</p>
<p>I also, through <a href="http://twitter.com/Igniter">Twitter</a>, heard that Jon Gosier of <a href="http://appfrica.net">Appfrica</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/appfrica">@appfrica</a>) is working on TechStars in <a class="zem_slink" title="Uganda" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=0.316666666667,32.5833333333&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=0.316666666667,32.5833333333%20%28Uganda%29&amp;t=h">Uganda</a>. There must be others thinking about doing this for social ventures/innovation. Seems like a no-brainer and the TechStars model is &#8216;open&#8217;. Anyone? Anyone?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://renewal2.ca"><img class="alignright" title="Renewal2 Investment Fund" src="http://img.skitch.com/20081117-qeqmtc6stc971aty2r213sjgxs.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="80" /></a>I recently received an update from Renewal on the development of their <a href="http://www.renewal2.ca/">Renewal2 Investment Fund</a>. In addition to hearing that the fundraising is going well in-spite of the financial crisis, I&#8217;m glad to learn that they have created an investment structure that makes it easier for foundations and others to invest across North America.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting time for foundations, and some like the <a href="http://www.wkkf.org/default.aspx?LanguageID=0">W.K. Kellogg Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx">Gates Foundation</a> are making bold moves by setting up their own <a href="http://www.wkkf.org/default.aspx?tabid=1152&amp;CID=415&amp;NID=268&amp;LanguageID=0">venture funds</a> or indicating that they are moving toward spending down (vs. preserving endowments). I hope that some more foundations take these steps and look to investing in funds like Renewal2 to spur the different forms of innovation that are possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps these structures coupled with the change in financial tides might spark some more urgent and innovative investments among foundations. As history has now proven - they can and do perform better than the market.</p>
<p>From the Renewal2 update:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have three investment entities: a Canadian Limited Partnership, a U.S. Limited Partnership and a Canadian Trust.  The U.S. LP was set up to make it much easier for U.S. individuals to participate in Renewal2.  The Canadian Trust has been set up to allow Canadian foundations to invest. We believe Renewal2 is an interesting vehicle for mission related investing by foundations.  No such trust is necessary in the U.S. as U.S. tax laws, unlike Canadian tax laws, do not prevent foundations from investing directly in LPs.  We completed the trust documentation last week so now all of the legal structures are in place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A major moment in history last night - a shift in the trajectory of our civilization.</p>
<p>This is not because of the firsts, the stats, or the policies. It&#8217;s where this comes from and how it came about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about a shift in mindset in the most dominant society in our civilization. A shift from fear to hope. From divisiveness to inclusion. From independent to interdependent.</p>
<p>911, Katrina, and the Financial Crisis successively destabilized this society&#8217;s attachment to the mindset of independence. The election and yesterday&#8217;s results give us our most concrete example of a society shifting toward a mindset of interdependence.</p>
<p>Ervin Laszlo layed out the shift in mindset needed for our civilization in hisotrical terms about 10 years ago. He described it as a shfit from extensive evolution (materialistic, conquest and consumption oriented) to intensive evlolution (centred on human development and development of human consciousness). It includes shifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>competition -&gt; reconciliation and partnership</li>
<li>greed and scarcity -&gt; sufficiency and caring</li>
<li>outer &#8220;authority&#8221; -&gt; inner &#8220;knowing&#8221;</li>
<li>separation -&gt; wholeness</li>
<li>mechanistic systems -&gt; living systems</li>
<li>organizational fragmentation -&gt; coherent integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Some quotes from Obama&#8217;s speech last night brought this home for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference.</p>
<p>It’s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.</p>
<p>It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation’s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory.</p>
<p>So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.</p>
<p>And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.</p>
<p>&#8230;reaffirm that fundamental truth – that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/minor/2008/11/05/obamas-victory-speech-transcript/">full transcript</a> is a great read, even if you watched the speech.</p>
<p>This small moment represents so much, and if it represents the tip in mindset I believe it does, then in terms of the history we are now writing, according to Laszlo we have just made a major choice for &#8216;breakthrough&#8217;.</p>
<p>I hope so because <a href="http://igniter.com/post42">he described the alternative as &#8216;doomsday&#8217;</a>. (more posts on Ervin Laszlo&#8217;s Macroshift <a href="http://igniter.com/?s=macroshift">here</a>)</p>

<p>I recently had an impromptu conversation on the <a href="http://igniter.tumblr.com/post/55443758/exploring-trust">nature of trust</a> in <a href="http://igniter.tumblr.com/">my tumblog</a> with my fellow &#8217;social catalysts&#8217; (more info coming soon). I&#8217;m fairly new to exploring this topic in this way so really appreciated the depth of responses.</p>
<p>The insights I&#8217;m left with are that there are essentially 3 dimensions to trust in facilitating a connection. Each dimension is a range that might be expressed as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The person (from &#8220;they&#8217;re not a sociopathic stalker&#8221; to &#8220;they walk on water and you&#8217;ll want to be their best friend&#8221;)</li>
<li>The subject (from &#8220;i don&#8217;t think it will hurt anyone&#8221; to &#8220;they&#8217;re going to save the world and I&#8217;m devoting my life to their work&#8221;)</li>
<li>The fit (from &#8220;it won&#8217;t be a total waste of your xyz&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;ll be the best investment of xyz you&#8217;ve ever made&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the scale might be worded a little differently but I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>I wonder, if I received a <a class="zem_slink" title="LinkedIn" rel="homepage" href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> request with 3 &#8217;sliders&#8217; on each of these dimensions how would it change the process for me? Would I be able to make decisions much quicker? What if those sliders also came with histories from that recommending party - e.g. where do these slider positions relate to the average positions of their past recommendations? Where does this rank in relation to overall value/or value on each slider compared to other connections they&#8217;ve recommended? etc..</p>
<p>And how would it change in what went into making the connection before it got to me? Would there have been more thought? Would that help filter connections? Would I lose some valuable connections somehow?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting area that I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring and testing in practice through a project that I hope to announce soon. In the meantime - the more perspectives the merrier.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expanding on my previous <a href="http://igniter.com/post271">post on micro-funds and the social venture commons</a>, here are few more pieces on what I see being the core elements of the Social Venture Commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://igniter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/social-venture-commons-themes.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-292" title="social-venture-commons-themes" src="http://igniter.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/social-venture-commons-themes.gif" alt="" width="300" height="268" /></a>First, I see the commons containing three interdependent realms:</p>
<ul>
<li>conversations</li>
<li>connections</li>
<li>accomplishments</li>
</ul>
<p>Accomplishments are the product and desired outcomes of every venture. They are also a great catalyst of conversation. Conversation, in turn, is a great catalyst of connections - connections to ideas, resources, people etc. And connections, in turn, catalyze accomplishments - new resources to help get things done better, faster, etc. Of course it&#8217;s not that linear but I do sense a compelling interrelationship and even flow there.</p>
<p>From the participant perspective I see the main players are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ventures (those tackling issues directly, those that invest in those ventures, and those that serve them)</li>
<li>individuals (those that are directly involved in the ventures, and those that are individually engaged or interested in ventures or their accomplishments)</li>
</ul>
<p>A the center of this is this idea of portfolios. Ultimately, whether you are a venture or individual in any of the above category, you are building a portfolio of accomplishments. These can be accomplishments that you are interested in and those that are you are contributing to. It&#8217;s much more granular than the organizational level and if the connections and conversations link back to the accomplishments it could be a very interesting &#8216;portfolio&#8217; incredibly rich with meaning and relevance to the &#8216;owner&#8217;.</p>
<p>The pracitcality of how this will unfold will emerge over time - from doing more than anything - but this seems like a good starting point.  There are also a couple of other core components that are operationally important to engage or nurture the connection between key players in the community. These include things like facilitating the creation of &#8216;forum groups&#8217; - a central component of the <a href="http://entrepreneurcommons.org/">Entrepreneur Commons</a> and other networks like <a href="http://www.eonetwork.org/benefits/Pages/Forum.aspx">Enterpreneur&#8217;s Organization</a>, <a href="http://ypo.org/forum.htm">Young President&#8217;s Organization</a>, and <a href="https://www.wpo.org/">World President&#8217;s Organization</a>. And for investors (of all kinds) there is the &#8216;transaction commons&#8217; with resources to support efficient and cost-effective investment transactions. While important I think they seem to be subsets of this overarching rationale - a rationale that seems new but comfortable for me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been working with some fantastic colleagues (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanwork">Duncan Work</a> and <a href="http://www.ica-associates.ca/Template/Foundations/DHprofile.cfm">Duncan Holmes</a>) on ways to harness <a class="zem_slink" title="Social capital" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital">social capital</a> (the relationship kind vs. financial kind). For me, the interest is applying it to ventures that are working toward a just and sustainable society - but, more generally, I believe it is our most underutilized form or capital and is becoming increasingly important in the current economic downturn and the <a href="http://igniter.com/post75">new mode of organization</a> that I see emerging.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been playing with other ways of communicating in presentations and taking some cues from <a class="zem_slink" title="VizThink" rel="blog" href="http://www.vizthink.com">VizThink</a> which I&#8217;ve recently been introduced to. The converegence of these two things has led to the presentation below. It&#8217;s pretty basic but I&#8217;m curious about how people respond.<br />
