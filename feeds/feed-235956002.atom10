			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I like to take generic polls or ask random people about new technologies to gauge where adoption is in the real-world since those of us that work in the industry can create real big niches and echo chambers.</p>
<p>A few recent observations include the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Last week I had the chance to speak to the first year MBA students at the <a title="Purdue Krannert School of Management" href="http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/programs/masters/home.asp" target="_blank">Purdue Krannert School of Management</a>.   I had the opportunity to speak about careers in marketing and focused on my experiences in business to business marketing and product management.   I also asked questions to the students in order to better focus the discussion and my examples. The total sample size was about a couple hundred people and it was interesting to note the social internet tools being used by this educated and connected group.
<ul>
<li>About 50% are Facebook users</li>
<li>About 20% are using Flickr or other photo service</li>
<li>About 10% are using LinkedIn, Plaxo or similar service for networking</li>
<li>No one admitted to using Twitter or a similar stand-alone micro-blogging service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few weeks ago I spent a couple days at the <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com" target="_blank">Defrag Conference</a> where just from watching the audience one would guess 99% are using Twitter or a similar stand-alone micro-blogging service.  In fact a big hit at the conference was the group Twitter stream (<a title="Defrag08 Twitter user" href="http://twitter.com/defrag08" target="_blank">http://www.twitter.com/defrag08</a>) that was set up by <a title="EventVue" href="http://www.eventvue.com/" target="_blank">EventVue</a>, the community software provider used by the conference, using the <a title="Gnip, Inc." href="http://www.gnipcentral.com/" target="_blank">Gnip Platform</a>.  At times there were dozens of people live commenting on the sessions they were attending and the conversations among participants rivaled the actual presenter.</li>
<li>While I was home for Thanksgiving I ended up trying to explain to my Mom what it is that Gnip does.   Given I started a few months ago this is the first time I had seen in person and we eventually had the &#8220;so what does the new company do that you work at&#8221;.   I really like these conversations with my Mom as it reminds me that the rest of the world knows very little about the software and technology industries &#8212; other then somehow Microsoft is bad and Apple is good, but why is not clear.   Anyway, she got the idea that Gnip makes it easy to integrate data from sources across the Internet and several of my examples.  Twitter really through her for a loop &#8212; she said &#8220;why would I want to post random thoughts and why would anyone want to read those?&#8221; and my favorite &#8220;how do you learn to get a meaningful thought in 140 characters?.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does all this mean.  I read a lot of reports from all kind of analysts on the adoption growth rates for social media as I am sure some of the people who bother reading my blog do as well.   To me it seems that we probably have farther to go for more general adoption of the new social internet tools then we like to admit in the industry, which I usually attribute to the Echo Chamber issue.   That said I remain  very confident that many of the capabilities and tools that are available today will reach mainstream adoption like earlier communication and collaboration tools have over the years &#8212; think email, sms and instant messaging.   These all several years or even a good decade or two in order to become mature and reach the mainstream.   Being just a couple years into the evolution of the social internet we are very much only on the front to middle edge of early adopters.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>I had the opportunity to use Google spreadsheets for some data gathering this week and thought I would write about my experiences.    We are using <a title="Google Apps" href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html" target="_blank">Google Apps</a> and Gmail at my company, <a title="Gnip, Inc." href="http://www.gnipcentral.com/" target="_blank">Gnip</a>, to facilitate document sharing.   However, I am one of those people that mostly uses my desktop Office apps to create documents and then I just upload them to Google Docs.</p>
<p>For a bit of research we are doing we decided to use the new Form editor in Google Spreadsheets.  (For people that want to keep up with the Google Apps team I would recommend following their <a title="Google Apps Blog" href="http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>)   I&#8217;m very excited to see a lot of <a title="New Features Google Spreadsheets" href="http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2008/10/streamlined-user-interface-launched-for.html" target="_blank">recent updates to the spreadsheets</a> and the reporting and form editors.   For our project the results were mixed.   The main reason we used the Google Spreadsheets was to try out the &#8220;data analysis&#8221; feature which auto-generates a report based on using a form for data entry.   The results were great for the questions we entered before we started entering data.  However, as happens a lot of times we can up with a few new questions after we had entered some data.  What we did was add the questions and hand entered the data to the spreadsheet for the existing entries.   The result: the hand entered data in the spreadsheet was not included in the auto-generated graphs (bummer) so we are left with a complete data set, but auto-generated graphs that do not match the full data set.    This appears to be a known issue to the Google Spreadsheet team so we look forward to new capability being added.     As for my data, I just had to generate my own complete graphs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>This being my first week at Gnip has been very interesting.   We put out a new release last night, which you can learn more about on our <a title="Gnip, Inc." href="http://www.gnipcentral.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and from some of the various write ups like this one at <a title="Gnip 2.0 Launches, With a Business Model" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/30/gnip-20-launches-with-a-business-model/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> which also covers the new products and business model for the company.</p>
<p>As the newest member of the team I am getting asked two questions by a lot of people, what are you doing? and what does Gnip do?  I <a title="I am joining Gnip" href="http://shanepearson.wordpress.com/2008/09/29/i-am-joining-gnip/" target="_blank">answered the first question in my last post</a> and will address the second question in this post and point people to the main <a title="Gnip, Inc." href="http://www.gnipcentral.com/" target="_blank">Gnip website </a>and <a title="blog.gnipcentral.com" href="http://blog.gnipcentral.com/" target="_blank">Gnip blog</a> (where I will be cross-posting a lot of content from this blog in the coming months)</p>
<p>Gnip provides a extensible messaging platform that allows for the publishing or subscribing of events and data from across the Internet, which makes data portability exponentially less painful and more automatic once it is set up.    Because Gnip is being built as a platform of capabilities and not a web application the core services are instantly useful for multiple scenarios, including data producers, data consumers and any custom web applications. Gnip already is being used with many of the most popular Internet data sources, inlcuding Twitter, Delicious, Flikr, Digg, and Plaxo.</p>
<p>So, who is the target user of Gnip?  It is a developer, as the platform is not a consumer-oriented web application, but a set of services meant to be used a developer or an IT department for a set of core use cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Consumers</strong>: You&#8217;ve built your pollers, let us tell you when and where to fire them. Avoid throttling &amp; decrease latency from hours to seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Data Producers: </strong>Push your data to us and reduce API traffic by an order of magnitude while increasing distribution through aggregators.</li>
<li><strong>Custom web application: </strong>You want to embed or publish content to be used in your own application or for a third-party application.  Decide who, or what, you care about for any Publisher, give us an end-point, and we push the data to you so you can solve your business use cases, such as customer service websites, corporate websites, blogs, or any web application.</li>
</ul>
