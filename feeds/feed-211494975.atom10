			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Many of you are in transition now, or looking at the real possibility that you&#8217;ll be in transition soon.   Or, perhaps after 20 years or so of senior manager experience you are looking for a career change.</p>
<p>Interim management isn&#8217;t for everybody, but it can be a great way to leverage your work experience and achieve a level of independence and lifestyle not possible when working as a full time employee.</p>
<p>If you want to research a career in interim management I highly recommend three books. These will give you a good understanding of what it takes to establish an interim management practice&#8211;no matter what field you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>All three of these books are available from Amazon, or other online book resellers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Leadership On Demand: How Smart CEO&#8217;s Tap Interim Management to Drive Revenue</strong></em>, by Charles Besondy and Paul Travis. (Yes, I&#8217;m plugging my own book, but it is the only book to focus on interim marketing and sales management).</p>
<p><strong><em>Interim Management, The New Career Choice for Senior Managers</em></strong> by Dennis Russell.</p>
<p><em><strong>A New Brand of Expertise, How Independent Consultants, Free Agents, and Interim Managers are Transforming The World of Work</strong></em>, but Marion McGovern  and Dennis Russell.</p>
<p>These books will help you decide whether or not to take the next step. They are also good if you are a business owner or CEO looking to hire interims.</p>
<p>If you are a senior marketing or sales manager and are seriously considering becoming an interim let me know. I can provide some free advice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>The newest <a href="http://manpower.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=38" target="_blank">Manpower employment survey</a> was released on December 9. It revealed that 67% of the companies surveyed planned to hold steady their staff levels in Q1 2009. Caution is in the wind. Most companies are taking a wait and see position and who can blaim them.</p>
<p>For really smart companies this is a great time to sock it to their competition with the help of interim marketing and sales talent, of course.</p>
<p>Taking a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; attitude doesn&#8217;t mean your company should put itself in neutral. It simply means taking a conservative stance in terms of headcount for full time employment. Use interim sales and marketing leadership to help you accomplish those mission-critical initiatives or fill key vacancies for a season. This is an opportune time to gain market share from those competitors who are hiding in their dens afraid the sky is falling.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>What if you heard that over two-thirds of companies in the U.S. plan to hold staff levels steady in Q1 2009? That sounds like pretty good news relative to what we’ve been fed by the media the past few months. Granted, it is not a time of milk and honey and some industries and metro markets are worse off than others, but let’s be thankful that most companies are taking a wait and see position rather than slashing payroll further.</p>
<p>The latest <strong>Manpower Employment Survey</strong> was released today (December 9).  Of the 31,800 employers surveyed, 16% anticipate an increase in their staff levels during Q1, while 13% expect a reduction in payrolls, 67% expect no change, and 5% are undecided.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://manpower.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=38" target="_blank">download the full report from Manpower’s site</a>. The results for their global study are also available as are reports for individual SMA’s.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ten steps that an interim marketing or sales executive can take to tune a company's revenue engine to excel in an economic downturn.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p class="MsoNormal">In light of the global economic chaos smart CEO’s recognize that this is actually an excellent time to assess and tune every aspect of the company’s revenue engine. “Business as usual” just won’t cut it because we’re not facing an “as usual” market. The time is right for an interim executive, the master mechanic of a sputtering revenue engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fresh ideas, complete honesty, and an absence of bias is required to conduct an insightful audit of the company’s revenue engine—the marketing and sales functions that lead to revenue generation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is yet another excellent scenario for using interim managers. Frankly, only an outsider can provide the unbiased perspective necessary for an accurate assessment of the inner workings of the revenue engine. Also, only a well-seasoned executive with strategic and tactical or operational experience in marketing and sales has the in-depth experience that an assessment requires.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s what one typical interim engagement might look like if aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a company’s revenue engine and realigning it for achieving 2009 revenue targets. This engagement could be lead by a VP or C-level interim marketing executive with back up from a VP-level interim sales executive (or switch the lead and backup roles).</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">Assess      characteristics and capabilities of the sales force and channel partners.      Define the ideal set of characteristics needed for success over the next      12-18 months and make recommendations how to align the organization      accordingly.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Assess      the compensation strategy and plan. Revise as necessary.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Assess      the opportunity pipeline. Just how real is the forecast?<span> </span>Revisit and adjust the opportunity      scoring methodology—remember this isn’t business as usual.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Revisit      and assess if the stages of the pipeline are well defined in light of      today’s business climate and how your customers are purchasing. Is a CRM      system being used properly?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Evaluate      if marketing and sales strategies and tactics and properly aligned to each      other and to the pipeline.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Assess      every component of the marketing plan, specifically the positioning      strategy and all lead generation activities. Are the right investments      being made? Will the marketing activities be sufficient to generate the      required leads?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">What      metrics are being used to measure marketing and sales? Are these the right      metrics or are there others that better indicate contribution to company      objectives?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Conduct      an analysis of the competitive landscape. A formal SWOT analysis is good,      but at least conduct an analysis of positioning, messaging, and direction.      How does the company compare?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Review      all customer satisfaction surveys, or if none exist conduct a survey that      includes key question for Net Promoter Score.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Assess      management. Are the right people in key roles within Marketing and Sales?      What skills are missing that should be added via training or outsourcing?</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">No doubt the list could include 20 steps or more. It wouldn’t be difficult to create another list of 10 steps with completely different activities. However, I’ve seen that if these areas are evaluated and tuned to the realities of the marketplace by un-biased, seasoned executives, the company’s revenues will jump.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this example scenario the two interim executives assigned to the engagement could conduct the assessment <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> make the majority of changes in about 3 months.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three primary benefits to engaging interim managers for this work:</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">Unbiased,      objective counsel from senior executives.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">They      drive the assessment <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> the action to make necessary changes.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">They      are focused on the engagement’s objectives while the existing management team      keeps their eyes on the day-to-day operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine: A revenue tune-up in 3 months. No loaner car required.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Example of a company electing to use interim managers to drive the business forward and preserve cash during economic downturn.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>For businesses today cash isn’t king, it is king, queen, and the Knights of the Round Table combined. Or, as we say in Texas, it is the whole enchilada.</p>
<p>Select your own metaphor, but cash preservation is top of mind for every board member, CEO and CFO right now. The level of uncertainty is off the charts, too, which adds extra incentive for a cash preservation strategy. What a great time to adopt an interim management strategy throughout the organization, especially in marketing and sales!</p>
<p>Let’s look at a typical example, simplified here for brevity.</p>
<p>For 2009 XYZ Corp had planned and budgeted to add two headcount in marketing and sales—a  senior marketing person and a senior sales operations person. Both positions were in the same pay grade with a mid-range base salary of $140k. Fully burdened each position would cost XYZ $190k per year; $225k for each position in the first year when recruitment cost was included.</p>
<p>So XYZ was looking at a $450k investment in two key players in 2009. The CEO believed both positions were critical to the company achieving its revenue goals, but that was the problem. Confidence in the revenue target was shaky.</p>
<p>The company needed the two contributors on board ASAP, but frankly the CEO was concerned about making a $450k commitment when it was unclear what the revenue picture was going to be in the second half of 2009. Heck, the first half was foggy enough.</p>
<p>The CEO and CFO weighed their options.<br />
1. Cut the two positions from the budget until revenue stream was more certain.<br />
2. Cut one of the two positions until revenue stream was more certain.<br />
3. Fill both positions and pray.<br />
4. Fill both positions with interim managers.</p>
<p>What would you do? Would you elect options 1 or 2 and effectively fold your tent? What would the opportunity cost be? Would you choose option 3 and swing for the fences even though there was a stiff wind blowing into your face from the outfield?</p>
<p>With option 4 XYZ could fill the two positions and preserve cash. Let’s look at the math.<br />
Assuming tightly scoped and highly prioritized engagements, XYZ could rapidly put seasoned interim managers into both positions for 6 months for about $250k. It’s a sound compromise that would see the highest priority tasks accomplished for 44% less.</p>
<p>A typical contract for each of the interims might look like this: 3 days per week at $1750/day for 6 months. Each interim contract is $126k, or $252k for the pair for the six months.</p>
<p>During the six months the critical aspects of each position will be accomplished, helping XYZ to reach its revenue target, but if business should suddenly worsen requiring staffing cuts the interims can be cut loose without any severance or HR issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mid-year the company still has the option of recruiting for FTEs, extending the interim contracts, or living without managers in those positions for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>The interim management solution gets the job done, keeps XYZ’s options open throughout the year, and preserves $198k in the bank.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Maintaining performance and flexibility in your Marketing and Sales teams during an economic downturn.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;  Normal 0   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4  &lt;![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;   &lt;![endif]--><!--[if !mso]&gt;--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s the annual planning season for many. Oh, what fun! Business planning is particularly challenging this year because all of us just had to throw out the crystal ball we’ve been using for the past five years—it doesn’t work anymore. <span> </span>In fact I bet many of my CEO readers have just in the past few days asked their department heads to completely revise their plans in light of reassessed revenue targets for 2009.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Who knows how long this downturn will last or how severe it will be? Keeping fixed costs low while maintaining a high degree of flexibility will be the wise choice until the fog clears and the horizon comes into focus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">There is a way to strike a near-perfect balance between having the right marketing and sales talent you need without stretching the operating budget. It’s a matter of extreme focus, prioritization, and smart resource allocation. Here’s how.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">In tough, uncertain times keep permanent staffing to a bare minimum and augment it with interim managers. This strategy holds for your leadership positions in marketing and sales, too—yes those director-, vp-, and c-level positions can be filled for a season by interim leaders. Interim management enables you to apply exactly the right quality and quantity of skills to an initiative; no more, no less. As one of my former colleagues was found of saying, “Let’s put the right amount of wood behind the arrow tip.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Performance is everything, so find the perfect interim managers and focus them like a laser on what absolutely needs to be accomplished. In most cases you’ll have on your team an interim marketing or sales leader who is a peer to you and others in the C-suite.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Less is more when it comes to the smart use of interim leadership.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">(For more tips on using interim managers in marketing and sales read<a href="http://www.leadership-on-demand.com/"> “Leadership On Demand: How Smart CEO’s Tap Interim Management to Drive Revenue”</a> by Charles Besondy and Paul  Travis.</p>

The right interim executive can transform an entire marketing department in less than six months.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>When I was in school there was no such thing as &#8220;the short bus&#8221;. Kids with special needs got on the same bus as the rest of us. I recall this situation worked fine for everyone, but I probably wasn&#8217;t paying attention.</p>
<p>At some point after I left the K-12 school system, districts started providing separate transportation for kids with special needs&#8211;those with learning disabilities and physical disabilities.  Then the term &#8220;short bus&#8221; was born because the buses were smaller. If you rode that bus you were branded by your classmates as not being as smart or as capable as they were.  Yep, kids are cruel.  &#8220;And the point is?&#8221; you ask.</p>
<p>My point is I believe <strong>most C-level execs think the people in their marketing department get off the short bus</strong> every morning.  They don&#8217;t hold their marketing people in high regard. Marketers are seen as a necessary business expense and not a strategic contributor to the organization. They aren&#8217;t viewed as people who &#8220;understand the business&#8221;. <strong>Unfortunately, in too many companies they are right.</strong></p>
<p>This can be explained in three parts. First, a <strong>lack of marketing leadership</strong> has not adequately defined the role of the marketing function within the organization. Second, there <strong>isn&#8217;t the right business acumen</strong> in the department to deliver on any mission higher than worrying about the font size on the company website. Third, the top <strong>execs in the company don&#8217;t have a clue</strong> about what marketing&#8217;s true value should be.</p>
<p>I see the caliber of people who are in most marketing positions today and I shudder. I&#8217;m not saying that marketing people are stupid. That&#8217;s not the case. I see way too many who are mis-informed, mis-guided, and ill-prepared to do much more for the business than make the logo look good.</p>
<p>SMB companies, in particular, are struggling to get high value from their investment in the marketing function, but are stuck in a no-man&#8217;s land. They generally can&#8217;t afford to hire a seasoned marketing executive who can  both train and lead the marketing department to new heights.</p>
<p>Company after company makes the mistake of thinking they can solve their sales and marketing leadership problems by paying big bucks for a VP of Sales &amp; Marketing.  Wrong! Any person with <em>sales </em>in their title will devote 95% of their time and energy to making their revenue target. Five percent of time and energy for marketing leadership doesn&#8221;t cut it.</p>
<p><strong>Enter the interim marketing executive.</strong> A SMB company may not be able to afford a permanent CMO, but they can certainly justify an interim CMO engagement, properly scoped to lead, install best practices, and train the marketing staff. <strong>The right interim executive can transform an entire marketing department in less than six months. </strong></p>
<p>Put your marketing team back on the long bus where they belong. Talk with an interim marketing executive today ( I know a few) about what they can do to boost marketing&#8217;s performance to a new level.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>Unfortunately, in the U.S. there is a certain minority of executives and investors who believe that when a company engages with an &#8220;interim manager&#8221; it is a sign of trouble for the company. This is odd thinking considering their reaction should be one of admiration that the company is shrewd enough to fill gaps with interim leadership before the gaps start dragging down the company&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>I think the negative perception stems from the belief that interims are only used in emergency turnaround situations. We&#8217;re all too familiar with the corporate announcement of an interim-CEO or interim-CFO that usually portends a serious management issue.  The logic goes that where there&#8217;s smoke there&#8217;s fire.</p>
<p>Yes, some interims specialize in turnaround situations.  Yes, that can be a signal that not all is well in the executive suite. However, the vast majority of interim assignments, especially in Marketing or Sales, are not in turnaround situations (thus far, I&#8217;ve never had an engagement in a turnaround). The presence of interim leadership is not an indication that a company is experiencing difficulties. It simply means that the company knew it had a temporary gap in leadership, skills, or resource bandwidth and elected to fill that gap with an on-demand leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interim&#8221; isn&#8217;t a nasty word, or a signal that there&#8217;s trouble in the castle. There are thousands of interims at work in the U.S. and I assure you they&#8217;re not all at work in turnaround or at-risk companies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>There is an ancillary benefit to the use of interim managers in marketing and sales functions. The on-demand executive is often in a position to provide coaching to less experienced managers in the company.  So, while the interim conducts his/her specific duties formal or informal advice and mentoring can occur.</p>
<p>Small and mid-market companies that have a philosophy of hiring and developing managers for the long term are well-suited to leverage the &#8220;seasoned&#8221; nature of interims.  Larg companies, the Fortune 500-type, have large enough management hierarchies to support internal mentoring programs, but smaller companies don&#8217;t. The experience and depth of the organization chart doesn&#8217;t support such programs.</p>
<p>The coaching can be up or down the management food chain. For instance, an interim that is engaged to be CMO for a season is frequently on a peer level&#8211;in terms of experience&#8211; with the CEO of a small or mid-market company. The intermim CMO can provide invaluable advice and coaching to the CEO.  And the CEO can listen knowing that the advice is untainted by internal politics and bias.</p>
<p>In most cases the coaching is down stream. An interim VP of Sales with 20 years of enterprise sales experience can be an extremely valuable coach to the less experienced sales managers in a company trying to sell into the enterprise market. While the interim VP of Sales is implementing processes, realigning the sales organization and its commission structure, she can also be  coaching key sales managers that the company has identified as having long-term potential with the organization.</p>
<p>Many executives pay big bucks for coaches. How sweet it is when an on-demand executive can provide that service <em>and </em>fill a leadership gap at the company, too.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><br /><p>The cover story of the March issue of <em>Inc Magazine</em> was about Zipcar, an innovative company that specializes in renting cars by the hour to its members. It&#8217;s a  very attractive concept for city dwellers and students who don&#8217;t need a car every day and may not have a safe and affordable place to park a car even if they had one.</p>
<p>When you need a car to run errands or for a day-trip to the country just reserve a Zipcar.  Pay for  what you use. <strong>Transportation on demand.</strong></p>
<p>In the same week that I read this article I spoke with a company, eVapt, that has developed a better way to meter software as a service (SaaS). The growth curve of Saas applications is impressive. No wonder. The technology allows companies to pay for how much they use of a particular software application.  Use a lot, pay more; use infrequently, pay less. Makes sense. <strong>Software on demand.</strong></p>
<p>So, when a company looks at its marketing and sales resources and sees that there are a few gaps why aren&#8217;t those gaps being immediately filled with <strong>managers on demand</strong>?</p>
<p>Too often I see companies let a vacancy in a key position go unfilled for months while the recruiting process grinds along. The smart move is to put an interim executive in the position and keep the momentum going until the perm hire  can step in.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the case of the gap in critical skills or bandwidth for a mission-critical initiative. Why aren&#8217;t more companies being honest with themselves about what their current staff can and can&#8217;t do during the time period? And we wonder why product launch dates are missed or compromised. Evaluate where special skills and experience are needed and add a seasoned interim manager to the team.</p>
<p><strong>Using interim management resources today seldom is an indication that a company is in trouble. It means companies are being really smart about resource allocation.</strong> Alas, old perceptions are slow to change.</p>
<p>We look at customers who use Zipcar and say, &#8220;Good thinking. Use a car whenever you need it, but only pay for what you use.&#8221; We see companies that save millions of dollars a year by adopting SaaS instead of traditional software licensing.  We think, &#8220;Wow, those guys are really using their cash wisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think when a company, perhaps your own, considers an interim management solution?</p>
