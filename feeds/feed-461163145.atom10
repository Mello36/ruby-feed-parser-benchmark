<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hersheys/3083886189/" title="wrappedinbacon by Chan Hin-ching, on Flickr">Figure 1.</a> Mushroom bacon yakitori at Nishiki Japanese Restaurant</p>
<p>They usually come in bamboo skewers. In pairs. Except that, someone had a piece in her mouth by the time I manage to grab my camera out. One can never go wrong with grilled bacon. <span style="line-height: normal; white-space: pre;">Yummy</span>! The green pepper and mushroom add substantial new flavours to the food itself; making each bite a heavenly experience in itself. Definitely give this dish a try the next time you eat at Nishiki.<br />
<strong>Do take note, the above dish is a non-halal.</strong></p>

<p>As I am typing this entry out, my ears are glued to this song by Andy William – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBb5y8IHAtE">Music To Watch Girls By</a> on my playlist. Which could certainly have served as great opening song when the models started parading on stage at the annual Sabah Supermodel Search/Manhunt Semifinals earlier this week of which I attended with a few friends in support of a classmate who participated as well.</p>

<p>Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t be in the best position to tell you which one catwalked the best. Or perhaps which one wooed the crowd more. Well except for this guy, Contestant No. 12 who really knew how to worked up the crowd with his poses (<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/3082542924_bbb1333c35_o.jpg">see one here</a>). Absolutely humorous. All the girls were pretty, tall and apparently young. The guys on the other hand had some weak contestants which stood out among the other better-looking guy contestants.</p>

<p>The weekend before last, there were two significant book sales here – Popular Bookshop and Time Bookshop. Not too long ago, a book warehouse sale was unheard of. Choices were fairly limited back then. You would have the independent retail bookshops such as Iwase (now closed) and Penguin on Gaya Street. But they weren&#8217;t pro-sales though. The choices of books at Popular&#8217;s sale was fairly limited (I went to the one in City Mall) but Time&#8217;s had a larger inventory – easily ten times more than the books Popular had for sale and up to a discount of 90%.</p>
<p class="captions"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3161/3050844809_07c42b60ea_o.jpg" alt="threebooks" width="580" height="297" /><br />

<p>Okay, I did manage to get a few books myself except the cooking book above which was a gift from Patient No.9. You&#8217;ll be in a for a treat if you are into fiction books.</p>
<p>Times and Popular seem to be adequate for the current market. Though I wouldn&#8217;t mind if a <a href="http://www.kinokuniya.com/">Kinokuniya</a> opened here. <strong>Wouldn&#8217;t you?</strong></p>

I&#8217;m sure most of you do that, do you? Last night, I watched Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/madagascar2/" title="Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa movie trailer">watch trailer</a>) and immensely enjoyed it. And yes. I made sure we stayed for the credits for this movie. In the credits, the main characters: Marty the zebra, Alex the lion, Gloria the hippo, Melman the giraffe, along with some of the supporting cast reappear in the end credit sequence as animated 3D paper models set against hand painted background images sporting African-like geometric patterns. Of which I find it interesting seeing the characters in a different form of media – paper sculptures.</p>
<p>The film itself is a good 90 minutes of entertainment and laughter. <strong>When are you going to watch it?</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s just stunning how two carefully constructed lives can clash into each other — because of YOU. Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. Heck. Girl meets girl. Boy meets boy. Some of you might call it destiny. And perhaps a bit of luck. They lighten up a chapter in our lives and quite often leave with a larger impact than expected.</p>
<p>Dear Love, I do not hate you. But chances are you are pushing it. Like how my sister would put it: <a href="http://www.shukling.com/entries/105" title="Shuk Ling: 生氣你">生氣你 (LOVE)!</a> Where is my other bitter friend when I need cheering up? Sigh. 生氣你! 生氣你!</p>

<p>Upon arriving the restaurant, you&#8217;ll be greeted by rows of owl figurines and assorted items displayed prominently in front of the restaurant before being whisked into the restaurant by one of the staff members. The staff there are courteous and well-trained — so don&#8217;t hesitate if you need a recommendation. Food waiting times are not too bad though it usually falls down to the type of food you had ordered.</p>
<p>If you do realize by now, the restaurant takes its name from the common owl, which is in fact a traditional symbol of good luck in Japan: &#8220;kurou&#8221; means trouble, &#8220;fu&#8221; means not or no — of which when put together means no troubles. And if it is any indication of the future of the restaurant, I hope that this restaurant is one to stay. Trouble-free.</p>

<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;float:right;display:inline;width:280px">Food portions are decent. Ideally, a set meal and a sushi dish or two should be just right for one.</p>

I gave her a morning call only to be taken for granted. She was waiting for the follow-up call — of which I have conveniently forgotten. And if it was entirely my fault, I got her to the skin clinic five minutes late as patient no.9. Not no.1 but no.9. You should have seen her face when I walked into the clinic. It riddled me with guilt. And for the past two and half hours, there I sat waiting for her. Listening to Michael Learns to Rock for the umpteenth time (and an assortments of oldie songs) whilst accompanying Patient&#8217;s no.9.</p>
<p>After the appointment, we were later joined by Freda for brunch at Shikai Restaurant in the city. We ordered an old favourite – Fried Kuey Teow followed with the usual dim sums. I&#8217;m quite fond of the interior of this restaurant consisting of mainly dark wood furniture, circular tables and asian calligraphy sprawled across its walls. The restaurant is a bit dark during the night (probably due to bad lighting) but during the day, it lits up perfectly with the available daylight from outside.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d recommend highly to come here for dimsum mornings and evening dinners.</strong></p>

<p>You can find Shikai Restaurant at G15 &amp; G16 of Kompleks Asia City. Toilets are on the first floor just in case you need to where they are.</p>

<p style="margin-top:3em">There I was on stage. Or at least how I came to realize it when my sense kicked in. Standing in front of a crowd at BED past midnight. What was i THINKING? People do the craziest things under the influence of alcohol but this was RIDICULOUS. I didn&#8217;t had that much to begin with. Or at least not as much as the one beside me had. She was waving to the crowd – Miss World style. Embarrassingly to say, I did a few hops with my arms straightened out. Mimicking what I was dressing as. <strong>Who do you think I dressed as?</strong> <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2995046445_be9ccfc2bc_o.jpg">See clue here</a>.</p>

<p>First things first, I had make-up on. <a href="http://www.frankiefong.com.au" title="Frankie Fong Makeup">Frankie</a> would have been proud. Despite shutting my eyes the whole time. I had smoky eyes and a bit of blush over a layer of foundation. And I had hair extensions on! This was how I spend my Halloween this year. And don&#8217;t forget, I was runner up in the best dressed costume at BED! Happy Halloween.</p>

Figure 1. World&#8217;s longest insect
When I was 3, Dad met a farmer who handed over this huge stick insect he found somewhere at Ulu Moyog in Penampang district and realised that it could be a totally new species. He paid RM6 for it. Yesterday, his stick insect and him made world news.

<p><img style="padding-right:10px" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3264/2903777770_540fb145c1_o.png" alt="dearlove" width="64" height="64" align="left" />I have always been intrigued about you – how you can influence a person to build a monument (Taj Mahal) for his one true love. Or how the greatest love letters ever written were in a time of war and hardship with both sides separated by oceans. Ironically, if there was <a href="http://www.skype.com/" title="Skype">Skype</a> back then, people will be writing much less about you. Or perhaps how <a href="http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=59979" title="Viviana Yew, will you marry me">this guy</a> can justify paying for advertising space to propose to his love in Damai. But so it seems, I fell for you too.</p>
<p>Knowing Yien was quite fond with vinyl bear toys, with my limited illustration skills, I designed her one. A limited-edition, if you could put it that way and probably the only one I will ever design ever. It took me almost a month, finding time between work and 家好月圆. But I did finish it — finally. It&#8217;s really quite a piece of art if you see it from afar.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like it?</strong></p>
<p class="captions"><img style="border:none" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2925068705_7faed5d42f_o.jpg" width="580" height="280" alt="toybrickbear" /></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:1.5em;text-align:center;padding-right:20px; float:left;display:inline;width:280px"><strong>01.</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Being a left hander, to avoid smudging while I draw, I started from right to left. The legs were mostly infused with illustrations of food we both love. Lots.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:1.5em;text-align:center;float:right;display:inline;width:280px"><strong>02.</strong><br />
The idea came to me quite late but I think it worked out quite nice: Me and her are seen peeking out from the zipped enclosure behind the bear itself. Though I&#8217;m finding the peace sign a bit overdone.</p>

<p><img style="padding-left:10px" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3118/2912431892_27e8dea454_o.jpg" alt="dearlove" width="128" height="128" align="right" />One of the few Japanese restaurants in Kota Kinabalu I would recommend. Michi Japanese Restaurant offers a perfect combination of great-cooked dishes and sushi at bargain prices (not cheap but you get what you pay for!). Its soft, dark ambience furnished with dark furniture and an elevated section for the tatami-inspired seating sets the scene for exploring classic Japanese gastronomy. The friendly, hardworking staff does its best in serving you — close to the type of 5-star service you would receive at <abbr title="Shangri-La's Tanjung Aru Resort and Spa">STAR,</abbr> making that 10% service charge (mine was RM21.20!) much bearable to pay for.</p>
<p>Being Mum&#8217;s birthday today, earlier tonight, I treated her and the rest of the family to dinner at Michi. This is perhaps the first time in four years that I&#8217;ve celebrated my Mum&#8217;s birthday with her as I was in Australia previously which made it an even more memorable dinner.</p>
<p class="captions"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/2911582675_85ec4561f3_o.jpg" alt="Michi Japanese Restaurant" width="580" height="435" /> Figure 2. A close-up shot of Michi&#8217;s Shimeji Itame dish (RM19.00)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s undeniable that I love my enoki. Michi has a variety of japanese mushroom dishes though be warned that they do get cold quite fast so eat right away when it is served. The one above is Shimeji Itame dish sauteed with butter topped with dancing fish flakes.</p>
<p class="captions"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3014/2911583197_4499a3f6f2_o.jpg" alt="Michi Japanese Restaurant" width="580" height="435" /> Figure 3. A close-up shot of sashimi (RM46.00)</p>
<p>For anyone who&#8217;s keen on sashimi, we were informed that presently, shipments of sashimi come in every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. A good idea is to arrange your next visit on these days to ensure the freshest foods.</p>
<p class="captions"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3107/2911582801_357153905f_o.jpg" alt="Michi Japanese Restaurant" width="580" height="435" /> Figure 4. A close-up shot of Michi&#8217;s Agedashi Nasu (Fried eggplant) (RM9.00)</p>
<p>You can find Michi Japanese Restaurant (C-306 &amp; C-307) on the concourse floor of 1 Borneo Hyper Mall right beside Penang Village. The gesture of making a reservation beforehand is always appreciated but optional over here in Kota Kinabalu. If you do want to make a reservation, give them a call at +6088 485 306.</p>

We find things to distract ourselves. Keep ourselves occupied. Which of course is the most logical course of action. And whether it is working. I can&#8217;t tell you just yet. It was all fun. For me, anyhow. To accompany <strong>044</strong> dog-walking on a weekend evening at the nearby park. Maybe it&#8217;s because of the unconditional love that dogs offer. Or doing something out of the ordinary. Point being, is unconditional love a myth?</p>

Meet <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Nisha Sylvia Sashikumar. For us, just Nisha will do. Don&#8217;t play play. This dog even has a Facebook profile of its own.</span></span></p>

Quite the reminiscence of my earlier childhood is the Capilla soft ice cream truck which most of us grew up listening to its jingles while it roamed our neighborhoods.</p>

Does letting a dog loose in an enclosed park considered dog walking? Lots of the parks we visited were mostly abandoned except for the basketball courts popular with youngsters.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: center; float: right; display: inline; width: 280px;"><strong>04.</strong><br />
Meet Moshi. A handsome lad whom we brought Nisha to meet last weekend. Presently, Moshi is showing a high level interest in Nisha. <em>Horny</em> dog.</p>

<p><strong>Mooncakes</strong></p>
<p>The family received our first box of mooncakes from Yien this year. It somehow amazes me the variety of mooncakes come in year after year: greentea, durian, yolk, icecream, jelly and others too long to list. Despite not being avid mooncake lovers ourselves, we do our fair share of sampling mooncakes we do receive. Especially the &#8216;contemporary&#8217; flavours. </p>
<p>Just like any other family, we regift our mooncakes where we seem fit and keep the better ones to ourselves.<em> Hahahaha.</em> This mooncake season, there was no other better place to purchase them than at Tong Hing Supermarket. They have did an excellent job importing a variety of mooncakes from Hong Kong, Singapore and West Malaysia &#8212; giving our design-making skills a worthy test.</p>
<p><strong>The better mooncakes are always more expensive if you&#8217;ve noticed!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lanterns</strong></p>
<p>All kids go through a phase where they realize there&#8217;s more fun in seeing a lantern burn than have it dangled at the edge of a piece of stick. I did. That was probably the last time I touched a lantern. Nonetheless, a lantern session after dinner was necessary for my younger cousins this time round. Sadly for the heavy rain, it was indoors though we did manage to get a glimpse of a bunch of kids with their lanterns in raincoats that night! </p>
<p>The lantern procession ended up at the neighbour&#8217;s house instead just because my relatives weren&#8217;t ready to sacrific the house lights for a better &#8216;tanglung&#8217; experience. I peeked over later on to notice &#8212; closely resembling a ritual of some sort &#8212; all their lanterns hung on a window sill with a circle of candles on the ground. -_-&#8221; Kids.</p>
<p><strong>How was your mid-autumn festival this year?</strong></p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hersheys/2822517743/" title="Piano serenade by Chan Hin-ching, on Flickr">Figure 1.</a> The home piano with a wobbly bench</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been playing the piano, hoping to serenade Yien with a short piece of mine before her departure. Over the past weeks, each morning, I slip downstairs quietly, I sit myself in front of the piano and attempt to create music. Every evening, I do the same. Frankly, it&#8217;s hard to justify how music is created without any experience. It&#8217;s even harder to explain how I can play with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>Very early on in my life, I knew I wasn&#8217;t gifted in music or singing for that matter. I&#8217;ve embarrassed myself singing to her before ONCE. Frogs could have done a better job. Probably it&#8217;s due to that reason, I didn&#8217;t sing during my virgin visit to KBox last weekend. My younger sister tells me the secret is just to scream the song out instead of singing it out. She has a point.</p>
<p>When I play with my eyes closed, I think of her and I just play. Almost mimicking Beethoven or perhaps Chopin. Well, barely. Hahaha. They say music is what feelings sounds like. I play only for an audience of one yet I am so cautious of what she thinks… Am I going to embarrass myself again? A performer always seek the applause of his audience at the end of each performance. I do too.</p>
<p><strong>Now before I do start, would everyone just stand up and give me an applause first?</strong></p>
<p>p.s. Yien plays the piano. Pretty well actually.</p>
