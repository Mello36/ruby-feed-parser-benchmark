The forever scorned IE6 has always had issues with alpha PNGs, those semi-transparent images of goodness. The market share of IE6 is surprisingly big, especially for more mainstream sites and web developers such as you and me are still left holding the bag to support them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoyan Stefanov, one of the people behind &lt;a href="http://smush.it/"&gt;Smush.it&lt;/a&gt;, has posted the &lt;a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/12/08/imageopt-5/"&gt;fifth installment of image optimization on the the YUIblog&lt;/a&gt;. This time on AlphaImageLoader. Stoyan discusses the performance issues involved in using the IE-only filter with some really interesting information. It's definitely worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew Diller, of whom took my VML rounded corners to the next level with &lt;a href="http://dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_roundies/"&gt;DD_roundies&lt;/a&gt;, is back with another script, specifically aimed to fix the alpha PNG issue. After noticing that the VML supported alpha PNGs, Drew took on the task of isolating the functionality and to ensure that background-position and background-repeat were properly supported as well. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_belatedPNG/" target="`"&gt;DD_belatedPNG&lt;/a&gt; for more info and lots of examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

I tried to come up with a way to mimic border-radius and to be able to implement simple rounded corners into a design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first implementation I saw that tried to do this in a seamless way was Remiz of HTML Remix. The &lt;a href="http://www.htmlremix.com/curved-corner-border-radius-cross-browser/"&gt;implementation uses an HTML control&lt;/a&gt; (ie: an htc file) that can be easily bound to any element which should have rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew Diller has pointed me to his implementation, &lt;a href="http://dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_roundies/"&gt;DD_roundies&lt;/a&gt;, which he has just released. His code has the added benefit of allowing tiled alpha PNGs without using AlphaImageLoader (an unexpected discovery). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping, once again, that IE8 will magically support border-radius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The past six months have been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride when it comes to the success of SidebarAds. Now seems as good a time as any to provide a status report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those unfamiliar with my ongoing saga in online advertising, be sure to read the &lt;a href="http://snook.ca/archives/business/sidebarads/"&gt;announcement post from June&lt;/a&gt;, along with my previous discussion on &lt;a href="http://snook.ca/archives/business/running_own_advertising/"&gt;self-managed advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were off to a great start  getting a couple advertisers early on. Since then, though, it's been hit or miss. While we've managed to get new advertisers on board, it hasn't been consistent and I often failed to do any follow-up to ensure that advertisers would continue their campaigns. The recurring theme from before is certainly the lack of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the custom ad system that we have in place provided a new level of automation over what I had before (read, nothing), there was still plenty of areas where I had to manage that myself, such as approving ads, handling payouts, and so on. I'm actually in the midst of making a number of admin changes in order to make it easier to manage the campaigns and ensure that advertisers don't get forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hired&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we've officially hired an ad manager: &lt;a href="http://xhipi.com/"&gt;Matthew Oliphant&lt;/a&gt;. He'll be managing things in his spare time, helping advertisers with their campaigns and getting new advertisers on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relinquishing control is something that I need to learn to do in a few aspects of my life and I'm really happy to have Matthew helping out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SidebarAds has also expanded in other ways. When we originally launched, &lt;a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/"&gt;Roger Johansson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/"&gt;Paul Stamatiou&lt;/a&gt; were part of the gang. Shortly after launch, Nathan Smith's &lt;a href="http://sonspring.com/"&gt;Sonspring&lt;/a&gt; and Rogie King's &lt;a href="http://www.komodomedia.com/"&gt;Komodomedia&lt;/a&gt; came on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had a lot of requests from people looking to join the network, putting SidebarAds on their site, and that was something that I honestly didn't foresee. We've had to take it slow and steady when it comes to adding more sites to the network to ensure that we had enough money to pay everybody (in other words, that we had enough advertisers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the last couple weeks, we've added two more sites to the network: &lt;a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/"&gt;Elliot Jay Stocks&lt;/a&gt; and Andy Clarke's &lt;a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/"&gt;For a Beautiful Web&lt;/a&gt;. We're really happy to have them as part of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're not looking to add any more sites as of right now, if you're interested in joining the network, definitely get in touch. We've got a list of sites that we'd eventually like to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing the Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other surprising parts of this whole enterprise has been the inquires from a few people interested in licensing the engine that we use to power the network. Other people want to create their own boutique ad network using the same system that we have. While we don't have the number of features that other ad tools have, we are now looking at what we need to do to get the adminstration tools in place to power such a system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There have been some definite surprises over the past six months and once again, it'll be interesting to see where things stand six months from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Am I sending what I'm supposed to? Am I getting back the right response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most JavaScript developers have Firebug locked and loaded but its requirement to post data back to the server just to inspect the request isn't always a very pracitical solution. The information you get back may not always be the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative otions include firefox addons &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829"&gt;Live HTTP Headers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6647"&gt;HttpFox&lt;/a&gt;. These are great options for quick and dirty sniffing but for a more thorough and featureful solution, there's only one tool that I go to: &lt;a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/"&gt;Charles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://snook.ca/img/charles-ss.png" alt="The Charles application on the Mac with the Sequence tab selected shows two panes of status information." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles ia a cross-platform desktop application that acts as a proxy for all web requests, no matter what browser they come from; it can even inspect Flash-originated requests and Adobe AIR application requests. As the proxy, it's able to see all the information flowing back and forth and provide a detailed peek at every request and response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite features &amp;mdash; and where it stands out from the Firefox addons &amp;mdash; is the ability to view XML, JSON and even AMF data structures. It's easy to see right away if a request was successful or not and you get access to all of the request and response headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox manages its own proxy server settings and requires a Charles addon which can be downloaded from the Charles web site. This will allow Charles to automatically turn on the proxy  with no other intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two minor issues with it, though. For one, Charles can cause SSL certificate error messages for HTTPS connections. Secondly, while it can replay a request (and allow you to edit what information is sent in that request), you can't see that replay within the browser. For this reason, I like to use Live HTTP Headers in this situation, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; allow you to do this, although its interface is awkward and prone to generate server errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, &lt;a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/"&gt;Charles&lt;/a&gt; is a staple of my toolset and one o	f my favourite tools for request and response inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

When I developed for MS SQL Server, I used to use the query tool that came bundled. Then I switched to working mostly with MySQL and have bounced around various apps including the query browser and migration tools provided by MySQL. Eventually I had settled on SQLYog as it had provided one key feature: the ability to edit a query result. It's been a very handy feature and much of the maintenance for Snook.ca happens via my GUI app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my switch to the Mac, I discovered that &lt;a href="http://www.webyog.com/en/"&gt;SQLYog&lt;/a&gt; wasn't able to come along for the ride. I quickly went on the search for something to fill the void. The first app that came to mind, and that others recommended, was &lt;a href="http://www.mjmedia.com.au/sequel-pro.html"&gt;Sequel Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it didn't quite fit the bill. It lacked the editable query result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was &lt;a href="http://navicat.com/"&gt;Navicat&lt;/a&gt;. Navicat does support editable query results and, as a result, I've switched to using it full-time. It's easy to use and has all the features I'd expect. You can do user management, edit views and stored procedures, save custom queries, and the table browser supports pagination, filtering and multi-column sorting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only major complaint about the edit mode is the default entry mode which doesn't allow for MySQL functions. You can quickly turn on raw mode by hitting Command-Enter but it feels awkward. I'd rather an option for it to default to raw mode or allow Command-Enter to execute the change in raw mode. In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor niggle and only because it's differen than the workflow that I've become accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that have to bounce from platform to platform, Navicat is available on Windows, Mac and Linux and has versions that support MySQL, PostgreSQL and  Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mac version lags behind the Windows version when it comes to supported features but I'm told that version 8 will be out next year supporting features its counterpart has such as the Form View and code completion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'm happy with Navicat and will likely continue to use it as my default MySQL admin tool.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

First DOS, then any number of  Windows iterations. From 95, to 2000, to XP. It's been a long streak that has finally come to an end. I have switched to a Mac as my primary machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did it take so long? I jokingly say that I've harboured a grudge against Apple ever since they ditched the IIgs for the Mac. Truth is, I was comfortable. I had the applications that I liked to use and a configuration where I knew where everything was. Then I got sucked into getting an iPhone back in June. I even stood in line for half a day to get one and I haven't regretted it for one day since. In the meantime, my old laptop was starting to feel the burden of almost 3 years of use and abuse. I've been monitoring the price gap between a similarly configured Dell laptop and a Macbook Pro. The divide was wide, providing little incentive to make the switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I heard of a new Macbook Pro to come out in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the reveal in earnest. Then, I quickly leaped to the Internet to do a price comparison. I noticed the price gap was down to $300. That's a more reasonable price gap. I placed an order. I even ordered a 1TB Time Capsule to go along with it. Might as well go whole-hog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that it has been a week, here are my thoughts on the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time Capsule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Capsule arrived a couple days before the laptop did and I didn't hesitate to set it up. I chose the Time Capsule because I was enticed by the all-in-one nature of it. It's an automated backup, wireless router, file server, and print server all in one. In fact, this is the first time since I've started computing that I've had a formal backup practice in place. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been working well but my biggest pet peeve is trying to use it as a file server. If I haven't accessed the Capsule in some time, it takes a few seconds for things to power up. Otherwise, no complaints. It does what it says on the box and the automated backups via Time Machine have been painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macbook Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the MBP arrived. All 2.53Ghz, 4GB, 250MB 7200RPM hard drive of it. I was instantly awed by the experience of getting it set up. It was truly a delight. I had a smile from ear to ear. Yet, after an hour or so I noticed that I seemed to be running on battery power. A defective power supply, it seems. Despite not getting very hot, I discovered that putting the brick on a block of ice gave me hours of usage instead of minutes. I got Apple to send out a replacement post-haste. In the meantime, I picked up a second power supply and was pleased as punch with having persistent power. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dove right in and made the laptop my primary machine. No sense delaying the inevitable. I even put  my session for the Sidebar Workshop on it, although it wouldn't detect the screen properly where all the other Macbooks of the day did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past week has been spent installing plenty of software and getting used to the new environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main applications I have installed already include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adobe CS4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iWork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transmit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Textmate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adium&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zend Studio (since I already had a license for it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sequel Pro (I'm not loving it. Not as good as SQLYog.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropbox, Desktoptopia, and other utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My transition has been mostly painless. With that said, there have been some things that I haven't been overly thrilled with. I find Mail.app limiting. Although I'm told that plugins fill the gap there. I'm thinking of trying Entourage but plenty of people have told me that it's a resource hog. Getting email off the old machine was a minor inconvenience but I was able to use Thunderbird to export the mail from Outlook and then use Mail.app to import the mail from Thunderbird. It worked perfectly, from what I can tell. My contacts got ported via the iPhone, which was handy. Lastly, I'm not loving iCal either. The integration of to-do items isn't as slick as it was with Outlook. It doesn't seem to send out calendar responses nor allow you to suggest changes to an event that somebody else creates. (If you know how, let me know)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the last major piece of software I need to install is the VMWare/Vista combo for Windows testing. Now to get my hands on a copy of VMWare. In the meantime, I have Crossover that I can use for IE6 testing, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trackpad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite part of the whole laptop is the trackpad. The ability to do two, three and four finger swipes is fantastic. I use it constantly. So much so, that I don't want a separate keyboard and mouse. The keys are well spaced so I don't feel like I'm mashing away on a tiny keyboard. It's quite comfortable. My only complaint is that the edge of the laptop has a hard edge and doesn't make it conducive to resting your wrists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Monitors and Spaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things I've noticed is less of a need for multiple monitors or using Spaces to separate what I'm working on. When I was on Windows, more screen space was welcome. Yet, with the magnificent trackpad, I find them cumbersome. As a result, I'm just using the laptop screen and haven't had a problem with it. Once I get back into the flow of heavy development, we'll see if that still holds true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glossy screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people were curious about the screen but I had a glossy screen before. Neither bother me. The screen is so bright it breaks through any glare you might have. The screen is so bright that I usually turn it down. The screen is so bright that someone looked at my screen and said, &amp;quot;that's bright&amp;quot; only for me to turn the brightness up further. Some muttering from said individual could be heard. (I've turned down the brightness on the iPhone, as well, for the same reason.) I do find myself being more particular about keeping the new screen clean, though, as I do notice specks more readily. That can only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a purchase that I have no regrets about. I'm happy to have made the switch. I can finally feel cool when I go to a web conference and not be the loner with the Windows laptop. More than that, I just like how the machine looks and feels. It's well constructed and perfect for my needs right now.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Then you want to click on another item and have it to be set as active. Maybe it's navigation, maybe it's tabs. This is a common pattern. So much so, that I've rewritten this code a few times but keep losing track of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a jQuery plugin that does the ol' switcheroo and is very simple. When you click on an element, it'll set it as active. When you click on another, it'll remove the active class from the currently active item and then enable the active item. Super simple, nothing more, nothing less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(function($){
   $.fn.switcheroo = function(els){
      this.each(function(){
         var p = $(this);
         $(els||'li', p).click(function(){
            $('.active', p).removeClass('active');
            $(this).addClass('active');
         });
      });
   }
}(jQuery));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it can be attached to an element using a couple different approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('ul').switcheroo();
$('ul').switcheroo('a');&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is most often used with lists, the first line of code omits any parameter as the plugin automatically looks for LIs contained within the parent element. However, if you want to be specific, you can specify the selector as the one and only parameter. That's all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can, of course, be used as a basic framework for building additional functionality in, like callback functions and animations. In any case, you can check out this &lt;a href="http://snook.ca/technical/switcheroo.html"&gt;demo page&lt;/a&gt; to see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Come join us in Washington D.C. on November 12th as we step through the front-end development of an example project. We'll go from the design process through to implementation with plenty of take-home tricks along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an intermediate-level workshop targeted to those who already have some experience doing front-end development and are looking to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey"&gt;sharpen the saw&lt;/a&gt; or expand their skills in specific areas, be they design, slicing, HTML, CSS or JavaScript. We'll be touching on a variety of tools including Adobe Photoshop &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original early-bird pricing was today and while we've &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/snookca/statuses/942698737"&gt;Twittered&lt;/a&gt; about the upcoming workshop, we didn't have a chance to blog about it until now. So, to be fair, we're extending the early-bird price of $499 until this Friday (the date on the site will be updated shortly). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaking of Twitter, be sure to follow @&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sidebarworkshop"&gt;sidebarworkshop&lt;/a&gt; for ongoing details of this and future workshops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small workshop with only 30 spots &amp;mdash; well, less than that now since we've already sold a bunch! Be sure to &lt;a href="http://sidebarworkshops.com/2008/washingtondc/"&gt;get your seat now&lt;/a&gt; before they're all gone. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Locations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most common request we get is, &amp;quot;come to my town!&amp;quot; We hear you! We're already finalizing plans for a San Diego workshop in January and we'll be posting the details soon. If you'd like us to come to your town, &lt;a href="http://sidebarcreative.com/training/#contact-form"&gt;feel free to let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the position of the background image felt to be the best approach to creating the type of effect we're looking for (and I'm not the first to think so: see the examples at the end of this article). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jQuery is a great library for this type of task but out of the box, it can't animate background position properly because of the need to animate two values instead of just one (too bad not all browsers implemented the non-standard background-position-x and -y like Internet Explorer). Grab the latest version (1.0.2 as of this writing) of the &lt;a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/backgroundPosition-Effect"&gt;Background-Position plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Previous versions didn't support negative or decimal values properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes adding extra HTML to pull off all the fancy stuff and therefore, we're looking at a very simple unordered list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;About&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Contact&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Basic CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, I've just floated the navigation and set each of the links to display block with a little padding. Nothing fancy (which is the whole point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ul {
	list-style:none;
	margin:0;
	padding:0;
}&lt;br /&gt;li {
	float:left;
	width:100px;
	margin:0;
	padding:0;
	text-align:center;
}&lt;br /&gt;li a {
	display:block;
	padding:5px 10px;
	height:100%;
	color:#FFF;
	text-decoration:none;
	border-right:1px solid #FFF;
}&lt;br /&gt;li a {
	background:url(bg.jpg) repeat 0 0;
}&lt;br /&gt;li a:hover {
	background-position:50px 0;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that a hover state has been declared. Users who visit the page without JavaScript will, at least, still be able to view the final state. I've declared the background on the &lt;code&gt;li a&lt;/code&gt; separately to make it stand out, but an initial background position needs to be set along with the background image you want to use for the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pull off different types of effects by creating your image in a particular fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/bg2.jpg" alt="Swipe" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: The Swipe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, the before and after states are on the left and right but a simple slant can create an interesting effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/bg3.jpg" alt="Swipe" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: The Fade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 is a little more elaborate. The amount of visible space in the normal and hover states are at the very top and bottom of the image. The large gradient in the middle generates a fade-in/out effect when animated over time. The larger the gradient, the less it'll feel like it's moving in from the bottom and feel more like it's actually fading in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the image allows the file size to be small, as well. More complex animations with more colour depth would require a larger file size. Always strike a balance between the effect and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/"&gt;demo page&lt;/a&gt; to see how these two effects (and a couple others) look in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the script to put this altogether is really straightforward. The animation needs to run when the user moves their mouse over and out of the navigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('#nav a')
	.css( {backgroundPosition: "0 0"} )
	.mouseover(function(){
		$(this).stop().animate(
			{backgroundPosition:&amp;quot;(0 -250px)&amp;quot;}, 
			{duration:500})
		})
	.mouseout(function(){
		$(this).stop().animate(
			{backgroundPosition:&amp;quot;(0 0)&amp;quot;}, 
			{duration:500})
		})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements are captured via the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; function and given a default CSS. This is necessary for both Internet Explorer and Firefox 2, which don't report the default background position. In IE, you can get around the issue using background-position-x and -y but it's easier just to set the initial values in the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the elements are animated using the &lt;code&gt;mouseover&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mouseout&lt;/code&gt; events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to note is that any animation is stopped before attempting to animate again. This avoids animations queuing up from repeatedly moving the mouse in and out of the element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jQuery also has a &lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; method which can be used instead of separately using the mouseover and mouseout methods. The reason I didn't was because I like the clarity that is provided by explicitly declaring them. The hover method takes two parameters: the function to run when over and the function to run when out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/"&gt;the demo page&lt;/a&gt;, I've created four separate animations. Just hop to the source to see how it was all put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other jQuery Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I'm certainly not the first to come up with this idea. Check out these other resources for more jQuery navigation animation exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite that, we hadn't seen any books come out focused on the framework. Thankfully, not one but two books came out recently including &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1847193897/?tag=snookca0f-20"&gt;CakePHP Application Development by Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at Packt were kind enough to send me a copy and it turned out to be a fairly quick read. It's 300 pages of good starting knowledge. The book is targeted as an introduction to the framework and not meant as a definitive guide (to which the book would likely need to be three times the size to accomplish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's inside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with an overview of concepts such as MVC and how CakePHP is designed to speed development. The book then discusses installation including installation on  Windows. After which, it quickly dives into a To-do application to demonstrate how quickly an application can be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book covers Controllers, Models, how relationships work, and Views. It also touches on components and helpers. One of the nice pluses is that the book covers the CakePHP shell scripts for quick creation of application code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining four chapters are focused on building a sample application called QuickWall which allow questions to be asked and for people to be able to answer them. The first of these chapters builds the basic application. The next adds Authentication. Then JavaScript and Ajax support. Finally, a &amp;quot;catch-all&amp;quot; chapter that includes sprucing the application up with the TimeHelper, Pagination, and RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What didn't work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the downsides: this book needed a copy editor and badly. Grammar and punctuation mistakes make the book difficult to read and distracts from learning the framework. Code formatting also wasn't consistent with awkward line breaks, although, this was less of an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also felt that the book didn't go deep enough into many of the features within the framework, especially when it comes to the Form Helper&amp;mdash;which could and should have a chapter all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, CakePHP 1.2 is still a moving target and has changed since the writing of the book, so you'll need to freshen up your knowledge in a couple areas to make sure that your applications work okay on the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worthwhile?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall though, CakePHP Application Development does what it's supposed to: it provides a good introduction to CakePHP. If you've been developing with 1.2 for awhile, you probably won't find many surprises. This book will be great for anybody looking to get their feet wet with the framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
