As an alien, it&#8217;s a fascinating and at times alarming experience to observe the campaigns in action. Coming from England, my naturally liberal attitudes don&#8217;t make me overly compatible with being an independent over here, but my ineligibility to vote does.</p>

	<p>I studied the politics of the United States back in 2000&#8211;2001 for an A-Level course. It was just a twelve month study, but it provided an insight into the comparison with the politics back home in the UK. In the US, the cultural aversion to third parties and absolutes of a two party system make for quite blunt presentation. The impression painted is of a severely divided nation.</p>

	<p>Red republicans vs. blue democrats. Entire states &#8212; entire countries by European scales &#8212;&#160;grouped into supporting one single party or candidate.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a side affect of the allocation of electoral college votes; a system whereby the citizens of each state vote for the president, and the winning candidate in each state receives a number of votes based on population. It&#8217;s biased toward smaller states to try and protect them from being trampled by the larger ones. It deliberately distorts the popular vote to maintain a stronger union.</p>

	<p>So, for example, California has 55 electoral college votes, Texas 34, but comparatively tiny states like North Dakota still get 3.</p>

	<p>The electoral college itself is not a huge problem. The problem is with presentation. Consider this electoral map, which you can find as part of <span class="caps">MSNBC</span>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032553">Election Dashboard</a>.</p>

	<p><img src="/res/posts/election08/electoral.png" alt="" title="Projected vote for 2008 presidential candiates by state"></p>

	<p>The political leaning of each state is represented in terms of absolute victory. Not in terms of margin of victory. Solid blocks of colour show Democrat coasts, and red Republican centre. It shows a nation torn apart. It shows divide.</p>

	<p>Maps like this are terrifying. They represents an unreconcilable division of political parties who are, frankly, not ideologically far apart. They encourage casual observer to write off the detailed viewpoints of &#8216;blue states&#8217; or &#8216;red states&#8217;, simply because they don&#8217;t affect the vote.</p>

	<p>Really, these maps are a gross misrepresentation of the viewpoints of Americans. At an emotionally heated election time, when Republican political rallies become tinged by violence toward their countrymen, it strikes me that perhaps the incessant reinforcement of this map undermines the foundations of the American nationality, not just statistics.</p>

	<p>To get to my point. These maps exist to represent the allocation of electoral college votes. Electoral votes are allocated all or nothing &#8212; except for Maine and Nebraska, which uses a more proportionally representative Congressional District method. In response to the all-or-nothing allocation, solid blocks of blue represent safe Democrat seats, solid blocks of red safe Republican seats. It implies solid majority support, when really &#8216;safety&#8217; only means a majority of at least 10 points.</p>

	<p>Take Maine. The magnificent <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a> gives a hugely comprehensive breakdown of polling. Maine is a &#8216;safe&#8217; Democrat state. But really, it&#8217;s just a 55 to 43 split in favour of Barack Obama. And that&#8217;s with a &#177;5% margin of error.</p>

	<p>Summarising today&#8217;s FiveThirtyEight projections, the divide between Democrat and Republican voters are far less pronounced that the maps across the internet and television make out.</p>

	<p>FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s table is an image, bizarrely, so I&#8217;ve only copied out some of the stats. Hopefully enough to illustrate my point.</p>

	<p>The impression that the coasts are so dominated by democrats or that the centre states are dominated by republicans is false. <span class="caps">A 30</span> percent minority is far too large to be dismissed, and yet that is what the disproportional maps show.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;d like to redraw that map in different ways. Redraw colour intensity by actually percentages, rather than safety. Redraw each state showing both red and blue. I think it would provide a reassuring view of America. One of integrated political, rather than division. The perception of division appears widespread, and it is a falsehood.</p>

	<p>At the core of this? Huge numbers of American voters are disregarded both by the electoral system and the media presentation of the election.</p>

	<p>As a liberal minded type, is Texas write off of right-wing politics? No. In fact, 42% of the biggest red blog on the map poll for Democrats, and yet the small majority makes a massive impression on the perception of America&#8217;s make-up. The reverse is true in Calfornia. That huge hunk of blue that suggests the entire West Coats is a liberal haven? Also 40% Republican. Even Alaska, a state dismissed as neo-conservative due to its Sarah Palin connection in fact polls 41% Democrat. Those people are lost in these maps.</p>

	<p>This is not really about whether the electoral system is fair, it&#8217;s the negative social effect of representing it this way. American politics can do without any more negative social effects.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ben-ward.co.uk/feeder/?FeederAction=clicked&amp;feed=Articles+%28Atom%29&amp;seed=http%3A%2F%2Fben-ward.co.uk%2Fblog%2Fpractical-publishin%2F&amp;seed_title=Practical+Publishing"><![CDATA[	<p>Something that &#8216;people in San Francisco&#8217; seem to do, that no-one back home in London was doing (or if they were, they kept quiet about it) is maintain a personal wiki. I&#8217;ve avoided it for ages, mostly because I figured that if I have this much trouble maintaining a blog, surely a wiki will just make my cluster of unmaintained pages even larger.</p>

	<p>The previous entry on microblogging was the start of a realisation. Realising that Pownce is useful in its capacity as a microblogging platform rather than as an alternative to Twitter, I think that my personal publishing breaks down cleanly into tiers, based on the depth of the content. And a wiki is perhaps the most natural part of that as anything.</p>

	<p>Blogging, as in a site like this, is really only well suited to a certain style of publishing. I want to publish content of a consistent style on this blog. I want there to be a certain amount of depth to each entry, and I don&#8217;t want some detailed attempt all about the philosophy of personal publishing to be punctuated by a single line piece stating that &#8216;I could really murder a chip butty right now&#8217;.</p>

	<p>The way I see this breaking down, and this is starting to feel quite natural, is as follows:</p>

	<p><ul></p>
  <li><a href="http://pownce.com/benward" rel="me">Pownce</a> is for short things. Thoughts, spontaneous musings, links that you think are <em>remarkable</em> (which contrasts with Delicious, which is a store of links I think are <em>useful</em> in some way). It suits short, sharp content. No room for depth. That&#8217;s microblogging.</li>
  <li>This blog contains longer, more considered content. I feel reasonably sure that the things I write here are somehow valuable, either as information or as an expression of my self. They have some depth. Comments are on. I should track responses on other blogs, too. Whilst communicating via separate blogs is a lamentably lost ideal of the original, pre-comments design of blogging, it&#8217;s a concept I like. In aiming to write content of substance, I&#8217;d want to support it.</li><br />
</ul>

	<p>The critical thing with a blog though, and something that should be embraced, is time sensitivity. What I write here is timestamped and could, upon further reflection in a month or a year prove to be dismissible rambling bullshit. But the timestamp validates that. The moment you read this you know that it&#8217;s old and that gives you the context to consume it. You can write safe in the knowledge that time will let your obsolete content fade away. Timeless, accidental masterpieces will look after themselves.</p>

	<p>Which leads to wikis. A wiki will contain detailed content. Thoughts, projects, entire subjects documented through the eyes of an author. Wikis have long been complemented for being very close to the original ideals of the read/write web that Tim Berners-Lee envisioned (back before no-one  had bothered to implemented the necessary <span class="caps">HTTP</span> verbs to do it). It&#8217;s back to a world of writing standalone pages. And in standalone, I mean to imply <em>timeless</em>. So, my &#8216;about me&#8217; page isn&#8217;t a blog entry, it&#8217;s a page, and wiki is a superior publishing medium to maintain that kind of content. Similarly, documenting my &#8216;thoughts on personal publishing&#8217;, and my &#8216;current publishing practices&#8217; is a standalone, timeless (and constantly updated) piece of information. Here I blog about how I publish, or rather, how I&#8217;m considering doing it. It&#8217;s driven by a desire for discussion. However, to publish my current publishing behaviour, a wiki is a superior platform. That one <span class="caps">URL </span>(let&#8217;s say, perhaps, <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/content/Publishing">http://ben-ward.co.uk/content/Publishing</a>) will always represent current information and is far preferable over regular blog entries every time I change something. &#8216;Publishing Patterns, August 2008&#8217;, &#8216;Publishing Patterns, November 2008&#8217;&#8230; a blog is less suitable for versioned content.</p>

	<p><h2 class="flow">So, Twitter is a slight oddball</h2></p>

	<p>I regard it as publishing &#8216;fragments&#8217; of my day. By my reckoning it fits into the tier below (smaller than) &#8216;microblogging&#8217;. But it grew out from encouraging people to just publish their status and into its own social network. So as well as containing the little snippets of my day, it also contains pieces of social interaction. Twitter is great, but it&#8217;s a less pure publishing platform.</p>

	<p><h2>Combination. The lifestream.</h2></p>

	<p>The thing about blogging &#8212; an issue that produced some background resistance in me to the personal wiki concept &#8212; is that whilst you can better maintain content, you&#8217;re unable to push it to people. A blog has a feed and people consume that feed and therefore people read what you have to say. Sound vain? Get over that and accept that in some capacity we all want people to read what we write and we don&#8217;t want our output buried somewhere it&#8217;ll never be found.</p>

	<p>If I were to produce a nicely combined life stream (which I will), Pownce, Twitter and the blog are chronological and so slot in neatly. Twitter gets filtered to avoid publishing those &#8216;social interaction&#8217; posts, but otherwise fits in. But since wiki content is not time sensitive, it is not the content itself but the <em>edits of that content</em> which should be streamed. That in itself is a bit problematic. New pages are probably noteworthy, major edits are probably noteworthy; minor edits not so much.</p>

	<p>The scenario I&#8217;m trying to support is this: Rather than someone come to this site and subscribe to just the blog feed, they would subscribe to the whole lifestream. But, the lifestream would be built such that the content is relevant enough they don&#8217;t get irritated by its content. Not an easy balance. Configuration seems like a grossly over-complex solution, but perhaps offering two predefined options would be manageable; substantial content containing blog entries, major wiki edits, and longer Pownce posts could be available separately from the whole life stream.</p>

	<p>I suppose I should build it.</p>

I've switched from back tabbed to multiple windowed browsing on Mac OSX.]]></summary>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ben-ward.co.uk/feeder/?FeederAction=clicked&amp;feed=Articles+%28Atom%29&amp;seed=http%3A%2F%2Fben-ward.co.uk%2Fblog%2Ftabless-browsin%2F&amp;seed_title=Everything+Old+Is+New+Again.+Tabless+Browsing"><![CDATA[	<p>When Firefox was released, tabbed browsing suddenly became the new essential feature in web browsers. Internet Explorer was belittled for its old school multi-window interface and tabs were pimped as the greatest thing since sliced bread (toasted and generously smothered in butter).</p>

	<p>The curious thing about this is that really, tabs suck. They always existed as a simple hack around the operating system&#8217;s (Windows) inability to handle many windows together. The taskbar got full too easily, and when 75% of the items were browser windows, it all became unmanageable. As a result, tabs went into every browser on every platform, effectively providing a second, browser-context-specific taskbar.</p>

	<p>The problem now (and likely then as well) is that the idea of one single &#8216;browser context&#8217; is bogus. Browsers are now used for such a variety of tasks and applications that it makes less sense to keep, for example, Gmail and Google Calendar in the same context as a set of blogs you might be reading. Your cycle of looking at those pages is different. Mail more regularly than Calendar, and the blogs might just be a reading list to refer to later. Whilst browsers were very quick to add tabs as a feature, non of them have worked them into the idea of working contexts. New items always open in your last used window. Even if you manually break Gmail out into its own window, the moment you open a link you&#8217;re putting a reading list of pages into your email context. Tabs are implemented in a physical, window based manner, rather than in a workflow based manner.</p>

	<p>On Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span> specifically, there&#8217;s an addition problem (actually, physical). The otherwise quite-useful Expos&#233; function doesn&#8217;t work with tabs in any application. So whilst in Pages, Fireworks, Preview and so on I could hit <span class="caps">F10</span> and see all my documents together, the tabbed browser hides all the content away behind tabs.</p>

	<p>Which is a roundabout way of getting to a point. I&#8217;ve turned off tabbed browsing. Switched back to the old way of having each document or application in a separate window. Switching between then with <kbd>Cmd+`</kbd> rather than <kbd>Cmd+Shift+]</kbd>, gaining the ability to see them visually with a swift tap of <span class="caps">F10</span>, and losing the recurring bug of thinking I&#8217;m finished with all the documents in one manually created context window, only to find the music stops when I accidentally close Last.FM.</p>

	<p>To defy my muscle memory for hitting <kbd>Cmd+T</kbd>, I&#8217;ve used Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span>&#8217;s excellent Keyboard preferences to override &#8216;New Window&#8217; to <kbd>Cmd+T</kbd>, and New Tab to <kbd>Cmd+Option+T</kbd>.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s just an experiment. Sometimes you do want tabs to keep things under control, for example working through a feed reader, opening links for reference later creates a single &#8216;reading list&#8217; task, and you wouldn&#8217;t want dozens of those individual pages cluttering up the rest of the desktop. There will always be exceptions. But since the browser software has failed to handle work contexts properly, I think reversing the default behaviour is the way to go.</p>

	<p>Initial reactions are that this is easier to manage, results in less accidents and no accidents in losing windows (Safari has a &#8216;Reopen last closed window&#8217; option, but is less graceful with tabs).</p>

	<p>Note, this problem with tabs is just a result of needing to break web applications and documents out of the browser context. Efforts like Fluid (a WebKit based browser that creates standalone executables for specific websites) also help break out these contexts for apps you use regularly, but is less suitable for infrequent or new apps. Also, this is not to say that all tabs are broken. Tabs in IM apps like Adium still work me, because the amount of content open at one time is fairly small, and managing two work contexts (&#8216;Work Conversations&#8217; and &#8216;Personal Conversations&#8217;) within a single window interface is trivial. The web browser falls down because the amount of content and the number of contexts now exceeds what I can manage.</p>

	<p>We could build better browsers, but it strikes me that the better first action is to step back and stop bypassing the capabilities of the host operating system.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ben-ward.co.uk/feeder/?FeederAction=clicked&amp;feed=Articles+%28Atom%29&amp;seed=http%3A%2F%2Fben-ward.co.uk%2Fblog%2F28-days%2F&amp;seed_title=28+Days"><![CDATA[	<p>It is quite strange to think that I arrived in San Francisco a full lunar month ago. I&#8217;m in a disorienting &#8216;it feels like longer&#8217;/&#8216;it feels like yesterday&#8217; limbo.</p>

	<p>28 days ago was my first night in this temporary apartment. A neutral but very pleasant place to the south of North Beach with a quite stunning view of the bay, Alcatraz, and that Mediterranean looking tower that I forever forget the name of. Tonight is my last night here, tomorrow I shift over to my permanent new digs in the awesome (and very sunny) Mission district. It&#8217;s going to be a bit odd, what with having no furniture, but I&#8217;m really pleased with the location and the relief of having somewhere that I really like outweighs it all.</p>

	<p>Finding somewhere, and ordering the first wave of furniture has helped me focus on the rest of life a bit too. Everything went a bit wild when I landed. I ended up discarding the remaining blog drafts from my flight. They weren&#8217;t as complete as the others and I couldn&#8217;t make anything coherent from them. And then an iPhone upgrade accidentally wiped them out, just to be sure.</p>

	<p>At least one of those concerned the (ever lovely) Dot, who has moved in the opposite direction around the world, imposing a 9 hour time difference on us. Would we actually stay in touch? Would the time shift be surmountable? These and other generic ponderings have actually shaken out well. At this point we&#8217;ve established a pretty regular Skype routine going and I have to arrange shipment of a plushy companion cube one third the way around the globe.</p>

	<p>The biological family have got the hang of Skype too, which is keeping me in the loop much more than I&#8217;d expected.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m staring at a strange week of frantic furniture acquisition (I&#8217;m in the market for a dining table and chairs, if you&#8217;re interested), since the new apartment is totally empty. I&#8217;ll be sleeping on a mattress for a bit, since the bed frame won&#8217;t arrive instantly either. I intend to slum it, since I think living in the apartment will act as motivation to furnish it properly, whereas running off to a spare room elsewhere will likely prolong the whole process.</p>

	<p>I reserve the right to reverse that decision when it affects my sleep.</p>

	<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got some grasp of how long it takes for furniture to get delivered, I reckon we&#8217;re on for a housewarming in early October.</p>

Not much. When I do it&#8217;s in sporadic bursts between periods of being very busy and periods of being disinterested. That&#8217;s opposed to having some gloriously valuable essay is permanent percolation.</p>

	<p>That is not to say I don&#8217;t think of things, though, and in the interests of actually exposing them, I&#8217;m going to make better effort to post them in an oh-so-trend-although-actually-it&#8217;s-been-trendy-for-ages-now-I&#8217;m-just-late-to-the-party microblogging fashion. Two options are apparent. <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, which I&#8217;ve previously only used for secret emo outpouring during a frankly unpleasant time in my life, or <a href="http://pownce.com">Pownce</a>, which I&#8217;ve never quite nailed down the niche for. Tumblr is pretty, and flexible and maps to my own domain, so I&#8217;m trying that first: <a href="http://snippets.ben-ward.co.uk">snippets.ben-ward.co.uk</a> is alive (give or take a few hours for <span class="caps">DNS</span> propagation).</p>

	<p>Within a few minutes of setting it up though, I&#8217;m immediately wondering if Pownce, with its desktop and iPhone apps, support for images and Fire Eagle integration might be a better choice. I might switch over quite quickly.</p>

The mind settles down, you remember that the people back home are going to be fine and you return to your middle point; contemplative but with no bias toward sadness, happiness or otherwise.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m looking out the window at Oregan, flying over the flats between Mount Rainier and the Blue Mountains. Below me are circular fields&#8212;surely an inefficient use of farmland, but since there&#8217;s no shortage of land in this gigantic country, I guess the ease of ploughing, sowing and harvesting in a big spiral is appealing. We&#8217;re about 570 miles from San Francisco. (I&#8217;ve stopped watching films and have the flight info screen scrolling by instead&#8212;it took ages to write this paragraph as I waited for each map view to cone around twice for spelling confirmation.)</p>

	<p>I recall Tom warning me about these feelings. Something to the effect of having a good chunk of time where you feel like you&#8217;re making a terrible mistake.</p>

	<p>Just a semi-circular field this time. Pretty sure that&#8217;s not as clever.</p>

	<p>I wish I&#8217;d remembered him saying that earlier, when I was feeling it.</p>

	<p>Anyway, I know this is going to be awesome. Give it a week to sort out the remaining beurocratic nonsense and get my Twitter friends list up to scratch and it&#8217;ll be easy. Mum will figure out Skype, Dad won&#8217;t but will manage to obnoxiously act out in the background whilst Mum&#8217;s using it; communication in general won&#8217;t be much harder than at home.</p>

	<p>The idea that I live here is a bit unreal, though. In fact, that&#8217;s only just hinting at sinking in now. It just feels like I&#8217;m coming for a visit. I guess I&#8217;ll realise that I haven&#8217;t returned home at some point.</p>

	<p>Live blogging on the plane is very theraputic. Whilst being critical of and frustrated by Wordpress&#8217; internals is all too easy, the iPhone app is simply outstanding. As a publishing platform, very excellent.</p>

	<p>Less than an hour to go. Getting excited now.</p>

It&#8217;s one of those things that doesn&#8217;t happen too often, but when it does, comes as the starkest reminder that what&#8217;s going on is a really big deal.</p>

	<p>The effort of making this move, from London to San Francisco, is consuming. Especially this week as everything moves so fast, forms to be filled, a tenancy signed, a one-way flight booked. You don&#8217;t get much insight into how other people feel about your departure as you&#8217;d like. No matter how temporarily, they&#8217;re sad, upset and down. And it only comes out; it only connects, when you actually say goodbye.</p>

	<p>It hits you so hard. The coming together of the cold, hectic process of organising a life, and the raw love and emotions of the life you actually live in.</p>

	<p>3 hours into the flight we&#8217;re over Greenland. Snow covered and rocky, yet surprisingly flat. The total desolation of the place is making me desperately aware of how far away I&#8217;m going to be, and how much I&#8217;m going to miss my family.</p>

	<p>I know it&#8217;s going to be fine. I know I&#8217;m going to have an amazing time in San Francisco. But I&#8217;m back in reality, and I know there are things that will be really difficult, too.</p>

In the knowledge that I&#8217;d only be traveling from my home in Bethnal Green to Yahoo&#8217;s offices in Shaftesbury Avenue a few more times, I let the credit run down. Over the course of the next few days I&#8217;d pass through the gates of Bethnal Green and Tottenham Court Road and the card balance would tick down. An obscure countdown toward the single biggest change in my life so far. 2.40, it turns out, represents &#8216;zero&#8217;.</p>

	<p>On Monday I&#8217;ll be driven to Heathrow airport (Terminal 5) and fly direct to San Francisco. It&#8217;s a one-way trip. I&#8217;m leaving Yahoo! Europe to embark on a whole new adventure, switching over to our Brickhouse team, currently responsible for building <a href="http://fireeagle.com">Fire Eagle</a>.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s been a hard week. Whilst I&#8217;m uncontrollably excited about moving to the <abbr title="United States of America">US</a> and having an incredible adventure, this week has been full of abrupt good-byes. On Monday night I got an email. Kelly (a fantastic woman who&#8217;s been looking after all the details of my relocation) has found me somewhere to live in the San Francisco Bay Area, starting August 4th. Within an hour I had a flight booked and the next morning a van came to ship away most of my belongings.</p>

	<p>Sub Standards Ben was my last Pub Standards event in the UK. Surrounded by the best friends I&#8217;ve ever had, it was an absolute pleasure. Friday night we had some quiet drinks after work and then this morning I packed up the last of my belongings and said goodbye to David (Best. Flatmate. Ever. This year in our flat has been a joy.)</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s like the calm before a storm, perhaps. But it&#8217;s odd, being torn in two directions. If I&#8217;d not been given this incredible opportunity to move to San Francisco I know that I would carry on in London very happily having the time of my life. No matter how great San Francisco is, I&#8217;m really very sad to be leaving so many great people behind.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m a little sad and a little introspective, but fundamentally optimistic. Also a little lost for words, but that is perhaps clear from my rambling attempt to articulate it all. I&#8217;m just aware of needing to take a moment to breathe and pause before the rush of moving thousands of miles engulfs me. I&#8217;ve had wonderful experiences here and every one of them is worth thinking about. This year in London, with these friends, has made me.</p>

	<p>You know who you are. Thank you.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ben-ward.co.uk/feeder/?FeederAction=clicked&amp;feed=Articles+%28Atom%29&amp;seed=http%3A%2F%2Fben-ward.co.uk%2Fblog%2Flocation-location%2F&amp;seed_title=Location+Location"><![CDATA[	<p>So, my new job is working for Yahoo&#8217;s super-awesome Brickhouse team. I&#8217;ve moved out of Yahoo&#8217;s also-super-awesome European web development team, and in about three weeks time I&#8217;ll be moving to San Francisco.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s so much that needs to be said about moving, but for now I&#8217;m thinking a bit about <a href="http://fireeagle.com">Fire Eagle</a> itself, the gorgeous app I&#8217;m going to be working with for the foreseeable future. I&#8217;ve run sessions recently at Mashed 08 and then last week at Mobile Monday running through what we&#8217;re trying to achieve, and it&#8217;s quickly put me in a position of thinking about the field of location more generally.</p>

	<p>Location is big. The killer apps aren&#8217;t there yet, but looking at early reaction to iPhone apps, quick criticism comes to those which don&#8217;t use the CoreLocation <span class="caps">API</span> where it could be advantageous. There appears to be a gigantic side effect though: rash, unintended publication of location. Right at the heart of Fire Eagle, and the feature that I feel most passionately about, is control over disclosure. Reducing the level of detail exposed about your location, on a per-application basis. You can disclose your location based on how much you trust the application or website asking to use it, you can disclose to a level suitable to what you&#8217;ll find useful. Fundamentally, we want people to be empowered and to realise that they do not have to tell anyone who asks precisely where they are to benefit from location-based applications.</p>

	<p>Today, I saw this on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>:</p>

	<p><img src="/res/posts/LocationExposed.png" alt="A protected Twitter profile page, hiding all posts from me, but showing precise co-ordinates of the user's location"></p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve obscured the user&#8217;s details, but there are a number of key things I want to highlight, without going into much more analysis.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>This user chooses to keep their content protected</li>
		<li>This user is using Twitterrific for iPhone.</li>
		<li>The location is added by this app is not abstracted at all, it&#8217;s just a raw, precise co-ordinate.</li>
		<li>The location is disclosed to everyone visiting the page; not just the user&#8217;s friends. There&#8217;s no trust mechanism.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The iPhone only offers a &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; choice on whether to disclose your location to an app. There&#8217;s no local <span class="caps">API</span> to fuzzy that location when you work with it. Through the limited technology of the iPhone platform and the lack of thought on the part of a developer, that location has been made public in a way that it should not be.</p>

	<p>Your location is some of the most sensitive information about you. I very much believe it to be a more complex piece of information than an &#8216;OK/Cancel&#8217; prompt can handle effectively. I also fear that lazy attitudes toward location now, in these early days, could have a catastrophic effect on user perception of the entire location-application field.</p>

	<p>Raising this issue is not really about Fire Eagle, we just happen to have approached the problem very thoroughly. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you build an app using Fire Eagle&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span> or not. The crux of this matter is that you absolutely must encourage your user to trust you, else you will lose them.</p>

To celebrate the fact, and try to engineer the opportunity to see Everyone I&#8217;ve Ever Known one last time, I&#8217;m declaring the weekend of July 26th and 27th to be Ben&#8217;s Great Getaway Weekend. Two days of festivity that basically consists of meeting up in some pubs, oscillating between said pubs and a nearby park, eating, drinking, and having a good time.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve not picked the venue for Saturday yet, but it&#8217;s going to be a pub somewhere in very-central London. It should be easily accessible from the underground so people from far and wide should be able to find it without having to brave Zone 2. Sunday is going to be a more local affair at The Dove in Hackney, and probably include a lot more Belgian beer.</p>

	<p>Comedic self-hype aside, I would really, really love to see as many people I can before I leave. I don&#8217;t know how often I&#8217;ll be back on British soil, so this might be the last time for a while.</p>

	<p>Let me know if you can come by flagging yourself attending on one or both of the Upcoming events. Space on the beanbag/sofa/floor of my flat is available, if you ask nicely.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/896933">Ben&#8217;s Great Getaway Saturday</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/896938">Ben&#8217;s Great Getaway Sunday</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Leave comments to let me know roughly what time you&#8217;ll be in, and I&#8217;ll try to sort table reservations, too.</p>

A shame then that there's not a trace of web development best practice to found in this clusterfuck of a web app.]]></summary>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ben-ward.co.uk/feeder/?FeederAction=clicked&amp;feed=Articles+%28Atom%29&amp;seed=http%3A%2F%2Fben-ward.co.uk%2Fblog%2Fregarding-mecom%2F&amp;seed_title=Regarding+Me.com"><![CDATA[	<p><a href="http://me.com">Me.com</a> is Apple&#8217;s new replacement for .Mac. It&#8217;s very pretty. That it is implemented with a total disregard with modern web development techniques is as ignorable as any other failed web development effort, but the attitude toward their failure has rather ground my gears.</p>

	<p>Users of Internet Explorer 7 visiting Me.com are greeted with this message:</p>

	<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/2658069261/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2292/2658069261_c2df9e32c2.jpg?v=0" alt="Internet Explorer 7 has known compatibility issues with modern web standards which affect Web 2.0 applications such as MobileMe."></a><br />
<span class="credit">Screenshot by <cite>Chris Messina</cite></span></p>

	<p>I&#8217;m going to quote my comment from that Flickr screenshot, since, to be honest, it makes me angry:</p>

	<p><blockquote cite="http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/2658069261/"><p>What utter crap from Apple. A grand, holier-than-thou claim that IE&#8217;s failure to fully support web standards is the reason Apple discourage access to their new site.</p><p>A new site whose front page uses tables for layout, whose applications contain precisely <strong>no</strong> content in <span class="caps">HTML</span> and are entirely generated by JavaScript, a site which uses browser sniffing rather than progressive enhancement, fails to provide alt text on various images and suffers divitis littered with inline style attributes. A web site which redirects you to a faux 404 Not Found page if you have JavaScript disabled.</p><p>Even the fake 404 page, with a single column of content, uses tables and doesn&#8217;t validate.</p><p>Me.com has about as much in common with modern Web Standards as as a rhino and a quad bike.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p><q>Rhino and a quad bike</q> may in fact be a rather unfair analogy. You could, if you were so inclined, successfully hunt a rhino on a quad bike. You can hunt all you like, but won&#8217;t find a trace of web standards best practice on Me.com. To launch yet another <abbr title="piece of shit"><span class="caps">POS</span></abbr> address book and calendar service on the web is one (bad) thing, but to cite web standards in their anti-IE rhetoric is taking the piss and outright harmful to developers who use Web Standards to support building websites properly.</p>

	<p>Small Update: I&#8217;d like to emphasise that my anger here is entirely fuelled by the false attribution, the outright lie, that &#8216;web standards support&#8217; is the reason for Me.com blocking browsers. I&#8217;d not be so wound up just because the site is so badly built; the quality is just a bitter disappointment.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s an overview of distributed social networking in a <a href="http://microformats.org" title="">microformats</a> context, explaining how <span class="caps">XFN</span> and hCard gives us most of what we need to start exposing users to the benefits of having information made available between different social sites.</p>

	<p>As well as explaining how to go about publishing these things and explaining what the first iteration of consumption could be, I&#8217;ve also tried to emphasise how important it is to guide users into this interconnected world gently, since many won&#8217;t appreciate that their information is quite so public.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a little lengthy, but I hope it gets people thinking about the possibilities.</p>

	<p><blockquote href="https://welcome23.smile.co.uk/SmileWeb/getDomesticStatementPage.do?org.apache.struts.taglib.html.TOKEN=fb1f7f957eed5b489a12976d374171de&#38;pageNumber=122"><p>the browser&#8217;s navigation functions and keyboard shortcuts have been disabled for security reasons and because the internet banking service has been designed to be more accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Yes. Disabling the use of &#8216;Back&#8217;, &#8216;Forward&#8217; and &#8216;Refresh&#8217; is <em>obviously</em> going to make the site <em>more</em> accessible.</p>

	<p>Pathetic.</p>
