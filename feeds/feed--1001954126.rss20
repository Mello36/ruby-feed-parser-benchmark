 <description>Cool tools really work. A cool tool can be any book, gadget, software, video, map, hardware, material, or website that is tried and true. All reviews on this site are written by readers who have actually used the tool and others like it. Items can be either old or new as long as they are wonderful. We only post things we like and ignore the rest. Suggestions for tools much better than what is recommended here are always wanted.  Tell me what you love.

  <title>Skylite LED</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/skylite-led-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This light is designed for star gazing, but it is also a superb in-the-glove-box light since it provides red light for map reading or general fumbling around without disturbing a driver's night vision. You can switch to white light when you need it. Yes, the previously-reviewed Pilot's Light is much brighter with 20 white LED and six red, as opposed to the Skylite's two white, two red. So as an all-purpose light, the Pilot's Light might be a better option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's one feature the Skylite has that the &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003012.php"&gt;Pilot's Light&lt;/a&gt; doesn't: a rheostat wheel that lets you attenuate the brightness. Very useful in my case, since I use the light to get up early in the a.m. and walk to the meditation hall/temple. When entering a dark mediation hall at any time of day or night, the red light allows one to navigate to a seat without disturbing anyone else already seated. And I can also adjust the beam down further so as not to disturb them. My friends all use red lights as well, because our Spiritual Master instructed us that white light (as opposed to red) stimulates the pineal gland, and it's best not to do so first thing before meditation. Many of my friends use pinch lights, but I prefer the Skylite because it also provides the option of the adjustable white light when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light uses a 9v battery -- the upside is longer batter life, the downside is no rechargeable option. In addition, you do have to mind the rheostat wheel to make sure you don't leave the light on slightly. Nevertheless, this is one of my favorite and most used flashlights.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Nuvi 350</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/nuvi-350-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nuvi is a superbly designed car navigation device that is comparatively inexpensive. The Nuvi is a no-brainer to set up. You type the street address (it will guess the town) of where you want to go on the touch screen (or hit a place you've been before) and it shows you where you are on a driver-view map.  It indicates upcoming turns on the map visually and with a spoken voice. It's generally reliable anywhere in the US even in places you would not expect. When you alter course, it rapidly recalculates a new route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are pretty much standard features on car navigation systems. In addition to built-in nav systems in high-end cars, there are lots of manufactures and models for these small add-on units. I checked a lot of research and reviews, but the best advice came from taxi cab drivers I asked. They use these devices a lot and they have experience with different varieties of them. Their consensus was that the Garmin Nuvi was the best deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuvi 350 has a street price of $180. The wider screen and added features of the higher models are luxuries. Do you really need a nav device at all? Here's the thing: it is way better than either a map or directions in getting you to somewhere new. I never get lost now. Also, it does something a map or directions can't do, which is to find the nearest gas station or park, or ATM. A nav system is also way safer, too. I got one for my daughter at school in a new city; I am beloved and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheaper nav systems (such as the Nuvi 200 series) don't talk. The big surprise in car navigation is that you need turn-by-turn spoken instructions. That keeps your eyes on the road and minimizes looking at the map. The Magellen Maestro is a comparable product, slightly cheaper, but with less love from fans. As of now, the Garmin Nuvi 350 is the starter car nav device to get.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Strap Pod</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/strappod1.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Strap Pod isn't as steady as a monopod and nowhere near as steady as a heavy tripod or even a relatively light one like the previously-reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000122.php"&gt;Tiltall Tripod&lt;/a&gt;. But when you want to pack something small, stealthy, quiet, and effective....voila! I've been using one for more than two years for when I shoot in low light and available light -- which I do with some frequency (indoor sports, concerts, theater, etc.). The Strap Pod rolls up nicely, stashes easily in your pack, pocket or on your belt and -- unlike a tripod or a monopod -- it is very easy to deploy, use and remove quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm more inclined to bring it along when I don't necessarily have a 'set up' of shots in mind. If I go for an impromptu hike in the local woods as dusk approaches, for instance, my experience is that the Strap Pod seems to give me an additional one to two stops. This allows me to shoot without pushing the ISO too far, or shooting at too slow of a shutter speed as to blur any action. (Note: my 85mm prime lens is an f1.4 and my 70-200mm zoom is an f2.8 -- the fastest lenses that allow 'reach' under low or available light ). Even with Virtual Reduction of shake functions in higher end DSLRs (in the lenses for Nikon, in the camera for Canon), having just that much more stability in your shot can open possibilities for a bigger range of useful f-stops. You could accomplish this with a classic, previously-mentioned "&lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001436.php"&gt;chain pod&lt;/a&gt;," but if you're in the woods shooting wildlife, the jangling of a chain is hardly stealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that the Strap Pod is removed from a baseplate via a vice action -- not the screwing and unscrewing of a threaded bolt -- so it quickly and cleanly attaches/detaches. I have a camera worth more than the internal threading/tapped hole that accepts something like the chain pod. I'd rather not leave an eye bolt in my camera, because I often need to quickly shift from supported shot to free shot. If you are taking street shots in lower light, but don't want to traipse around with a monopod, you can keep the Strap Pod mounted on your camera. Just drop the strap, step into the loop and shoot. No muss, no fuss, no twisting or flicking sections or wielding something that looks like a baton or a spear. In the case of museums or some public spaces, tripods are simply not allowed (though you can sometimes get away with a monopod by pretending it is a 'walking stick'). But again, hauling a monopod around is sometimes clumsy, frowned upon, or outright discouraged in certain environs. The Strap Pod is much less intrusive and bulky, so I'm more likely to toss it into my pocket or my camera bag and bring it along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For serious support of camera and lens, I use a serious, lightweight, carbon-fiber monopod with a Kirk arca-mount plate, and a Gitzo Mountaineer model carbon fiber tripod with a Kirk ball head mount. I wouldn't count on the Strap Pod to replace monopods or tripods, especially in critical shoots like weddings or commercial photography. That's not the point. The Strap Pod is another tool for photographers to use to gain some helpful stability with their shots and maintain a more optimal ISO, while giving more options for creative control over f stop and shutter speed ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Greenspeed Trike</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/greenspeed.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although I've known about recumbents for years, until recently I had a prejudice against them. Whenever I observed middle-aged riders of two-wheeled recumbents (like the previously-reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002763.php"&gt;Cruzbike&lt;/a&gt;) obviously just getting started on regular daily exercise, they seemed unstable when starting to pedal from a dead stop. That led me to trying out a three-wheel tadpole trike, which allows you to remain in a stable, ready-to-ride position. After just two minutes riding a trike, I was addicted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greenspeed sits closer to the ground and is much lighter than most delta trikes -- my GT3 weighs 37.5 lbs compared to the 65 lbs. of the previously-reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001013.php"&gt;Sun USX&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike deltas, the tadpole provides a greater sense of the same freedom, speed and agility that people are used to on good upright bikes. My GT3 is much faster and infinitely more sporty and maneuverable than a delta. If deltas are sedans; tadpoles are the sport coupes. Sitting with one's head upright enables you to enjoy your surroundings much more than on regular cycles. This is true of all recumbents, but for me, there's something especially thrilling about a tadpole. Though all tadpoles whip around like human-powered go-carts, the Greenspeed has 16-inch wheels rather than 20-inch ones on most tadpoles. Thus, it has a much tighter turning radius and even more responsive steering. It's also really fun to move along at a good clip that close to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that if you're older and/or fairly overweight, the Greenspeed can be harder to get in and out of than other tadpoles (again, it's lower to the ground). However, I started riding my Greenspeed after four months of moderate walking and stretching and did fine with the GT3 even though I had real back problems and was overweight. Still, if you're concerned, &lt;a href="http://www.catrike.com/"&gt;Cattrike&lt;/a&gt; has a lower-price entry-level tadpole that is higher off the ground with 20 inch wheels and a more upright seat angle. Other than the entry/exit difference, though, tadpole trikes are extremely comfortable -- my GT3 is actually more comfortable than my Ergohuman office chair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenspeeds aren't the cheapest tadpoles. Sun now makes fairly inexpensive tadpoles and that entry-level Cattrike is a real deal. The new Greenspeed GT1 is more affordable than the GT3, but obviously the higher price brings with it better components and a noticeable difference in performance that I value.Since I bought mine used from a guy who was buying a more advanced custom model, I paid a very reasonable $1500. (note: the late great &lt;a href="http://sheldonbrown.org/greenspeed/"&gt;Sheldon Brown's review&lt;/a&gt; of his GT3, details of off-roading, and description of the "recumbent grin" are quite compelling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my 20's and early 30's I was an avid distance cyclist; indeed, one of the most life-affirming events in my life was touring cross country in 1978. That said, I always had discomfort in my neck, crotch and butt and developed some knee problems. Finally, in my late 30's I started to have back problems that became stenosis and sciatica. I had to quit cycling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I discovered bent rides and the GT3, I thought I'd never ride again. Like many people my age (I'm 54), I have battled my weight. Having a significant gut makes riding traditional bikes that are meant to be quick, not feasible. Since starting to ride my GT3, I've lost 30 lbs and have been able to make good progress on a new routine of sensible eating that suits my body and age better. The machine motivates me greatly. During the summer, I rode nearly every day, ten to thirty miles. I've joined a gym to continue conditioning through the Minnesota winter before I begin bike touring again next year.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Essentials of Living Aboard a Boat  *  Living Aboard</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/living-aboard-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The uber dream: to live aboard a boat. This book's job is to wise you up about the reality of that fantasy. It will equip you with essential facts for this grand adventure, or else it will graciously eliminate the notion from your head forever. In either case it deserves a medal. This kind of clarity and sound advice is in short supply. Marina bookstores overflow with practical memoirs by salty authors, few of them with a view wider than their own hulls. This one is based on the experience of many liveaboard practicioners in many styles, and is the most useful way to answer the persistent question: "What is really involved living full time on a boat?" To clarify: The Essentials of Living Aboard is concerned with life on a boat that spends the bulk of its time docked, and only cruises occasionally. Your neighborhood will be other boats instead of open water. It is not too much of an exaggeration to say this lifestyle is less about living  on a boat and more about living in a marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living Aboard Magazine, still printed on paper, is devoted to the concerns and needs of liveaboards.  It's a pretty cozy subculture, in part because the cost of mistakes on water are very expensive and possibly dangerous. Think of this as an old fashioned newsletter for liveaboard users; all material is generated by readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the Essentials book and proceed to the magazine if you are not dissuaded.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Down Low Glow</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/down-low-glow-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seeing the previously-reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003032.php"&gt;DiNotte lights&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of the Down Low Glow, a super-bright bicycle running light embedded in a shatterproof tube with reflective mylar coating. Both a safety device and a fashion accessory, the Down Low Glow is possibly the most fun safety light I've ever seen. Even the persistence-of-vision LED spoke lights we have on our tandem don't get as many appreciative comments. Having skater kids comment on how awesome my bike is as I ride past has been particularly fun. I've even had total strangers come up to me and say they saw me the other night on the road. The glow from these things makes you look huge. Cars definitely give me more passing room, and my wife feels better about my evening commute knowing that I'm highly visible from all directions, including the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system comes in single- or dual-tube configurations and in a variety of colors including street-legal amber, blue, red, pink and purple (mine is green). The rechargeable battery is good for at least three hours on a dual-tube system, more on a single-tube (they also sell an "&lt;a href="http://rockthebike.com/node/1595"&gt;All Nighter&lt;/a&gt;" battery that lasts 14 hours on a single-tube, 7 hours on a double-tube). Mounting the lights to your frame is very easy, and requires no tools. There's a plastic clip which straps to your down tube with adjustable rubber bands and retains the larger diameter glowing tube. The smaller tube is held to the chainstay with velcro straps and rubber spacers. The battery pack can be attached with a sturdy velcro strap to virtually any part of the frame, including the seat tube or top tube. However, I keep my battery in a &lt;a href="http://www.jandd.com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=FFP"&gt;Jandd frame pack&lt;/a&gt;, along with a multitool, spare tube, patch kit, &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000011.php"&gt;Adventure Medical&lt;/a&gt; Ultralight &amp; Watertight .9 first aid kit, keys, and cellphone -- i.e. it's not like I bought the bag just for the batteries. Keeping mine in the frame bag also helps protect the battery when it rains, which is a lot here in Seattle (note: I believe the newer generation of battery packs are more waterproof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until fairly recently, I was able to park my bike in my office, so I didn't have to worry about people trying to steal them while parked during the day. At night, I am never away from the bike for much longer than it takes to buy groceries, so I haven't been too worried about them then, either (I've been using them since Christmas of 2006 with no issues). Since I don't have secure bicycle parking at my new job, the use of a &lt;a href="http://www.rockthebike.com/node/1564"&gt;hose clamp&lt;/a&gt; looks like an excellent idea for preventing theft of the tubes. The battery pack removes quite easily, so it'd probably be a good idea to take it with you if you're worried.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Gardner Bender Romex Cable Ripper</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/gardner-bender-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The previously-reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003061.php"&gt;Cable Slitter&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of this little thngamawhoogy. My father, who made his living as an electrician, always had one on him for stripping cable. You slip it over the wire however far you want to cut it. The electrical cable passes through a hole in the wide end of the CR-100 (note: the holes running along the side are only for checking the gauge of the wire). Then, gripping the tool firmly, you just slide it toward the end of the wire, pulling the wire through and causing the cutting blade on the open end to slit the length of the sheathing, without damaging the wires inside. You can then pull the inner wires out and cut off the sheathing with a knife. Or in my father's case, the cutters on his pliers. This Cable Ripper and a pair of pliers was all he ever used (he could also strip wires with pliers, but that's really an acquired skill).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's virtually impossible to accidentally cut yourself with this tool, which makes it safer than trying to slit a cable with only a utility knife. I also find it's better than the strippers on a set of pliers, because it's specifically made to slit romex (NM or non-metallic) cable, not strip insulation off the wires themselves. Two drawbacks: it's intended for romex cable and really isn't too useful for anything else. Two, you need another tool to cut the sheathing off. Still, it's inexpensive, works great and you can get them at Lowe's,  Home Depot or any electrical supply place and probably your local hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Paddleboards</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/paddleboarding-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paddlboarding is a great way to stay in shape for surfing, to explore the coast, to watch birds, and to cruise around in almost any body of water. Paddleboards, like surfboards, snowboards, skateboards and other devices used for moving through space, have evolved greatly in recent years. For years, &lt;a href="http://www.eatonsurf.com/EatonPaddleboards.htm"&gt;Eaton&lt;/a&gt; paddleboards were the primary manufacturers of quality racing boards. Lately, Joe Bark has been turning out beautiful stock and custom boards. This summer I bought a slightly used Joe Bark 12' "Surftek" paddleboard in L.A. for $1,000 ("Surftek" is the nickname for lightweight surfboards/paddleboards built with Styrofoam and epoxy resin, rather than the more standard polyurethane foam and polyester resin). The board is feather light (22 lbs.) and lets me skim through the water like a water skeeter. Boards run from 12-19' or so. The 12-footers are the most popular partly because they are the easiest to transport and store. The longer boards are slightly faster in races (there are over 70 races a year in Southern California), but more cumbersome to deal with on land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*NOTE: There is also stand up paddleboarding (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_up_paddle_surfing"&gt;SUP&lt;/a&gt;), where you use a physical paddle to propel and steer your way through surf and to catch waves. Giant, heavy surfboards, those have a completely different design. The ones I review above are lie-down (or kneeling) boards, which you *cannot* stand on and are not intended for wave riding (though you can catch small waves). -- LK&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Zoom H2 Handy Recorder</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/H2_and_accessoires-web.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quality digital recorders have shrunk to the point where they fit *inside* a hi-fi microphone, like this Zoom model. You can hold the mic and the recorder in one hand. This very compact recorder/mic can capture music in the studio or in the field at surprising high audio quality in stereo. I am more interested in recording voice and sounds for radio, and flash-card-based units like this one are more than adequate for that purpose. I was guided to the Zoom by the audio geeks at &lt;a href="http://transom.org/tools/recording_interviewing/200711_zoom_h2/"&gt;Transom&lt;/a&gt;, an online hangout for radio journalists. They review the best gear for NPR reporters and the like. (This stuff changes quickly so check Transom's tool area for the latest recommendations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using the Zoom H2 because it was among the least expensive choices for a professional level digital sound recorder. It contains its own decent microphones (no fooling around with auxiliary plugs, boosters, adapters, etc.), it records on cheap flash cards, it has an earphone jack so you can monitor the actual feed, and it comes with a nifty removable handle so I can hold it in front of interviewees. It also comes with a short mini-stand for studio recording. The Zoom H2 gets good marks for the quality of the mic and stereo recording. The resulting edited files sound as crisp and full as anything you'll hear on radio or CD. And the street price for this microphone/recorder combo is about $180.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when $200 digital cameras were able to take a picture as rich and detailed as a professional 35mm camera? Recorders like the Zoom H2 have crossed a similar threshold for sound. For under $200 you can record music, voice, sound at a quality nearly undistinguishable (for 95% of uses) from anything a professional  model would do.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>BabyBjörn Bib</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/babybjorb-bib.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The humble bib, a highly functional item that (usually) keeps a baby's clothes from getting splattered with food, has been around a long time without too many major improvements. Until now. Bibs made of non-porous, moldable, resilient silicone are a real step forward. The key features of the one we have from BabyBjörn are its shape and washability. The bib projects outward and terminates in an upward scoop, which not only covers more of the lap, but also catches and collects most dropped food that would miss an ordinary bib. So food that falls in it needn't be wasted; it's easy to spoon food out of it and back into the baby's mouth. We used to have several cloth bibs in regular use, which we rinsed out after each use and hung to dry. We had one oilcloth bib that was better than the others in that it rinses off fairly easily and dries quickly. But the silicone bib has replaced them all, because it rinses off with supreme ease, has no seams to catch crud, and is dry almost immediately. Although a quick rinse is sufficient, clean freaks can also put it in the dishwasher. It attaches around the baby's neck easily and securely, with a fastener integral to the bib, of the same material. There's an ocean of cuteness in the world of baby gear, but dealing with an infant or a toddler is made more manageable by functionality, not  gear decorated with adorable pink butterflies. This bib really makes life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>SkyScout Personal Planetarium</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/skyscout-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SkySout is an interactive guide for exploring the heavens with or without a telescope. When you point it towards a certain spot in the sky, the built-in GPS receiver identifies a particular constellation and stars -- and you can then opt to hear an audio tour about the celestial items that have been identified. The SkyScout employs a database purported to hold 6,000 stars, 1,500 double &amp; variable stars, all 88 constellations, and 100 deep space objects (galaxies, nebulae, clusters, et. al.), which will be more than enough targets to keep me and my family engaged for quite sometime. If the millions upon millions of light years involved with observable objects in space were analogous to a city map, the SkyScout can get you within a couple of blocks of your exact destination (which is pretty darn good!). Though the unit can be used as a spotter for those wishing to leverage a telescope, thus far, we enjoy exploring the night sky sans scope so the whole family can participate and listen to the audio lessons without having to wrestle for viewing time. It's proven very wonderful for engaging my young children in something they've grown to enjoy and I hope they carry forward in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've now had ours for a few months and use it a minimum of once a week (mostly weekends, weather permitting). Mostly, we star gaze from our backyard in the &amp;#8216;burbs -- not a "dark-sky certified" area with a dramatic showing of stars hidden by the pollution of city lights. But that's the point:  there's so much to see, even in our own backyard! Our favorite function is the "tour" which lets us sit back and look upward while listening to a Top 20 list of objects identified as optimal for viewing based on the date, time, and location of our session. The audible lessons are really interesting and fun -- usually consisting of highlights and some esoterica of the object under observation. The kids really enjoyed the Summer Triangle stars and their corresponding Constellations. The SkyScout lesson for Vega (one of the points on the &amp;#8220;triangle&amp;#8221;) touched on the 1997 movie Contact, which I was then able to parlay into a deeper spiel about Carl Sagan. Another big hit was the tour of Sirius or the &amp;#8220;dog star&amp;#8221; in the constellation, Canis Majoris. Outside of their love for dogs, I perceived a &amp;#8220;wow moment&amp;#8221; when it was defined as a binary star system (and what that meant) instead of what looks like a single star residing up there. Another superlative moment was when I pulled out the SkyScout during the day and began orienteering through the constellations -- yep the stars are still &amp;#8220;up there&amp;#8221; even when the sun is shining!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another plus, at least for my family, is how the SkyScout does away with the basic math required in manual astronomical observing. In the days prior to GPS-led apparati that were brought to market in the ancient, early '90s, astro-purists with an interest in locating various objects from within the observable astronomical inventory would have to understand basic algebra as a gateway to leverage a coordinate system (celestrial, equatorial, ecliptical, galactic, etc.). These systems involved somewhat complex equations for mapping the motion of moving objects relative to the observer's location and time. Of course, for professionals and hobby-astronomers alike, the employed utility of analog star charts, celestrial maps, etc. have historically assisted observers by removing the need for a truly granular comprehension of the underlying coordinate system(s). However, a solid understanding of coordinates (latitude and longitude) remained as a mandate for productive viewing. Of course, this explanation doesn't touch on the foundational math involved with telescope composition and its impact upon utility -- apertures, focal lengths, f-number, etc. -- but because the SkyScout is a viewfinder for the naked eye (rather than a scope or complicated tool), my kids can really stay engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, the SkyScout is a little like the radio was at the beginning of the last century. My family can take a seat together (in this case, outside, actually as a reprieve from the TV!) and let the audio lessons on objects in the heavens drive their imaginations. There is something enticingly refreshing about leveraging your mind's eye while listening to the SkyScout versus always examining (or at least expecting) high-resolution digital images of all astronomical objects. The kids have taken to it naturally. Now, when the sun goes down, my young daughter is guaranteed to make at least one inquiry into whether we'll be taking out the SkyScout to "find a star."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: the physical manifestation of the product only has an audio port for the enclosed headphones. To get and keep my kids engaged, I use my iPhone accessory speakers so everyone can listen. Also, there are &lt;a href="http://www.celestron.com/c2/product.php?ProdID=532"&gt;expansion SD cards&lt;/a&gt; with more data/info/audio tours. I have not used them, but they do seem like a great add-on for later to spice things up, especially if you're pairing the SkyScout with a telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Palm Nailer</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/bostitch-ex-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A palm nailer is a magic hammer. Like a nail gun, you hook it up to an air compressor, but unlike a nail gun, it can be held in the palm of one hand. Its appearance doesn't make its usage obvious, but this air tool pounds in nail after nail without hurting my hand at all. Just place a nail exactly where you want it. Press the opening on the nailer over the nail, and BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! -- compressed air drives a little hammer head inside the sleeve to gently pound in the nail. It takes about 10+ taps to get a nail all the way in, but in under a second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew about palm nailers until my brother-in-law clued me in -- and he learned from a friend who is a carpenter. They're perfect for working with precise positioning, like if you are putting together something with the previously-reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000589.php"&gt;Simpson Strong-Tie connectors&lt;/a&gt;. I specifically bought mine to do the siding on a backyard shed with a fort for my kids. I just wish I'd known about it when I was doing the framing. I used a lot of Strong-tie connectors that required a whole lot of manual wrist-busting hammering of nails, because -- unlike the palm nailer -- a framing nailer just isn't accurate enough for the Strong-tie holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The palm nailer is a total joy to use. I love my air compressor and air tools (and have three nail guns already), but another plus is the palm nailer works with in any single nail, not just framing nail-gun feed nails. Also, the size of the palm nailer lets you get into places either a framing nailer or a manual hammer simply can't fit very well. I've only used a Bostitch-branded palm nailer that I picked up at Lowe's. It was like $80, so not what I'd call cheap, but it's made by a solid manufacturer and it's readily available online and if you're walking into a big box hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Boondock RVing</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/boondock-1-sm.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Components of an RV electrical system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of gumption you can liberate your RV from the leash of the RV parks. Run it untethered, off the grid. Camp in a wild place, or in a parking lot. Takes some advance planning, maybe some more gear, certainly a change of spirit. This book will help. While its technical specs are out of date by a few years, the general drift of the book's advice is right on. Like in anything else off the grid, there's much talk about batteries, inverters and cables.  There is not much here about mail forwarding, etc, which is best covered by hanging out on the forums at &lt;a href="http://www.rvnetwork.com/"&gt;Escapees&lt;/a&gt;, the watering hole website for full-time RVers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escapees is a membership club for full time RVers which offers a popular mail forwarding service. You can get your postal mail and packages forwarded in a hundred different ways and schedules.  Since it is based in Texas, your official residence can then be located in a state without income tax. Its 35,000 members are eager to share their knowledge of the RV life with newbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Workamper is a good online bookstore full of RV-related titles. Guides to: Finding work on the road, cooking, repairs, shopping guides for new rigs, directories of camp grounds, Rving in Mexico and Alaska, dealing with insurance, etc.. Also a book that lists what stores lie at each exit of the interstates!  Most of the published lore focuses on snowbirding, and RV parking, rather than boondocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Boondocking RVing is the best book about the logistics of long-term nomadic RVing.&lt;/p&gt;

The Complete Book of Boondock RVing&lt;br /&gt;
Bill Moeller&lt;br /&gt;
2007, 176 pages&lt;br /&gt;
$12&lt;br /&gt;
Available from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071490655/ref=nosim/kkorg-20"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the cost of staying in private campgrounds is increasing, going up by a dollar or more per night each year. We recently read an article in RVBusiness magazine, written by a campground spokesman, that stated the industry envisions campground prices will eventually reach a level of 50% the cost of a midlevel hotel or more. Consequently, if you would normally pay $100 a night for a hotel room, you would pay $50 a night in an RV park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;
Retail Stores and Restaurants&lt;br /&gt;
Retail and chain stores often have large, well-lit parking lots. We have camped at Fred Meyer, Kmart, and Wal-Mart stores (or Camp Wally as they are more commonly called). In fact, Wal-Mart carries an edition of the Rand McNally road atlas with an insert that lists all of the U.S. and Canadian Wal-Marts. other options might include discount warehouses, such as Sam's Club, or restaurants, such as Cracker Barrel and McDonald's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;
Casinos are excellent places for convenience camping. We don't know of any casinos that prohibit overnight camping, unless they have a commercial campground. Of course, they expect you to patronize the facilities, so at least eat in their restaurants, which often have excellent buffets at reasonable prices. ... With the profusion of casinos being built all over the country, they can make great overnight stops with good food and entertainment. Some casinos have regular RV parks, but still allow boondocking in certain areas of the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;img alt="boondock-3-sm.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/boondock-3-sm.jpg" width="350" height="208" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You can use flexible water tanks to transport water to the RV.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;br /&gt;
We have two catalytic heaters -- a small one (1,600 to 2,800 Btu), which is mounted on the wall, and a medium-sized one (3,200 to 6,000 Btu) we can move around as needed. We've kept warm in some below-freezing temperatures with the catalytic heaters as our only heat source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;img alt="boondock-4-sm.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/boondock-4-sm.jpg" width="349" height="270" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Our catalytic propane heater with the folding doors that we made to protect the cabinetry near it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;
There is a bit of controversy over whether 6-volt or 12-volt batteries are better in a battery bank. Two of the arguments for using 6-volt batteries are (1) there are fewer cables involved in series wiring, so there are fewer connection to corrode; and (2) in 12-volt parallel wiring, one of the batteries in a two-battery bank will receive most of the load and most of the charge, and therefore will fail faster than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first argument has some validity as there are fewer cables in series wiring, so there is less corrosion. The second argument is not necessarily true, if you wire the bank as shown above. if a battery goes bad in a 12-volt bank, you can just disconnect it and use the remaining one. You'll still be getting 12 volts. With a 6-volt bank, however, one bad battery means the loss of the whole two-battery bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;
Should you tilt your panels and follow the sun? ... We have seen rigs with their panels mounted on racks that allow them to swing around to track the sun. Frankly, this just seems like too much work to us, plus we don't really think it's necessary. Also, when panels are tilted up, they can be more easily damaged by the high winds that occur during the winter months, particularly in desert areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>GearWrench X-Beam</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/gearwrench.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These are not your standard combination wrenches. They literally put a twist in it. The working ends are offset from each other by 90 degrees, which makes for a great handle that reduces stress and increases leverage. Beyond its heft and balance, the design of this crescent wrench/box wrench ratchet is much more comfortable, especially for repetitive tasks. By twisting the axis, that non-working end now makes for a more natural handle that diffuses pressure into the palm and across the fingers. The shaft of the tool is also slightly longer than many combo wrenches (small increases in shaft length greatly increase torque, or conversely decrease force required to achieve required torque).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using this wrench for three months in near daily use. As a solar installer I use my gear heavily in adverse conditions: bolting solar modules to rooftops. When other installers tipped me off to this brand, I did some investigating. They are the only tools I have ever seen endorsed by the Arthritis Foundation. I figured that if they are good for arthritis sufferers, it has to be good for me, too. I was right.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Yankz Sure Lace System</title>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/yankz.jpg" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One day while being frustrated trying to install &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001058.php"&gt;Speed Laces&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of sneakers with tiny fabric eyelets instead of larger, metal-rimmed holes, I searched around and found Yankz. Elastic laces, Yankz don't require you to install external fittings/hardware to your eyelets. With Speed Laces, you have to attach separate housings which lock the lace in place at each eyelet. With Yankz, you're simply lacing them through like you would a normal pair of laces and then locking them in place. Putting them on a new pair of shoes takes only a few minutes:  begin threading them through from the top (ankle) down to the bottom (toe); lock the ends into the plastic clip that doubles as a loop holder for the excess length of lace that comes from the top of the shoe; adjust the loop with the slide lock and you're done. If the loop is long enough, hook it into the toe clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;img alt="yankz-2.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/yankz-2.jpg" width="247" height="249" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on my fourth pair, most recently for a pair of hiking boots. It's a little more complicated getting them set up on boots using only five or seven pairs of lace hooks/eyelets, but it's do-able, and the result is hiking boots that go on and off almost as easily as bedroom slippers. Since the laces are a bicomponent (elastic core, woven outer), once they're adjusted correctly they stay put, no need to pull them tight when putting the shoes on. Plus, the woven outer creates a lot of friction so the laces resist being pulled through the eyelets. It's worth noting that the elastic does not hold forever. After two years, when my running shoes were worn out and I removed the laces, I noticed my first pair of laces looked over-stretched, much like the elastic waistline of an old bathing suit. Point being, much like a pair of shoes, the laces don't last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$7.50 for solid colors (various available), $8 for reflective. Worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
