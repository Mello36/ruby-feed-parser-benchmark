AdSense for Domains allows publishers to place ads on domains that have not yet been developed yet, also known as parked domains.  Google said they would show &#8220;ads, links, and search results on the pages, and may add other useful information in the future,&#8221; on these pages.  You have to understand that AdSense for Domains, formerly known as Domain Park, is a product that has always been extremely controversial in the ad space market.  Since 2005 and likely before then, Danny Sullivan has called for major reform of the product, because it delivered poor quality traffic sparked huge controversy.  Not only that, we have reported lawsuit after lawsuit over the product and even with the reformed opt out feature, it still has resulted in more lawsuits.</li>

When I commented to Sundar Pichai, Product VP, that this had to be one of the fastest exits from beta for Google in recent memory he explained that &#8220;Google has a very traditional approach to our client software products,&#8221; meaning it accelerates the process of getting them to a general release.  </li>

Want To Speak?</a></strong><br/>Search Engine Land&#8217;s next Search Marketing Expo conference, SMX West 2009, comes to Santa Clara, California this Feb. 10-12. The agenda has now been posted. It has sessions of interest to search marketers of all levels, and I&#8217;ll be doing a longer post in the near future to cover everything in the program. But for now, a simple call out to those interested in speaking. Our pitch form is open! The form lists all sessions where we have openings.

Now, I am receiving reports that Google is testing enhancing those suggestions by showing URLs in the suggestions, in some cases.   For example, Sam at Oh! Nuts emailed me a screen shot of Google showing his URL in the Google Suggestions for when he typed in [oh nut], here is a screen capture:</li>

Forbes tells the story of ex-Yahoo bizdev guy Rob Bailey, who left the company in 2006, and is now an award-winning winemaker. While Big Business is laying people off left and right, Bailey&#8217;s wine operation has grown from two to eight employees. Also mentioned: ex-Yahoos Jennifer Dulski and Neil Budde, who now run Center&#8217;d and DailyMe, respectively. Sometimes the grass is greener&#8230;.we sure hope so. </li>

Blogs, news sites, and social sites like Twitter are filled today with live reports about what&#8217;s going on inside Yahoo&#8217;s offices. Here&#8217;s a rundown of what we&#8217;ve found. Silicon Alley Insider is posting updated comments from the now ex-Yahooers, who are describing the scene at various Yahoo offices around the country: </li>

This simple step can result in supplying you with great results in Yahoo! Local, Google Local, increased web references, and potential increased rankings in Google web search. Here is how it works:</li>

So let’s jump right in and talk about friction, how it causes people to abandon the conversion process, and what you can do to minimize it.</li>

Their favorite tactics include hiding in lower positions during off hours, and targeting markets that you cannot see. Who are these brand thieves? How do they take advantage of brand equity they don&#8217;t own? And perhaps most importantly, how can you protect your own brand from the shifty tactics used by these charlatans? Read on.</li>

YouTube, Facebook appear on many of the lists. Prior to releasing the full Zeitgeist for 2008, Google highlighted the fastest rising search terms of 2008, where Obama topped the list of U.S. based searches. Yet in the full wrap-up, Sarah Palin won out across the globe as the fastest rising search.  </li>

Google properties set a record in October with more than 100 million video viewers &#8212; 99.5 million of whom watched videos on YouTube. Those are some of the numbers issued this afternoon by comScore from its Video Metrix service. Google&#8217;s video market share represents more than two-thirds of the estimated online video watching audience for the month. As the chart below shows, Fox Interactive and Yahoo ranked second and third, respectively, in audience share. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-book-search-puts-magazines-online-15762.php" title="Google Book Search Puts Magazines Online">Google Book Search Puts Magazines Online</a></strong><br/>First Google digitized books, then  newspapers, then historic  Time-Life photos and now &#8212; magazines. Today through Google Book Search, people can search  the full-text of millions of articles from more than 10 magazine with hundreds  more to come, the company has announced. Eventually, content from the magazines will be available to those doing Google News Archive searches or  show up in &#8220;regular&#8221; Google searches via Universal  Search. For now, however, the content lives only within Google Book  Search. How do you access the magazines? Ideally, Google wants you to find them in  response to a search for anything at Google Book Search. For example, a search  for hank  aaron catching babe ruth should bring up a listing tagged as &#8220;Magazine&#8221; that  leads to a 1973  Ebony magazine article about Aaron nearing Ruth&#8217;s home run record (note, search functionality doesn&#8217;t seem to be live yet but should be enabled shortly). </li>

It&#8217;s merely speculation at this point but Sarin is attractive for several reasons: </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/seomozs-new-toolbar-linkscape-doubles-in-size-15760.php" title="SEOMoz&#8217;s New Toolbar &#038; Linkscape Doubles In Size">SEOMoz&#8217;s New Toolbar &#038; Linkscape Doubles In Size</a></strong><br/>SEOMoz has announced they have released a new SEO toolbar and they have doubled the size of Linkscape.</li>

The New York Times reports, however, that neither Google nor Yahoo are ready to go along with the request. Microsoft attorney John Vassallo says the company won&#8217;t change its policy alone. &#8220;We support the commissioners&#8217; recommendations but are asking them to ensure these are uniformly observed,&#8221; Vassallo tells the Times. &#8220;Otherwise, to do so unilaterally would put us at a disadvantage.&#8221; </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-ads-for-hard-alcohol-and-liqueurs-now-allowed-15756.php" title="Google Ads For Hard Alcohol &#038; Liqueurs Now Allowed">Google Ads For Hard Alcohol &#038; Liqueurs Now Allowed</a></strong><br/>The Google AdWords blog just announced they are now allowing search ads for hard alcohol and liqueurs.  Just a couple months ago, they allowed beer ads and now they have expanded this to hard liqueurs in the US.  Why did they change this?  They said based on &#8220;advertiser feedback we&#8217;ve received over the years.&#8221;  But if you ask me, it is more about generating more revenue from their search ads, especially these hard times. The company has done a string of rollouts related to showing more ads, as our Drill, Baby, Drill: Google Finance Gets Ads; Google News Testing Them covers.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/yahoo-boss-now-serving-100-queries-per-second-15753.php" title="Yahoo BOSS Now Serving 100 Queries Per Second">Yahoo BOSS Now Serving 100 Queries Per Second</a></strong><br/>The Yahoo Search Blog announced that BOSS, Yahoo&#8217;s build your own search service, is now serving 10 million queries per day.  That is about 100 queries per second and according to Yahoo, who cites comScore, that is just behind Ask.com&#8217;s search volume. Note, these queries do not count as part of Yahoo&#8217;s search network, because they are technically served at third party web sites.</li>

Can it someday replace your doctor? Questions like this aren&#8217;t new, but the discussion has gotten a bit louder in recent weeks.  Just a couple weeks ago, I reported on a Microsoft investigation of cyberchondria, when inaccurate medical information online makes actual health problems worse. On Friday, Dilbert cartoon creator Scott Adams shared a different point of view, telling blog readers how Google helped him find treatment for a speech defect known as Spasmodic Dysphonia.  </li>

So, it&#8217;s important to separate the fact from the fiction about what affects landing page quality score, and to understand what you can do to improve your landing page.</li>

Advertisers can now create separate campaigns that are targeted specifically toward mobile searchers with smart phones. You can write mobile-specific ads and get performance data separate from your other AdWords campaigns. </li>

Here is a picture of the ad:</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/live-cashback-users-feel-cheated-by-microsoft-15749.php" title="Live Cashback Users Feel Cheated By Microsoft">Live Cashback Users Feel Cheated By Microsoft</a></strong><br/>On Black Friday, Microsoft&#8217;s Live Search Cashback program went black, in short, the service went down and many shoppers were unable to use the great deals they provided with their merchants.  Back then, Microsoft promised to make things right. Microsoft&#8217;s Live Search Blog posted an update explaining that they have been communicating with those customers who had issues and is sad to say, they will not be able to rerun the HP deal, where you can get 40% back on those purchases.  Microsoft said, &#8220;while we were hoping to be able to do that, we are sorry to report that it will not be restarted.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/bounce-rate-as-a-ranking-factor-15643.php" title="Do Search Engines Use Bounce Rate As A Ranking Factor?">Do Search Engines Use Bounce Rate As A Ranking Factor?</a></strong><br/> Your web site&#8217;s bounce rate may be a significant factor in your search engine rankings.  If the bounce rate on your site is high, you could end up with lower rankings in the search engines.  Correspondingly, lower bounce rates may actually offer meaningful ranking boosts. (Don&#8217;t know what a bounce rate is? Hang on&mdash;definitions below.) Don&#8217;t believe that bounce rate is a serious ranking factor?  You should.  A new study by SEO Black Hat shows some significant impact in a web site&#8217;s rankings as a result of significant changes in bounce rate.  It is, of course, possible that the data in the study have been affected by other factors taking place at the same time, so this one study is not be any means conclusive. I speculated on bounce rate as a ranking factor back in August of 2007. The underlying fact is that search engines want quality sites in their search results.  High bounce rates may be a very good indicator of a poor site experience, or worse still, a complete mismatch between the content of the site, and the search query entered by the user.  This provides heavy motivation to look at bounce rates as a meaningful SEO factor, and how to minimize bounce rates in the hope of increasing your rankings.</li>

Perhaps to get that ball rolling again, though, Ballmer says a deal &#8220;would probably be better for both us, and certainly for Yahoo, if we were to do it sooner than later.&#8221; He also reiterated that Microsoft can compete with Google without it, but outlined what he sees as the benefits of a deal with Yahoo: </li>

<li><strong><a title="Why User Experience Is A Crucial Part Of Good SEO" href="http://searchengineland.com/user-experience-seo-15638.php">Why User Experience Is A Crucial Part Of Good SEO</a></strong>
Have you ever heard a search engine optimization (SEO) professional use the term user experience during a presentation, in an article or as part of a sales pitch? On the web, user experience (commonly abbreviated as UX or UE) is a term used to describe the overall perception, experience, and satisfaction that users have as a result of their interactions with a website. Search engine optimization is all about the user experience, because the idea behind SEO is to get users to their desired information and destination(s) as quickly and easily as possible by using the users&#8217; language (keywords). Searchers type in keywords at a commercial web search engine. Searchers&#8217; expectations are validated in search results pages and, hopefully, after they click on links within those search results&#8230;a perfect, seamless user experience.  On the surface, an SEO professional&#8217;s presumed knowledge of user experience might sound impressive. However, if you do a little digging, you might discover that search professionals have their own preconceived notions as to what constitutes a positive user experience, notions that have little or nothing to do with users at all.</li>

Fearing a protracted legal battle, damage to its reputation/brand and perhaps even to its stock price, Google abruptly pulled out of the proposed Yahoo paid search deal. It was revealed at the time that the US Justice Department was planning to file an action against the deal. Now in an interview in AmLaw Daily, the attorney spearheading the potential case against Google, Sanford Litvack discusses what happened.</li>

Yesterday, Google Reader team announced that they have released a cleaner and fresher look to Google Reader.  The change incorporates a less blueish color scheme and a more whitish scheme.  Google has consolidated some of the features, added collapsible navigational links on the left and rounded some of the corners. But to my surprise, the whitish color scheme is not just available on the main Google Reader, it has been ported to the iPhone version.</li>

The Google Webmaster team announced three main things at their blog over the past day or so.  The first we covered, was the new Google help discussions area.  The second was adding a new settings link in webmaster tools to consolidate some features.  The third item is enhancements to controlling your crawl rate.

Jeremiah Andrick from the Microsoft Live Search team has written a detailed blog post named Getting the right kind of links.  In this blog post, Jeremiah explains the issues Microsoft sees with link exchanges and then gives tips on how to get &#8220;the right kind of links.&#8221; Those tips include to be the &#8220;subject matter expert&#8221; in your field, give stuff away as a &#8220;free service,&#8221; work closely with &#8220;industry or professional associations&#8221; to get links from their pages, and leverage Social Media.

Today, Google relaunched several of their help forums, moving them from Google Groups to a new help-specific platform. The English and Polish Google Webmaster Help group have made the move to this new format, with the other languages soon to follow.  Below, more details about how this change will benefit site owners and a bit of history about the start and evolution of the Google Webmaster Help group.</li>

Photo search took a couple steps forward today with announcements from both Yahoo and Google. The news from Yahoo is a mobile makeover of its Flickr photo sharing site, while Google announced a variety of improvements to its Picasa photo service. Here&#8217;s a look at the two announcements:</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-blog-search-now-with-full-text-post-indexing-15722.php" title="Google Blog Search: Now With Full-Text Post Indexing">Google Blog Search: Now With Full-Text Post Indexing</a></strong><br/> It&#8217;s been about two months since Google Blog Search was relaunched with a new  front page that summarizes stories. I talked with Google more about some of  the inner workings at the end of October and finally am getting around to posting this, spurred by one of the planned changes becoming official. Google Blog  Search now uses the full-text of posts (in most cases), rather than using  whatever was in a blog&#8217;s feed (which could often be only part of a post). </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/2008-video-search-year-in-review-15613.php" title="2008 Video Search Year In Review">2008 Video Search Year In Review</a></strong><br/> 2008 has had a number of notable milestones in the arena of video search. Here are six landmark events that that have particularly stood out, demonstrating that video search has finally &#8220;arrived&#8221; as a crucial area for search marketers:</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/search-biz-7-15719.php" title="Search Biz: Yahoo Wants A New CEO, And Fast; Qi Lu To MSFT; DOJ Was This Close To Suing Google">Search Biz: Yahoo Wants A New CEO, And Fast; Qi Lu To MSFT; DOJ Was This Close To Suing Google</a></strong><br/>Will Yahoo have a new CEO by the end of the month? That&#8217;s the word from sources talking to AllThingsD today. The report says Yahoo has put together an informal search committee to help executive search firm Heidrick &#038; Struggles find a new CEO. There&#8217;s reportedly a list of six criteria the new Yahoo CEO should meet. And throwing more confusion into the mix is the ongoing talks about a merger/sale with AOL, and the internal uncertainty whether that&#8217;s the right way forward for Yahoo. As AllThingsD points out, this might be too much to sort out within the next four weeks.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/why-usability-and-seo-go-hand-in-hand-15651.php" title="Why Usability and SEO Go Hand-in-hand">Why Usability and SEO Go Hand-in-hand</a></strong><br/> Many years ago, when Danny Sullivan was still part of Search Engine Watch and the Search Engine strategies conferences, a few of us approached him on having a session on usability. Surprisingly, he dismissed the suggestion saying that while usability was a great topic, it wasn&#8217;t really a search marketing issue.Thankfully, Danny did eventually see the connection between SEO and usability as evidenced by SMX East and West sessions covering the topic. There have been numerous articles by Shari Thurow, Kim Krause Berg and others here at Search Engine Land that provide lots of usability details. I&#8217;m not well-versed in all aspects of usability like Shari and Kim are, but I have understood how much it is intertwined with organic SEO for a long time. I&#8217;ve believed in the connection so strongly that I&#8217;ve been providing our SEO clients with Kim&#8217;s usability reports since 2004. They always add value as well as corroborate the SEO recommendations we make.</li>

Now, if you search at Yahoo for google, live or ask.com, Yahoo will tell you, &#8220;You could go to [Search Engine Name Goes Here]. Or you could stay here and get straight to your answers.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/has-microsoft-live-search-detected-malware-on-your-site-15712.php" title="Has Microsoft Live Search Detected Malware On Your Site?">Has Microsoft Live Search Detected Malware On Your Site?</a></strong><br/>Recently, Microsoft Live Search added malware warnings to their search results. If a searcher clicks a result that Microsoft has detected contains malware, a popup warns then not to proceed to the site. As Matt noted yesterday,  Google and Yahoo! also provide malware warnings to searchers. How can you find out if Microsoft has flagged your site for malware and how can you let them know you&#8217;ve fixed the problem? As part of this update, Microsoft Live Search also launched an update to their Webmaster Center that added alerts about malware. You can generate a report of all pages on your site that have malware on them, see if you link to any external pages that contain malware, and submit a review request once you&#8217;ve fixed any issues.</li>

The spirit of giving can lead to:	links to your website	higher search engine      rankings	positive associations for      your company	and most importantly, more      business!</li>

My main issue back then was that the embed options did not give people a way to embed the wide screen format, easily.  That has changed. YouTube now allows you to embed a wide screen format and they also added a search box at the top of those embedded videos.   In addition, Google added a search box to the top of the search frame of an image search.  Let me explain this below.</li>

One way to gauge interest in your company&#8217;s brand is to analyze keyword search patterns.  Your analytics team may gain valuable insight by monitoring changes in search patterns for your company&#8217;s brand.  </li>

The thrust of the WSJ story is that Google is trying to cut costs and reduce spending, which means getting rid of contractors, curtailing 20 percent time projects, shuttering services without traction (e.g., Lively, Google Page Creator) and reducing perks.  </li>

Celebrity news, captivating headlines and pop culture continued to captivate the online audience; emerging mobile devices bumped activity for social apps like MySpace and Facebook, as well as sharing videos downloaded via apps for the iPhone. </li>

In doing so, Live Search joins Google and Yahoo in taking a proactive stance against potentially dangerous sites; Google began adding malware warnings in early 2007. Yahoo added SearchScan alerts in May of this year. The Live Search implementation is different from how the other two search engines show malware warnings. When a potentially harmful page shows up in the Live Search results, users see no warning until they actually try to click on the link. When they do click, a small &#8220;pop-up&#8221; box appears to the far right of the listing. Here&#8217;s what it says: </li>

The company&#8217;s underlying technology is called &#8220;pattern proximity matching,&#8221; which seeks to better understand pages and context through numerous points of relevance. Company CEO  Philipp Pieper says that it can be used to match ads with content (or content with other content) but that it also offers a superior relevance algorithm for consumer search. However the new iPhone App &#8220;Proximic Agents&#8221; isn&#8217;t yet a full-blown search engine; it&#8217;s a more intelligent news reader &#8212; for now.  </li>

Celebrity news, captivating headlines and pop culture continued to captivate the online audience; mobile devices bumped activity for social apps like MySpace, AIM, MocoSpace and Facebook, as well as sharing videos downloaded via apps for the iPhone.The political landscape, and most notably, president-elect Barack Obama top the newsmakers lists, and politicians infiltrated 7 of the Top 10 slots in this category.Top names in the news in 2008	Barack Obama	Sarah &#8230;</li>

(You expected otherwise?) At AllThingsD, Kara Swisher was pretty adamant Monday that Yahoo and Microsoft are not in secret talks right now about a new search partnership, and she called the weekend report from The Times (UK) &#8220;inaccurate.&#8221; Part of that UK story had Ross Levinson and Jon Miller taking over the new company, but Levinson told AllThingsD the story was &#8220;total fiction.&#8221;Then, of course, a big soap-operatic (is that a word?) twist today, as Barry Schwartz recapped a Wall Street Journal report saying Jon Miller is trying to raise money to buy Yahoo. Join us tomorrow (or maybe Thursday, but probably no later than Friday) for another installment of As The Search Engines Turn.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/link-building-in-a-global-economy-15501.php" title="Link Building In A Global Economy">Link Building In A Global Economy</a></strong><br/>Global link building sounds very glamourous, like something you&#8217;d do wearing Chanel and drinking seriously good wine that I wouldn&#8217;t know anything about, not being the glamourous sort. However, it&#8217;s something that makes you roll up your French-cuffed sleeves and do some major dirty work. While the basics remain the same (get quality links, write good content, do your usual on-page SEO), there are a few extras to consider that should enable you to live in the middle of nowhere and successfully help clients all over the world.Let me first clarify what I mean by global link building. I am speaking about working with clients in a variety of countries and/or in languages other than your native one(s). My agency works with clients in the US, Canada, Australia, Spain, the UK, and Germany currently, and about 50% of our leads come from clients outside of the US, where we&#8217;re based. As we&#8217;ve seen with the recent financial crises both domestic and abroad, it&#8217;s obvious that our economy truly is quite global, and many people are quickly realizing that their marketing help does not have to come from less than five miles away.With that in mind, there are many ways that you can successfully conduct quality link building campaigns for clients in any part of the world. Here are a few to get you started&#8230;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/report-former-aol-ceo-miller-raising-funds-to-buy-yahoo-15675.php" title="Report: Former AOL CEO, Miller, Raising Funds To Buy Yahoo">Report: Former AOL CEO, Miller, Raising Funds To Buy Yahoo</a></strong><br/>Former AOL Chief Seeks Funds for Yahoo Deal from the Wall Street Journal reports Jonathan Miller, ex-AOL CEO, is trying to put together enough money to buy Yahoo.Miller is reportedly looking to raise raising about $28 billion to $30 billion, equivalent to $20 to $22 per share, to buy all of Yahoo.  The Wall Street Journal said that their sources are skeptical that Miller will be successful in raising the necessary capital to make this purchase.  In addition, many lenders are not only not lending, but they also find Yahoo to be a risky bet, according to the report.</li>

Tell us something we don&#8217;t already know!  Turning a few more pages I see, &#8220;As site traffic slows, online marketers tighten their holiday budgets.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I calmly fold-up my recent copy of Advertising Age and call my dentist to schedule that long avoided Novocain-free root canal!  I mean really, all this doom and gloom is probably enough to send some folks home early for the holidays to hang out with the relatives they have successfully avoided all year long.  But I&#8217;m an opportunist, so the timing couldn&#8217;t be better! There has to be an opportunity here, right?  We&#8217;ve heard a lot of noise in the trades about the fall of online display advertising in favor of performance-based advertising.  The good news is that lower budgets and fewer advertisers can actually mean less competition.  For smart local advertisers and their agencies, that is something to cheer about!  Literally it means more business leads for less money and a higher return on investment, if campaigns are executed properly.</li>

Much of it concerns Yahoo and Google, as it often does in this column. The big buzz generated over the weekend was from the UK&#8217;s Times Online report that there was a tentative deal reached between Yahoo and Microsoft to buy the former&#8217;s search business for $20 billion.  </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/live-search-launches-instant-cashback-for-ebay-purchases-15658.php" title="Live Search Launches Instant Cashback For eBay Purchases">Live Search Launches Instant Cashback For eBay Purchases</a></strong><br/>Microsoft just announced Live Search instant cashback rewards.  This instant reward currently only applies to items purchased at eBay.  If you make a purchase at eBay, using Live Search Cashback, you should see the rewards instantly in your PayPal account.  Yes, you won&#8217;t have to wait 60 days to see the money.   Clearly, having instant cashback rewards with all their partners is something we would love to see.  But for now, having eBay give you instant cash back is really nice to have.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/microsofts-live-search-cashback-goes-dark-on-black-friday-15656.php" title="Microsoft&#8217;s Live Search Cashback Goes Dark On Black Friday">Microsoft&#8217;s Live Search Cashback Goes Dark On Black Friday</a></strong><br/>Microsoft&#8217;s Live Search Cashback program was reportedly down much of the day on Black Friday.  This caused major concerns for customers who were excited to get large discounts on the day.  In addition, TechFlash reports many customers purchased items from HP, expecting to receive 40% cash back rewards from Microsoft, only to see 3% show up after purchasing. Between Microsoft&#8217;s Cashback having major uptime issue and not giving the rewards expected, Black Friday turned out to be a big bust for the program.  </li>

This is particularly true with long-sales-cycle campaigns, high touch lead generation campaigns, and campaigns that are designed to drive phone sales. Often, such campaigns track the cost of a lead or another metric that doesn&#8217;t necessarily tie them back to actual sales figures to get a sense of true conversions. This poses a problem in that uneven lead quality can lead to poor decisions in bidding, keyword selection, and so on. In this article, I will discuss several ways companies can effectively attribute sales (or close the loop) in lead generation and phone sales campaigns.</li>

Rankings are certainly one tangible way to measure SEO’s success, but at Agency.com we are working to move clients away from focusing on rankings and towards focusing on positive results that can be more accurately measured. In today’s search environment, placement is completely dynamic and state-dependent. Everyone is looking at different data centers for starters. Add in search history, geotargeted results based on IP and universal search, and then compound that with Google’s SearchWiki, and pretty much everyone is going to get measurably different results when looking for the same terms.</li>

I am now seeing reports that Google is going towards a text ad format. Michael Gray noticed, as did the folks at AccuraCast.com that Google is now placing three text ads in Google Image Search.  In the past, Google placed one image or banner ad in the image search results, either at the top or at the bottom.</li>

Last year, close to 900 respondents answered the SEMPO survey, and the results always paint a fascinating portrait of our industry.

According to the Guardian, this has resulted in Baidu&#8217;s ad revenue dropping ten to fifteen percent, plus the release of several ad representatives who have allegedly helped these false medical practices gain top ranking in Baidu.</li>

COME HERE AND LOOK AT MY WEBSITE! ISN’T IT GREAT?”  Or, when you submit your web site to forums for web site reviews, what do you typically ask for? You may write, “Tell me what you think of my web site” or “Which color do you like better, blue or red?” or “Did I optimize for search engines properly?” The worst mistake you will make as a web site owner is to ask someone to “look” at your web site.  It’s like the dreaded, “Do I look fat?” question. There’s never a safe answer.  For starters, someone may look slim standing up, but resemble the Buddha when sitting on a couch. You need to assign tasks to get honest answers to these tough questions. To understand if your web site is meeting its usability requirements, ask people to take it for a spin and try it out&mdash;and more specifically, to see if they can answer the following questions:</li>

Since SEO is a highly-efficient marketing channel with longer-lasting  results than most mediums, establishing ROI is challenging yet critical. Here are a few  suggestions on how to best integrate web analytics data with other tools to prove the value of SEO. Web analytics data is the foundation The cornerstone of any successful SEO program is accurate web analytics data. Don&#8217;t have an analytics package? Google Analytics is a  great free option that provides most of the  data points you need for SEO measurement. The information derived from your analytics tool is instrumental in determining the success of your optimization program - and this data can also reveal critical areas for future improvement.</li>

<p><span id="more-15632"></span> <strong>From Search Engine Land:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/searchbiz-4-15631.php" title="SearchBiz: MSFT&#8217;s Online Struggles; More on Yahoo-AOL; Cuts At Technorati">SearchBiz: MSFT&#8217;s Online Struggles; More on Yahoo-AOL; Cuts At Technorati</a></strong><br/>Fortune magazine asks why Microsoft can&#8217;t make money online, and shares some striking numbers: The company&#8217;s Online Services unit, which includes Live Search, aQuantive, and the MSN portal, lost $480 million in the quarter that ended September 30th &#8212; 80% more than the same quarter a year ago. Ouch!  Why the struggles? The article suggests that Microsoft is trying to do too much online, and that, by being so late to the search game, it&#8217;s playing an impossible game of catch-up to Google: </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/crappy-mp3-sites-comment-spamming-enough-already-15629.php" title="Crappy MP3 Sites, Comment Spamming &#038; Enough Already">Crappy MP3 Sites, Comment Spamming &#038; Enough Already</a></strong><br/>In covering search marketing for the past 13 years, I&#8217;ve  tried not to be judgmental about certain marketing tactics some people might  undertake. Search engines have &#8220;rules&#8221; that they themselves knowingly allow  others to break. Arguments erupt over the idea that any type of marketing is  &#8220;manipulation.&#8221; But at some point, enough is enough with some tactics. And  today, I&#8217;m done. I&#8217;m calling bullshit on anyone who is link spamming or creating  crappy nonsensical content sites. Seriously, enough. You&#8217;ve wasted enough of my time, and you&#8217;ve wasted enough  time of people all over the web. I&#8217;ll give you a personal illustration of this  below. Sure, I&#8217;ll skewer Google along the way. </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/yahoo-launches-vertical-lens-search-through-boss-15618.php" title="Yahoo Launches &#8220;Vertical Lens&#8221; Search Through BOSS">Yahoo Launches &#8220;Vertical Lens&#8221; Search Through BOSS</a></strong><br/>Yahoo announced an expansion to the BOSS technology named &#8220;vertical lens&#8221; technology.  In short, this allows developers build their own vertical search engines using Yahoo&#8217;s search technology, through BOSS.  This new technology is replacing Yahoo&#8217;s old Search Builder tool. TechCrunch is one of the first to deploy a &#8220;vertical lens&#8221; on their site.  TechCrunch&#8217;s solution searches technology-focused articles on both TechCrunch.com and across Yahoo&#8217;s web index.  So this helps improve TechCrunch&#8217;s internal site search, and also give searchers other relevant search results that are not found on TechCrunch&#8217;s domain.  Here is a picture that shows how TechCrunch implemented this BOSS technology:</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/comscore-yahoo-still-major-player-in-japan-15626.php" title="comScore: Yahoo Still Major Player In Japan">comScore: Yahoo Still Major Player In Japan</a></strong><br/>comScore has released metrics on search market share in Japan.  Overall, in September, Japanese searchers searched 5.9 billion times, with an average of 96 searches per user.   Yahoo is beating Google out in searches, with over 3 billion searches conducted on Yahoo properties.  Google properties counted for just under 2.3 billion searches.  Yahoo has a 51.2% market share in Japan, while Google has 39% share, while Microsoft has a 1.5% share with 90 million searches.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-makes-streetview-bigger-easier-to-use-15619.php" title="Meet Pegman: Google Makes StreetView Bigger, Easier To Use">Meet Pegman: Google Makes StreetView Bigger, Easier To Use</a></strong><br/>Who knew that the little &#8220;man&#8221; that helps users navigate StreetView is called &#8220;Pegman&#8221;? As much as I&#8217;m a fan of StreetView, there was always something a bit awkward about maneuvering the little man on the map to launch the StreetView image window. But Google has now made a number of improvements that make it easier to use Pegman himself and StreetView in general.  </li>
