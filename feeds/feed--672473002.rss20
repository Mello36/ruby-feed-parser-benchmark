President-elect, Barack Obama, had spent his entire campaign promising these so-called changes. I guess, in a sense, he was saying we are entering the beginning phase of &lt;b&gt;America 2.0.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig01.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step in the re-building process would be to start the country fresh with a new logo. As a nation, how are we to attract new, prospective citizens with the current one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig02.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, there are, like, a hundred stars, which just mucks up the entire design off the bat. And what's with the dark, dreary, colors? When was this thing designed? 1992?&lt;br /&gt;And the sharp corners? Everyone knows rounded corners are a lot more inviting to click-through, and that's what we want from a passerby who happens to come across America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What better way to start re-branding the country than with a fresh new logo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig03.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economical crisis facing the nation is probably due to design, as well. I mean, who  would put any value on such a horribly designed piece of currency?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig04.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it's just busy as hell, with &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s plastered on every square inch of the thing, and signatures of everyone and their grandmother scrawled across the bottom. And who in their right mind thought that seaweed green would be an appealing color of choice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just will not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's revamp the nation's currency to get this economy rolling again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig05.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hear the economy growing already. With our economy back on the right track, we'll be able to focus back on the real issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is, re-shaping America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I propose we start the process with the squarest states, such as Colorado and Wyoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig06.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And simply re-shape them to suit the new America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig07.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the final step would be to transform all of the national landmarks to suit the new country's brand, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first to go would be the Hollywood sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig08.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And re-create it using the friendlier, softer, more popular &amp;quot;today&amp;quot; font, VAG Rounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig09.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe America is ready for change. Change is nothing to fear. After all, the country was built on change. It's as American as baseball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://aviary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/redesign_america/america20fig10.png' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, a country can't be held accountable for it's actions and behavior.

He asks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Do you think certain people are born natural artists? Or do you think anybody can draw awesomer with practice?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your question, Vijay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a fascinating, ongoing debate among those with no lives. Just for you, I set out on my path to discover the true answer, whether or not &amp;quot;awesomer&amp;quot; is a learnable trait. Personally, I believe almost all of us are born with the inherent ability to draw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome00.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the early cave paintings to the hieroglyphs in Egypt, there is evidence showing that man has always had a fascination with creating. And as with anything, we have the need to perfect everything we do. So it only stands to reason that throughout the history of humankind, throughout generation to generation and culture to culture, we've spent our entire existence on Earth trying to discover the secrets of true beauty in art and form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is it that makes certain art... awesomer than others? Does it have to do with composition? Aesthetics? Color? &amp;quot;Overlay&amp;quot; blend mode?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correct answer is none of the above.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's actually very simple. Think of it this way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make food saltier, what do you add? Salt.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to make a drawing awesomer, what do you add? You add &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Draw Awesomer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to paint a portrait of a woman for my tutorial example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1.&lt;/b&gt; As with a lot of drawing tutorials, I start off my figure by drawing the basic skeleton for the woman. I draw in an oval shape for the head, with a line to indicate her spine drawn out from the woman's neck area. I then mark off where the shoulders will be, and include the woman's hands into the image. I now have my basic composition ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome01.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2.&lt;/b&gt; The next step is to start fleshing out the figure. Using thin sausage shapes, I add in the woman's bicep and forearms. Then I start to outline around the figure, giving me the general shape of the woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome02.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3.&lt;/b&gt; Fairly simple so far? I thought so. Now that we have the outline for the figure drawn, it was time to color the woman. I began painting over the woman using a skin tone, following my guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome03.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's the important part.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4.&lt;/b&gt; This is the final step, the step where people often deviate. A lot of people choose to add crap to their image at this point. But I find you get a much nicer image if you decide to add awesome. And anyone can do it! Simply add awesome where there wasn't any. I went back to my partially colored example figure and proceeded to add awesome to the image. And after adding about a 67% dosage of awesome, I decided my image was complete. Feel free to add your own desired level of awesome. (Tip: The more awesome you add, the awesomer your image will become.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome04.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it, a simple way for anyone to make their art awesomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this secret been known earlier, the landscape of art may be completely different today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, nobody knows why Picasso was heralded as an art genius. In this example by Picasso (&amp;quot;Tete de Femme of Dora Maar&amp;quot;), we can see many glaring flaws apparently not noticeable to the easily impressed art public of the 1930s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome05.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examples:&lt;br /&gt;A) Picasso uses two completely different perspectives for the woman's eyes. (Human eyes don't do that. Feel free to check a mirror to confirm.)&lt;br /&gt;B) Picasso lazily draws a figure eight for the woman's nasal cavities.&lt;br /&gt;C) Apparently, this was supposed to be the woman's hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's disheartening that such an amateur can be as successful in the art world as he was with his skills (or lack thereof). It's even more sad to realize that his weakness in drawing humans could have simply been remedied by adding more awesome where the awesome was lacking. If only I were around back then to teach him the ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a rendition of the painting, had Picasso decided to add more awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://aviary.com/home' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='/images_orig/blog/meowza/draw_awesome/addawesome06.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picasso's original &amp;quot;Tete de Femme of Dora Maar&amp;quot; portrait was estimated worth 13-17 million dollars. To think how much more it could have been worth today for his estate had he decided to be a little more generous with the awesome during his time, boggles the mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we here at Aviary are on the ball when it comes to innovation, as an &amp;quot;Add Awesome&amp;quot; filter is already in the works for Aviary's image editor, Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a demonstration of the filter in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align='center'&gt;&lt;object width="550" height="460"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-j7kVu8FDoA"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allownetworking" value="internal"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed allownetworking="internal" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-j7kVu8FDoA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="550" height="460"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;noembed&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j7kVu8FDoA' class='author' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'&gt;&lt;b&gt;flash video&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noembed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there you have it, how to draw awesomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's so simple it boggles the mind that the secret wasn't discovered earlier. To think that all the wasted generations of crappy art didn't have to be so. But no time to dwell on our losses now!

But while things are slowly but surely becoming free, I still believe people are willing to pay for certain value propositions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://flickr.com/photos/laffy4k/279583606/' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/107/279583606_01243e2d4f.jpg?v=0' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://flickr.com/photos/laffy4k/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Image courtesy of laffy4k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the following 5 things are uniquely profitable in a world of free:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Convenience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are inherently lazy. If you make their lives easier, they will pay you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.itunes.com' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/michael/itunes.jpg' alt=''  style='padding-right:20px;padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;float:right'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There are several ways to listen or download music for free, yet people are still paying for songs via &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.itunes.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because of how easy it is to find and download music on those sites. People value their time more than the 99 cents per download. If you make things convenient and easy people will pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Quality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.metafilter.com' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://testrookery.viary.com/storagev12/497500/497568_fa88_625x625.jpg' alt=''  style='padding-right:20px;padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;float:right'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Price ensures a more serious and interested clientele. There are many online forums that are free (i.e. &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sitepoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.dpreview.com/forums/register.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;DPreview&lt;/a&gt;), but there are also a handful you need to pay for to access (i.e. &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.webmasterworld.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webmasterworld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.somethingawful.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;SomethingAwful&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.metafilter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;metafilter&lt;/a&gt;). I believe the reason people are willing to pay for those online communities is because the quality of the content is better. There is a higher signal to noise ratio. This same premise applies to dating sites. People will pay for membership to online dating sites, as opposed to finding dates through any number of free social networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Additional Functionality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.37signals.com' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/michael/37signals.jpg' alt=''  style='padding-right:20px;padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;float:right'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Many websites give consumers just enough services to whet their pallets, and then charge for more functionality or more services, also called the &amp;quot;&lt;a class="author" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium_business_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;freemium model&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Notable examples include the &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.37signals.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;37 Signals&lt;/a&gt;' product offering, &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flickr's Pro Account&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Customization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.wordpress.com' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/michael/wordpress.jpg' alt=''  style='padding-right:20px;padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;float:right'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="author" href="Wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of this. They provide anyone the ability to have their own personal blog for free however they charge for the ability to customize the CSS or a the blogs domain name for additional fees. &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.smugmug.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Smugmug&lt;/a&gt; is another example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Privacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.godaddy.com' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/michael/godaddy.jpg' alt=''  style='padding-right:20px;padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;float:right'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; People still value keeping their private information private. To protect their identity people are willing to pay &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt; an extra fee when registering a domain name to ensure the address remains undisclosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you value enough that you are willing to open your wallet for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;========&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note 1: I would like to delve into this further and have proposed a talk for next year's SXSW conference on this topic. If this discussion is of interest to you, I welcome any feedback and &lt;a class="author" href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1850" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;would appreciate your vote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;========&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://www.kk.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, Wired Magazine's cofounder, has a really great list of attributes he asserts are &amp;quot;&lt;a class="author" href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;better than free&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; These qualities people will pay for in a digital age and include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Immediacy&lt;br /&gt;2. Personalization&lt;br /&gt;3. Interpretation&lt;br /&gt;4. Authenticity&lt;br /&gt;5. Accessibility&lt;br /&gt;6. Embodiment&lt;br /&gt;7. Patronage&lt;br /&gt;8.

I, personally, can not draw a horse to save my life. I can't imagine a situation where the difference between my life and death depends on my ability to draw a horse, but still, it's haunted me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything00.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've talked about my lack of ability to draw horses to many of my artist friends and peers. To my surprise, many of them recounted me their own secret, shameful inabilities to draw all sorts of subjects including hands, proportions, machinery etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then realized I was not alone in this. We all have our Achille's heel, and I wanted to help all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a while back, I asked users here to email me illustrations they just could not finish due to their own personal weaknesses, or to send me any illustrations for general critique on areas that could use improvement. So that maybe I could find a common thread in all of our inabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it dawned on me. All of our problems could be solved with one simple technique: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How To Draw Anything in One Step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be asking, &amp;quot;How could you possibly learn how to draw anything and everything in just one step? Are you a moron?&amp;quot; And if you are, there is no need for childish name-calling. Let's be civilized adults here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow along as I teach you how to draw everything, in this tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1. Draw a dog covering the thing you can't draw.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't believe this works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember how I asked users to send me their problem illustrations? Well, let's test it out firsthand, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandon Kobayashi from Burnaby, Canada sent me this email and his illustration of a woman sitting on a tree stump:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything01.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I often find myself having difficulties drawing human feet. Do you have any tips on how to improve my ability (or lack thereof) in that department?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure there is, Brandon. Just follow my tutorial and you will be set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;. When finding you can't draw feet, conveniently enough, a dog decided to rest at the woman's feet the day the portrait was painted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything02.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie Goode of Auburn, WA, wrote me asking for help on this particular image:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything03.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I don't seem to have problems drawing bodies, but I am mystified when it comes to getting the proportions of a human face just right.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Melanie, I see you're off to the conventional start by adding in the guidelines for the facial features. Most art instructors teach this very method. But I find it's a lot easier if you follow my tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;. Pretend a dog ran across the woman's face the day she decided to lay in the grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything04.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point you're probably wondering, &amp;quot;Wow, this is great! But will this technique work in different illustrative styles, as well?&amp;quot; Why, thank you for the compliment! And yes, it will work in all illustration styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, Ken Tanaka from San Diego, CA sent me a cartoon image of a solider he wanted depicting an M-16 machine gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;. I have never personally been interested in drawing weaponry, but even with my lack of experience I was able to use my own tutorial to complete the image of a soldier holding an M-16 machine gun. (Who just happened to be walking along the direct path of a leaping golden retriever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything05.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people of all ages can do it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Lee of (address undisclosed) sent me a drawing by her 6 year old son and told me how he loved to draw dinosaurs and wants to learn to draw them more realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything06.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, first off, dinosaurs do not talk, smile, nor has there ever been (in any official documented report) a dinosaur that existed labeled a Kevinsaurus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how will my system work on a 6 year olds drawing? Very well, actually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;. As we can add multiple dogs to cover the child's numerous, major technical flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything07.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it: The be-all, end-all of illustration tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my method, I guarantee you'll find yourself with a newfound ability to draw anything and everything you can imagine on this big, round Earth. Including the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src='http://a.viary.com/images_orig/blog/meowza/drawanything08.jpg' alt=''/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: &amp;quot;What if my weakness IS drawing dogs?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;A: It's time to change hobbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://a.viary.com/bizblog/posts/how-to-draw-anything-in-1-step#comments"&gt;Comment on this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/aviarybiz/~4/371967559" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/aviarybiz/~3/371967559/how-to-draw-anything-in-1-step</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://a.viary.com/bizblog/posts/how-to-draw-anything-in-1-step</guid><category>meowza</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2008 00:00:01 EST</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://a.viary.com/bizblog/posts/how-to-draw-anything-in-1-step</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[A health inducing habit]]></title><description>Like just about everyone else I know, I'd been meaning to join a gym for quite some time. Until a few months ago I'd run the gamut of excuses: &amp;quot;I don't have enough time;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I can't afford to join right now;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don't have enough energy after the long commute;&amp;quot; etc, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://flickr.com/photos/flissphil/7411413/' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/8/7411413_24f90a9412.jpg?v=0' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://flickr.com/photos/flissphil/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Image courtesy of PhillipC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, after complaining about how I never have the energy to do anything, friend of mine who had been going through a similar predicament told me that she had just joined a gym and was paying only $5 a month. Whaaa? $5 a month in the city? How can that be? Apparently her health insurance &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.thatsfit.com/2007/06/22/receive-a-reimbursement-for-using-the-gym" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;offered a gym reimbursement plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every 6 month period, they'd reimburse her $200 if she attended a gym with cardiovascular equipment 50 times. (That comes out to slightly more than 2 times a week). &amp;quot;I can do that!&amp;quot; I thought, and off I went to determine if I too was entitled to such a reimbursement. Indeed I was, and after another 2 weeks of procrastination, I got off my lazy bum, waddled to the nearest gym and signed up on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align='center'&gt;&lt;object width="550" height="460"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pv5zWaTEVkI"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allownetworking" value="internal"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed allownetworking="internal" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pv5zWaTEVkI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="550" height="460"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;noembed&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv5zWaTEVkI' class='author' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'&gt;&lt;b&gt;flash video&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noembed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv5zWaTEVkI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Inspirational video courtesy of OK Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while, the only motivation I had to keep going was the desire to burn off the pounds earned from 9 hours in front of a computer screen with only a 15 minute interruption in the middle of the day for a pizza break. That and the fact that if I wanted that $200 reimbursement, I'd have to earn it. After 2 weeks of this I noticed that the effort required to get off my couch and work out had lessened. In fact, if I missed a day, I'd start to feel antsy. For the first time in a long time, I had too much energy. That's when I realized that I had somehow formed a health &amp;quot;inducing&amp;quot; habit. Wierd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're probably wondering what this has to do with tech, or even productivity in general. Well, in short, nothing. Not directly anyway. Indirectly, it's done a heck of a lot. The simple act of injecting something new and productive into my daily schedule has a positive impact on my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now tend to look at new things in a more positive light. I overcame one adversity (laziness), and other life challenges seem more manageable because of it.  When I go to the gym in the morning I find myself with a lot more energy earlier in the day. Instead of stumbling into work in the morning and staring blankly at my monitor for 20 minutes waiting for my brain to boot up, I spring into the office ready for action. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it's a common theme because people have been offering me similar advice all my life. I've only just set out on my path to an ordered existence, but clearly it's important enough to reiterate some of the tricks I've used to help keep me on track. More to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor's Note:Here are some helpful links for you to save money on gym memberships, depending on your insurance provider.

To that end, it's sometimes hard for me to understand why startups are so focused on growing their teams out during the early stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the talk about how good communication is key for a team's success, I have a counter idea: Avoid having to communicate in the first place. Communication is not the ideal to a team's success; less team members to communicate with is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The closer a team size moves to one, the more efficient its productivity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Bezos likes to refer to the ideal team size as &amp;quot;&lt;a class="author" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/bezos_2.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;two-pizza teams&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;quot; any team that is small enough that they can be fed by a couple of pizza pies, is a model of efficiency and accomplishment. Anything larger is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/randysonofrobert/334385283/' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/334385283_0bfab8f994.jpg?v=0' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/randysonofrobert/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Image courtesy of Randy son of Robert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The medium is the mess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communication is actually &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt;. It inherently involves a loss of information. The more communication that is needed, the less of the product plan will be efficiently implemented according to the original vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the impossibility of trying to tell a friend about a wierd dream you had the previous night. Can you convey every single detail of the dream before it fades? Of course not. You have constraints (like time and memory), so you cut out anything which is &amp;quot;insignificant.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same holds true for any project plan. The larger the amount of people to convey information to, the less efficient you can be at it. Explaining to one person every detail of the plan is tedious enough. Imagine having to do the same for multiple people. Daisy chaining the information so that it is passed on from executives to managers to smaller groups has its own problems: Information loss and corruption at multiple points. It's the age-old game of &amp;quot;operator,&amp;quot; only with results that are not nearly so funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When there is one person both running and operating the entire show, you have 0% communication efficiency loss. The vision is designed and implemented exactly as it was originally conceived. Add a second teammate and you automatically introduce inefficiency into the equation. With each new person added to a team, the potential for communication efficiency loss gets worse as each person creates failure points with every other person.  Once you start getting beyond 8 team members, the efficiency loss becomes so great that it can only be made up by throwing additional resources at the problem. In other words, you are not going to see double the output from a team of 15 people as you will with a team of 8 (even though you'd expect it on paper). In fact, you'd be lucky to see even a 25% increase in output, even though your team size has doubled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping your team small&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what's the overarching lesson? You don't need a huge team to successfully launch a start up. In fact, your chances of succeeding are &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;, the smaller your team size. You cut out as many communication points of failure as possible and keep your startup costs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do you keep your team small? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Choose a project that is simple to implement.&lt;/b&gt; Don't try to create a complex suite of applications. (Yeah, I'm a hypocrite). Focus on solving a single problem. &lt;a class="author" href="http://hitmelater.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Philip Kaplan made email more efficient to use&lt;/a&gt; by stalling it instead of managing it. Dead simple approach and a great idea.Take the easier approach when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Choose people that can wear multiple hats.&lt;/b&gt; Can your designer code? Can your programmer manage a community? Can your marketing guru fund raise? &lt;i&gt;Can one guy do it all?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://flickr.com/photos/mike-burns/2703726345/' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img  src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/2703726345_01e965cb95.jpg' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://flickr.com/photos/mike-burns/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Image courtesy of Mike Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Document everything.&lt;/b&gt; It's obvious that you will need a business plan. What's not so obvious is that you should also document the seemingly mundane; methods used for team communication, methods used for integrating with potential partners, methods used for keeping a company blog up-to-date and interesting. All documentation should be available via a central location. A wiki can work really well for this purpose. Good documentation lessens the loss from communication failures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Arrange your workspace in common areas&lt;/b&gt;. Segregating your team in different offices is a recipe for lost communication data and with it, a need for additional people. You'd be surprised at how many roles can be shared by multiple people, so long as they have the ability to communicate instantly and unimpeded with each other. Put people between walls, and those shared tasks will need to be managed by additional team members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are examples of two-pizza teams that generated some of the most popular community content sites online:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.fark.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.worth1000.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Worth1000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.newgrounds.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Newgrounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.somethingawful.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;SomethingAwful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://del.icio.us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.metafilter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Metafilter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.etsy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.reddit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a class="author" href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know any others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://a.viary.com/bizblog/posts/the-power-of-small-teams#comments"&gt;Comment on this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/aviarybiz/~4/368219310" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/aviarybiz/~3/368219310/the-power-of-small-teams</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://a.viary.com/bizblog/posts/the-power-of-small-teams</guid><category>avi</category><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 12:00:00 EST</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://a.viary.com/bizblog/posts/the-power-of-small-teams</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
