        <![CDATA[<p>We launched <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss">Yahoo! Search BOSS </a>this past July and we just reached a significant milestone - the BOSS API is currently serving more than 10 million queries per day.   10 million in and of itself isn't particularly significant, but we're sharing it because we believe growing to more than 100 queries a second in just over 5 months says something about the demand for an open search platform.  As a point of reference, the total queries from these developer-built, BOSS-powered search engines would rank ahead of the combined searches done on both Facebook and Amazon, and just behind Ask.com<sup>1</sup>. Note that because these queries are delivered via the BOSS API and served up by our partners, they aren't counted as Yahoo! Search queries by comScore or other metrics providers. </p>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000599.html">launch</a>, we've been focused on adding <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000654.html">features</a> and building up the ecosystem. We'll maintain that emphasis in 2009, as well as adding monetizing capabilities to the platform.  Our plans have been driven by what we've heard from developers on our <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ysearchboss/">Yahoo! Group</a> and at six hack days held around the <a href=":http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000647.html">world</a>.  We still have a great deal of work ahead, but the feedback we've received from the BOSS community has validated our hypothesis that there really was a need for a service like BOSS to help power innovation in search. </p>

<p>If you're interested in checking out what's been built using BOSS, here are a few places to look:</p>

<li><a href="http://delicious.com/tag/bossmashup">Mashups tagged on Delicious</li>
<li><a href="http://search.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch Search</a></ul>

<p>Thanks to everyone in the BOSS community for helping to make this happen and for being vocal about what we should be working on next.  Keep it up!</p>

As we've <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/10/swinging_throug.html">reported before</a>, MashMaker is not only a powerful tool that enables non-programmers to extract semantic data from websites to create mashups, but you can also use MashMaker to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/post.chris/searchmonkey-mash-maker-tutorial-presentation">rapidly create extractors for SearchMonkey applications</a>. If you haven't tried using MashMaker and SearchMonkey together yet, you can <a href="http://mashmaker.intel.com/web/download.html">download MashMaker</a>, click on the little monkey icon and give it a try.</p>

<p>In related award news, we are pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a> has recognized SearchMonkey as one of its <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_semantic_web_products_2008.php">Top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008</a> for "the best use of Semantic Web by an Internet bigco this year."

        <![CDATA[<p>We just took a <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000648.html">look back</a> at the progress we've made over the last year with <a href="http://tools.search.yahoo.com/newsearch/searchassist">Search Assist</a> and a look forward to our goals of continuing to improve the usefulness of our assistance technology.</p>

<p>With this objective in mind, we recently launched Search Assist for <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/">image search</a> to guide users to the answers they seek in a new way. To better enhance the search experience, we took a two-tiered approach to the query formulation and refinement process. In the first stage, we've maintained the same paradigm of text suggestions that have helped users of web search complete and refine queries. The second stage is new - from now on, Search Assist can be opened after a query is entered into the search box for users to preview sample thumbnails for the top related search terms. </p>

<p>So if you search for <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0S020oMyzZJEXUA49CJzbkF?p=roses&fr=&ei=utf-8&x=wrt&y=Search">roses</a> in image search, you can preview the types of results you'll get for <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0S020puzDZJlJoA_N.JzbkF?fr2=sg-gac&sado=1&p=red%20roses&ei=utf-8&x=wrt">red roses</a>, <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0S020puzDZJlJoA_N.JzbkF?fr2=sg-gac&sado=1&p=guns%20n%20roses&ei=utf-8&x=wrt">Guns N' Roses</a> or <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0S020puzDZJlJoA_N.JzbkF?fr2=sg-gac&sado=1&p=black%20roses&ei=utf-8&x=wrt">black roses</a> before clicking on the suggestion. This way, you know what images to expect before drilling down deeper to find your answers. </p>

<p><br />
Search Assist for images has already been launched on the search results page and we'll be launching it on <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo.com</a> soon. Stay tuned for more improvements to Search Assist for image search in the near future. And please share your feedback in the comments below.  </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It's that time of year again when we look back at what was 2008 through the billions of search queries we receive each month and from the millions of users who help paint this picture. This year we've teamed up with <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Buzz </a>to bring to you the <a href="http://yearinreview.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! 2008 Year in Review</a>. </p>

<p>Not only are we presenting the top ten searches, we are also including overall themes and popular trends that bubbled to the surface , including the economy, politicians, news stories, Olympians, rising celebrities, influential women, and notable deaths.  Searches within these themes covered the gamut, from Miley Cyrus' controversial Vanity Fair cover to the notorious pregnant man and farewell searches of Heath Ledger and Bernie Mac. Michael Phelps also pulled in the highest searches of any Olympian, while Angelina Jolie and Sarah Palin gained top positions in the influential women category. </p>

<p>Additional "top tens" were also included in this year's review across select areas of Yahoo! such as, <a href="http://food.yahoo.com/blog/yahoofreshpicks/2224/top-10-yahoo-food-recipes-of-2008">Yahoo! Food</a>, <a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/none/shine-s-most-popular-posts-of-2008-297112/">Shine</a>, <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/108862/2008s-top-ten-most-searched-tech-terms/">Tech</a>, <a href="http://green.yahoo.com/blog/greenpicks/218/environment-headlines-with-the-most-buzz.html">Green</a>, <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/seasonals/holidays/top-10-products-of-2008--784724867">Shopping</a>, <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-promo-24664442">Travel</a>, <a href="http://videogames.yahoo.com/feature/top-10-most-popular-casual-games/1260712">Games</a>, <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/top-trailers-of-2008.html">Movies</a>, <a href="mobile.yahoo.com/top10mobilesearches2008">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/videogaga/10198/yahoo-musics-top-10-videos-of-2008/">Music</a>, <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/top-tens/top-10-restaurants.html">Local</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/news/archives/2008/11/04/top_ten_/">Upcoming</a>, <a href="http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/career-articles-a_2008_retrospective_in_career_data_resources-562">Hot Jobs</a>, most Buzzed-Up stories and clicked-on stories from yahoo.com.</p>

<p>What a year it was! Looking over all of the top ten lists and search activity for 2008, we pulled out some interesting tidbits we thought you'd find interesting.  Users were captivated by this year's historic US Presidential election, with the Olympic triumphs closely following. The economic downturn was another issue that grabbed up a lot of user's attention.  Of course, there was still time to enjoy a little escape by devouring celebrity gossip and delving into online video games.</p>

<p>And despite all of the activity surrounding the 2008 Presidential elections, Britney Spears still gained the number one spot as the top searched person (7 out of 8 years). She did make some news this year with a new album, three MTV Music Awards, a sitcom guest star role and documentary on her rise. People just can't get enough of her! </p>

<p>Barack Obama was the second most searched person in 2008 and the third most popular search term.  Headlines of his election victory received more clicks than any other story on yahoo.com this year. Obama soared up the search ranks as the election campaign moved forward with consumers using search to get informed, learn more about him and decide how to vote in this critically important election.</p>

<p>There was some debate on whether or not Britney Spears could outrank President-elect Barack Obama as the most searched term and most searched person in 2008. According to a recent Yahoo! Search survey*, most people thought Barack Obama (38 percent) would be the most searched person on the Web followed by Britney Spears (27 percent).  It's not over yet, though! With one more month remaining in 2008, President Obama may still outrank his top search opponent.  </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months we've showcased a handful of innovative mashups that developers have created using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/">Yahoo! Search BOSS</a>.  The creations have ranged in functionality and focus, but all have included interesting applications of Yahoo! Search's index, infrastructure and technology.  Today, we're sharing another useful application of BOSS that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/index.php">TechCrunch</a> just launched - a technology-flavored Web search engine.  This new search engine enables TechCrunch users to search for technology-focused articles and company information across both the TechCrunch network of sites and the rest of the Web.<br />
 <br />
This partnership with TechCrunch illustrates a new BOSS capability called vertical lens technology, which enables partners, often with no search expertise, to create a truly comprehensive vertical search engine that complements their core user experience.  Using BOSS, TechCrunch now provides a one-stop shop for all types of search.  BOSS not only improves TechCrunch's standard site search, it also integrates relevant technology content on people, products and companies from across the Web.   And if a user conducts a non-tech focused search, they'll see relevant Web search results. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3056453935/" title="BOSS.TechCrunch by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3043/3056453935_2d90cce0fa.jpg" width="500" height="319" alt="BOSS.TechCrunch" /></a><br />
 </p>

<p>BOSS vertical lens technology provides a handful of features that were implemented on TechCrunch: <br />
<b><ul><li>Real-time indexing of proprietary content</b></li> - Once TechCrunch content is added or a user comment is submitted, the search index almost immediately reflects the changes.<br />
<b><li>Customized ranking</b></li> - The BOSS and TechCrunch teams worked closely to fine-tune the ranking algorithm to fit the TechCrunch audience and user experience.<br />
<b><li>Structured search</b></li> - BOSS supports faceted refinement around TechCrunch's structured content.  This offers powerful tools for people who want to fine tune their searches or browse TechCrunch content - e.g. narrowing in on <a href="http://search.techcrunch.com/query.php?y=%2Ftc_eng_id%2Fsearch%2Fv1%2Fquery%2Ftwitter%3Fcategory_id%3DTechCrunch%2520Search%26author%3DMichael%2520Arrington">articles on Twitter written only by Michael Arrington</a>, or only the <a href="http://search.techcrunch.com/query.php?y=%2Ftc_eng_id%2Fsearch%2Fv1%2Fquery%2F%3Fcategory_id%3DTechCrunch%2520Search%26sort%3Dcomments%26client%3Dtechcrunch">most popular </a>articles (popularity is determined by number of comments), or <a href="http://search.techcrunch.com/query.php?y=%2Ftc_eng_id%2Fsearch%2Fv1%2Fquery%2F%3Fcategory_id%3DCrunchbase-Company%26founded%3D2008_2009">locating all companies that are founded in 2008</a>.   <br />
<b><li>Blending Web with proprietary content in a single search display</b></li>- After querying both the TechCrunch and the Web indices, BOSS blends the results to produce one result set that is both relevant and comprehensive. </ul> </p>

<p>BOSS vertical lens is currently available to certain Yahoo! partners - but we're working to share the technology more openly through the BOSS API.  If you are interested in building a search product using BOSS vertical lens technology, please email us <a href="mailto:bosscustom@yahoo-inc.com">here</a>. Our partnership with TechCrunch highlights the beginning of many more BOSS partner launches as Yahoo! continues to open up its search technologies and infrastructure to the world. </p>

<p>Take a look at TechCrunch's <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/26/techcrunchs-new-search-engine-powered-by-yahoo-boss/">article</a> for additional background and insight.</p>

<p>Stay tuned. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Search</a> visited Tel Aviv, Israel as part of our international BOSS Hack Day series. Our goal with these Hack Days is to educate developers around the world on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/">Yahoo! Search BOSS</a>, share where the platform is headed and foster the development of innovative new search experiences using BOSS.</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3046473754/" title="TelAvivHackDay by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/3046473754_2f14510f96.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="TelAvivHackDay" /></a></p>

<p> <br />
The BOSS team got together with 100 developers and entrepreneurs in Tel Aviv for a detailed presentation on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/boss_guide/">BOSS API</a>, presented in Hebrew by BOSS Engineering Director Eran Palmon. After the presentation, developers had the chance to build their own mashup creations that were then reviewed by a panel of judges. We received 20+ mashups and judging is complete. <br />
 <br />
Drum roll, please...<br />
 <br />
The winning team, <a href="http://www.getthepicsure.com/">Get the Pic</a>, wrote an addictive phrase guessing game (similar to Hang-Man), based on Yahoo! BOSS image, news and web search APIs.   </p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3045460239/" title="GetThePic by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3057/3045460239_57d989d181.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="GetThePic" /></a></p>

<p><br />
The ingenuity and entrepreneurship exhibited at the Hack Day in Tel Aviv was encouraging, especially as we continue to forge our relationship with developers in this region. In fact, <a href="http://www.delver.com/">Delver</a>, an Israel-based social search company, recently <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Delver-Partners-With-Yahoo-prnews-13458334.html">launched</a> its search engine powered in part by BOSS. There's no doubt that we'll continue to see new and inventive search experiences from developers there.<br />
 <br />
For more details on our developer event in Tel Aviv, check out this recent <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/11/yahoo_hack_day_1.html">post</a> from the Yahoo! Developer Network. We've captured more <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/17415804@N00/sets/72157608766296193/detail/">photos</a> of the event as well.  </p>

<p>Farewell for now, Tel Aviv...see you in 2009.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>You may have heard about our experimental visual display of search results on Yahoo! India, called <a href="http://in.search.yahoo.com/search?p=diabetes&ei=UTF-8&iscqry=&fr=sfp&rd=r1&quot;">Glue(TM) Pages</a>. Tonight we're launching a similar, but slightly different experience in the U.S. with <a href="http://glue.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Glue(TM) beta</a>.  This newest iteration is a standalone experience focused on assembling useful information from all over the Web, giving users a new place to discover and explore images, videos, articles and more.  </p>

<p>We're starting with a limited set of topics (more will be added over time), pulling together content from the best places on the Web onto one Yahoo! Glue(TM) page. These pages are built using an algorithm that automatically places the most relevant modules on a page, giving you a visually rich, diverse page all about the topic in which you're interested.</p>

<p>To see it in action, check out some of the Glue pages on some popular people, places and things:  <a href="http://glue.yahoo.com/page/new+york+giants">New York Giants</a>, <a href="http://glue.yahoo.com/page/henry+paulson">Henry Paulson</a>, <a href="http://glue.yahoo.com/page/electoral+college">Electoral College</a>, <a href="http://glue.yahoo.com/page/hugh+jackman">Hugh Jackman</a>, etc.</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3044099021/" title="Hugh Jackman v2 by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/3044099021_d44877378d.jpg" width="500" height="434" alt="Hugh Jackman v2" /></a><br />
 </p>

<p>For those that may be wondering, our intention with Yahoo! Glue(TM) beta is not to replace the Yahoo! Search experience in the US.  We're always challenging ourselves to explore innovative new ways to deliver great experiences.  Glue is one of those experiments, with a goal of giving users one more visual way to browse and discover new things from across the Web.  We'll be working to expand the number of Glue pages, improve the experience and incorporate your feedback into future versions.</p>

<p>We'll be rolling this out over the next few hours, so go ahead and give it a try at <a href="http://glue.yahoo.com/">glue.yahoo.com</a>.  We think it's pretty sticky (we had to have one "glue" pun in this post), and we'd love your feedback. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>You puzzle lovers out there may remember that we <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000495.html">launched</a> a crossword puzzle game that combined the Search Assist feature to provide helpful hints from Yahoo! Search last Fall. After all, many of us aren't born with the natural "crossword gene" (myself included) and having a helping hand to unscramble the word simply doubles the fun.</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3043339949/" title="Search Games FP by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/3043339949_f33ebe92bb.jpg" width="500" height="223" alt="Search Games FP" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Many users told us that they really enjoyed the game and were sad when it was removed after a brief period of time. That's why we teamed up with Yahoo! Games and worked hard to create two games that are refreshed daily - <a href="http://games.yahoo.com/daily-games/daily-crossword-with-yahoo-search-offsite/">Daily Crossword</a> and <a href="http://games.yahoo.com/daily-games/hollywood-jumble-offsite">Hollywood Jumble</a>. Following the recent launch on <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">www.yahoo.com</a> for Internet Explorer, we are thrilled to announce that they are now live for Firefox and Safari.  </p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3044210338/" title="Crossword 4 by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/3044210338_a0b651b7da.jpg" width="500" height="355" alt="Crossword 4" /></a></p>

<p><br />
So take a break and give yourself a brain boost with the puzzle games powered by Yahoo! Search. </p>

<p>Good luck and have fun.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today we're pleased to announce the availability of the first of a series of new BOSS features called Key Terms. </p>

<p>We began opening up our search infrastructure four months ago with Yahoo! Search BOSS. Since then, we've heard again and again in our <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ysearchboss/">developer group</a> and at conferences and hack days around the world that developers want more access to deep infrastructure assets.</p>

<p>Key Terms is derived from a Yahoo! Search capability we refer to internally as "Prisma." This is the same patented technology that powers <a href="http://tools.search.yahoo.com/newsearch/searchassist">Search Assist</a>. Key Terms is an ordered terminological representation of what a document is about. The ordering of terms is based on each term's frequency and its positional and contextual heuristics.</p>

<p>How could it be used?  Obviously it could be used as the basis for assistance and refinement technology (as we've done with Search Assist), but that's hardly the only possible application. Key Terms could be highly useful as input to semantic analysis or new relevancy models. They could also be used to analyze and cluster similar documents or as a vehicle for new visual experiences.  </p>

<p>For an example of Key Terms in use check out <a href="http://www.tartin3.com/index.php?query=coq+au+vin&t=ve">Tartin3.com</a>. It's a Parisian food search engine built by our very own epicurean developer Ted Drake. The "Related Terms" refiners under each result are pulled directly from Key Terms. 	<br />
 <br />
To provide API access to Key Terms, we're introducing a new universal parameter called "view." View is the argument that will provide a lens into deeper content. Appending "&view=keyterms" to the BOSS Web Search API call will result in Key Terms being included in the response.</p>

<p>In the example below, we included Key Terms in a query for <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=obama&">obama</a>. Each result contains up to 20 terms describing the document. The terms below describe the first result, for Change.gov.</p>

<p><br />
Check out the BOSS <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/boss_guide/">documentation</a> for all the details of how you can use Key Terms and other BOSS functionality. Last but not least, we've added Romanian, Hebrew, and Turkish language/region support to the BOSS APIs - details are also included in the documentation.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or feedback, we encourage you to post them to the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ysearchboss/">BOSS group</a>. We're committed to continuing to open our infrastructure and technology to developers, start-ups and established Internet companies, so if you have any thoughts on what should be next, we're all ears.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We just returned from two solid events on the BOSS Hack Day world tour. Last Monday's event in London drew a range of developers, including a few who were completely new to the platform along with a handful of experienced BOSS hackers (such as the developer from <a href="http://www.buildasearch.com/">BuildaSearch</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3038996550/" title="EU Hack Day 1 copy by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3213/3038996550_67e2dec4e0.jpg" width="500" height="288" alt="EU Hack Day 1 copy" /></a></p>

<p><br />
After a successful stop in London, the team headed to Paris to prepare for another event on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Paris event stood out for a couple of reasons. First, we were really pleased with the turnout. The event was held at a well-known Parisian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking">coworking</a> center called <a href="http://lacantine.org/">La Cantine</a>, which seemed to be at the hub of the developer community in Paris... it was packed. Even more impressive was how engaged everyone was. We started with a one-hour overview and technical discussion, broke for sushi and beer and then split into two workshops -- one on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/mashup.html">BOSS Mashup Framework</a> and one on building niche search engines using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/boss">BOSS</a> API.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/3038807842/" title="Sophie_Paris by Yahoo! Search Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3244/3038807842_0a8ecb7757_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sophie_Paris" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Almost all of the developers stayed until 10:30 or later that evening to learn more about BOSS and shared some excellent feedback on where we should take the product. Although neither of us speaks a lick of French, we had some great conversations. We met with the folks from <a href="http://www.veosearch.com/">Veosearch</a>, a BOSS-powered search engine that gives a percentage of its profits to charity, as well as the guys from <a href="http://iminent.com/">Iminent</a>, an IM add-on and contextual search company.</p>

<p><br />

<p><br />
We'd like to thank all the developers who joined us. Hearing directly from you about new features you'd like to see will help us prioritize our efforts in 2009. Also, big thanks to the Yahoo! teams in London and Paris for all their help in setting up and running the events.</p>

<p>If you weren't able to join us, we'll continue to host developer events in the coming months. In the meantime, you can check out more <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?ss=2&w=all&q=bossparis&m=tags">photos</a> and the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/graham_mudd/yahoo-search-boss-hack-days-in-paris-and-london-presentation/">slides</a> from our presentation.</p>
