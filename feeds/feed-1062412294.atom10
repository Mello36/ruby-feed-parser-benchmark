			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_207" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pict0055.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-207" title="Addison Christmas Picture (Original)" src="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pict0055-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Original Christmas Card Picture!</p></div>
<p>Finally, we selected our Christmas card picture!  Trying to get a 1-year old to smile, wear a Santa hat, and pose EXACTLY the way you want them is quite the challenge (I can&#8217;t imagine getting it done with two kids!).  I think between the two of us, Angela and I have taken 354 pictures just for Addison&#8217;s Christmas card &#8212; and this first image above was the BEST one!  Not that she doesn&#8217;t look cute in it, but I thought I would at least get a smile out of her!</p>
<p>Then, I had to put my Photoshop skills (actually, I used the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a>) to work and airbrush out that cut on her face &#8212; given to her by some boy who decided to pinch her (he was a one year old and really didn&#8217;t know better, but her mother should have!</p>
<div id="attachment_208" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pict0055_airbrushed.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-208" title="Addison's Christmas Card Picture (airbrushed)" src="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pict0055_airbrushed-300x199.jpg" alt="The Airbrushed Picture" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Airbrushed Picture</p></div>
<p>This picture above is the result of my meticulous airbrushing.  I felt like a magazine photo editor working on photos of Heidi Klum: it&#8217;s not really necessary, but had to be done.  It&#8217;s hard to tell that she&#8217;s even been pinched by the little meanie on the playground.  But now there&#8217;s a stroller and William&#8217;s (Addison&#8217;s cousin) butt in the picture!  What the heck do we do about that?  Well suffice it to say, <a href="http://photos.walmart.com" target="_blank">Walmart</a> (don&#8217;t go to <a href="http://www.snapfish.com" target="_blank">Snapfish</a> &#8212; they&#8217;re way too expensive &#8212; thank you Julie!) has this great feature on their photocards in which you can zoom in on the picture.  And that&#8217;s exactly what we did.  However, before we tried that, I decided to get even more creative.</p>
<div id="attachment_209" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/addison_christmas.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-209" title="Addison and the Christmas Tree" src="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/addison_christmas-300x199.jpg" alt="Addison's Airbrushed and the New Background" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Addison Airbrushed with The Christmas Tree Background</p></div>
<p>Angela and I did not like the background at all and we knew we needed something to spice it up.  I dug through last year&#8217;s Christmas pictures and found a picture of Addison with the Christmas tree reflected in our dining room mirror.  Again, I took on the role of magazine photo editor and added a new background!  If you look really closely off her left shoulder, you can see I airbrushed out a part of 4-month old Addison, and added in 1-year old Addison.  Voila!  A nice-looking Christmas picture of Addison!</p>
<p>Which picture did we actually use?  Well, check your mailbox and you&#8217;ll find out!!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_157" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/justborn.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-157" title="Addison Just Born" src="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/justborn-199x300.jpg" alt="Addison and her proud father" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Addison and her proud father</p></div>
<p>One year ago at this time, I did not have a daughter.  One year ago today I was not a father.  Angela was not a mother.  Angela was near the end of her 22 hour marathon labor, but we didn&#8217;t know that.  All we had were two names picked out . . . one for a boy, one for a girl.  About a year ago at this time, we were about two hours from meeting our very first child for the very first time.</p>
<div id="attachment_158" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 226px"><a href="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/oneyear.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-158" title="AddisonOneYear" src="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/oneyear-300x199.jpg" alt="Addison looking happy as always" width="216" height="143" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Addison looking happy as always</p></div>
<p>Now, today, we can&#8217;t imagine living with out our daughter.  Angela and I couldn&#8217;t be happier that we have a happy and healthy little girl, and we can&#8217;t believe that today is her first birthday.  So much has happened in her first year of life, and we have enjoyed ALMOST every minute of it (sometimes the no sleep thing got a little old and having a sick child is no picnic either . . . but it&#8217;s all a part of life and you learn how to handle it).  She&#8217;s already walking, and so close to saying her first word (she&#8217;s <a href="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/2008/08/25/my-conversation-with-addison/" target="_blank">talking in her own language</a> now).  I am amazed at how much she has accomplished in her first year of life.  And I am so proud to be the father of such a wonderful daughter.  Happy First Birthday Addison!!!</p>

<p>The Wadsworth Family Vacation proved once again that one of my long-term goals in life is to retire (at least for 6-months of the year) in Longboat Key.  Of course, I would rather win the lottery this weekend and immediately retire to Longboat Key, but I don&#8217;t see that happening any time soon (&#8221;You have to at least play the lottery to win the lottery&#8221;, as my esteemed friend Jesus quipped on our vacation down South).  Vacations are never long enough, but we try and enjoy them as much as we can.  I love seeing all of my family in one place at one time, and we always have a great time together.  We know that one day we won&#8217;t be able to see each other as much, but we hope to continue the Wadsworth Family Vacation as long as we can.  I know that Angela, Addison, and I will try our best to get down there every year.  Longboat Key is my favorite place to vacation in this entire world.  I have no doubt that one day I will own a place there to retire, and I hope to continue the tradition of the Wadsworth Family Vacation at Longboat Key.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian Rockies is just about the most beautiful place in the world, and more specifically, <a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a>.  It&#8217;s no comparison to <a href="http://www.longboatkey.org/">Longboat Key</a>, but I am particular to the warm sunny sandy beaches.  <a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a> is a small town about an hour and a half north of Calgary in the province of Alberta.  It&#8217;s a ski resort town in the Winter and, what Summer there is, it&#8217;s a hiking/camping/mountain biking/golf resort town in their &#8220;hot&#8221; months (Hot is a relative term here . . . they&#8217;re probably in a heat wave when it hits the 80s &#8212; and that&#8217;s Fahrenheit folks, even though it IS Canada).  It&#8217;s nice to be in a town where on your way to downtown, you&#8217;re view is:</p>
<p>
<img class="alignnone" style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://wadsworthsworld.com/saablog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/pict00531.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="512" />
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed every minute of it.  The views are spectacular.  The wildlife is amazing (even though we really didn&#8217;t see any this time around).  And the town is small enough not to be too overwhelming, but big enough to get all the necessities one might need.  For example, scotch.  I ordered a glass of <a href="http://www.themacallan.com">The Macallan 12-year</a>, possibly one of the best scotches I&#8217;ve ever had, and here&#8217;s what the fine folks at the <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/banffsprings/">Banff Springs Hotel</a> gave me for $20:

</p>
<div>
<div>Granted the scotch was free because our room wasn&#8217;t ready yet, but I spit bigger than that.  Yes, a lovely picture in your mind, but I couldn&#8217;t think of a better comparison.</div>

<p><div>Angela and I thought getting there would be quite the challenge with Addison, but she was quite the trooper.  I think she actually enjoys flying.  She might have had 1 or 2 outbursts the entire time (both to and from <a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a>), but she slept a lot and was in a great mood.  My favorite part of her trip there was the bus ride from Calgary to <a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a>.  Angela got to hold Addison most of the flying time, and now it was Daddy&#8217;s turn to hold Addison on the bus.  You&#8217;re probably thinking at this point the devil in Addison was going to emerge and cause havoc throughout the entire bus ride.  I was thinking the exact same thing as I sat down in the front seat with Addison in my lap.  You would be amazed to know that she sat down with me, titled her head on my arm, and gave the &#8220;Are we there yet?&#8221; stare.  Can you believe it?  A 10-month old already learning that!  It&#8217;s as if it were hereditary!  If you don&#8217;t believe me, just take a look:</div>

<div>Amazing!  Addison was quite the good girl both to and from <a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a>.  Sleeping at night was another story, but we can&#8217;t complain.  She was in the same room as her bear-like snoring Dad.  She probably thought a grizzly was right there in the room, waiting to take her away.  I can&#8217;t blame her for not sleeping!Finally, one of the best activities in which I participated has spoiled me forever: <a href="http://www.themacallan.com">GOLF</a>.  I have just gotten back into playing golf (played a bit in high school and dabbled a little in college recreationally), and I probably played the best course I will ever play in my entire life.  One around alone was well over $200 and renting clubs took me near the $300 range (luckily, it was all free!!!).  This course was quite challenging and my slice did not favor well on this course.  But I saw some of the most spectacular fairways and greens I have and will have ever seen.</div>

<p>
<a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a> was quite an experience, and we loved every minute of it.  One of these days, Angela and I will probably look into buying a place to retire, and <a href="http://www.banff.ca/home.htm">Banff</a> will be on the top of our list.  I would go back in a heartbeat . . . especially if my company is paying for it!</div>

Father&#8217;s Day was LAST weekend, but I can still write about it (plus one of my presents came last Saturday - a round of golf from Addison - which means I got a nice extended celebration).  I don&#8217;t think Addison enjoyed baseball too much as you can see here, but the Bowie Baysox game was a nice little Father&#8217;s Day treat.  As a father on my first official Father&#8217;s Day, I am looking forward to many more of these.  First of all, I&#8217;m proud to be a father and I&#8217;m happy to have Addison as my daughter.  She lights up my life, and I always love learning a little more about her every day.  Addison has at least one thing new to show me each day (on Father&#8217;s Day, for the first time, she transfered from the car seat into my arms without waking up).  Secondly, for selfish reasons, I finally have a day in the middle of the year where I can ask for something I need.  My birthday falls right around Christmas, and I&#8217;ve never had a holiday in the middle of the year where I can actually ask for something I need.  Both my Christmas list and birthday list end up being as thick as Ayn Rand&#8217;s <em>The Fountainhead</em>, and just about as exciting (not that I&#8217;ve ever read it before).  Father&#8217;s Day is becoming my new favorite holiday now that I am a father.  I can appreciate both being a father and realizing all the hard work my own father went through to be a great Dad.  I&#8217;m looking forward to all the future Father&#8217;s Days with Tobasco and Gator neck ties, and watching my daughter grow.</p>
