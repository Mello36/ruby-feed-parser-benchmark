Banana Derby is a "family show" in Greenville, South Carolina that stages races with monkey jockeys riding on dogs. For a fee, you can have them come to your next party or public event.

Pink Tentacle reports that researchers at Japan&#8217;s ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories have developed a system that can "<a href="http://www.pinktentacle.com/2008/12/scientists-extract-images-directly-from-brain/">reconstruct the images inside a person&#8217;s mind and display them on a computer monitor</a>."

<blockquote>The scientists were able to reconstruct various images viewed by a person by analyzing changes in their cerebral blood flow. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, the researchers first mapped the blood flow changes that occurred in the cerebral visual cortex as subjects viewed various images held in front of their eyes. Subjects were shown 400 random 10 x 10 pixel black-and-white images for a period of 12 seconds each. While the fMRI machine monitored the changes in brain activity, a computer crunched the data and learned to associate the various changes in brain activity with the different image designs.

<P>Then, when the test subjects were shown a completely new set of images, such as the letters N-E-U-R-O-N, the system was able to reconstruct and display what the test subjects were viewing based solely on their brain activity.</blockquote><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Here are a few:

   <blockquote>1. Electronic lookup tools: There are many variations (scanner + DB, phone browser, laptop, etc). I use a Palm Treo with Scoutpal that lets me input 10 ISBNs per query and I can check pre-ISBN title on ABE. Not state of the art certainly (and it's dependent on cell phone reception) but I haven't felt the need to upgrade.
<P>2. Scouting Book: A collection of title lists and identification points compiled through research and experience. Two lists I find very useful are a) $$$ Titles That Book Clerks Don't Know About and b) Out of Print DVD and VHS. I keep these lists on my Treo which I sync before heading out.
<P>9. Folding Wheely Cart: I'm fond of <a href="http://kart-a-bag.com/html/products.html">these models</a>. Good wheels, folds small and carries a ton.
<P>15. Handi-wipes and moisturizer: Few things are more disgusting than the gray and dried out hands you get after a few hours of digging through old books. If you plan to bring your hands anywhere near your face (or other people) handi-wipes are essential. I like the individually wrapped ones you find at Chinese restaurants.
<P>16. A Weapon?: There's been some talk on the Biblio list lately about self-defense for the bookdealer. While I haven't yet felt physically threatened at a sale, I've certainly found myself in bizarre and uncomfortable environments. I firmly believe you shouldn't pack a weapon that you don't want turned on you, but maybe learning a little book-fu is a good idea. An OED would make a fine bludgeon, pocket books fly like throwing stars.</blockquote><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

<p>Last year, BBtv attended, and we shot the episode above. You're not actually supposed to fry gadgets, and now that a year has passed, fine, I can reveal that <em>we did not really fry a cellphone.</em> It's all Final Cut magic. Fake. Fakefakefake. You <em>cannot fry cellphones</em>, or gadgets, or bailed-out automobile manufacturers, or credit default swaps, or <em>anything non-edible</em> at the Fry-B-Que. There, that's over with. I feel so much better.</p>
<p>Now, then. If you go, here is my advice: do not eat anything for like 48 hours beforehand. Here's the blurb from Machine Project:</p>
<blockquote>
  Fry-B-Q is here! Please join us on Sunday, December 14th at 8pm. This year there's a new twist â Pie-B-Q! Head to Machine for the fried food extravaganza and live music by Emily Lacy &amp; friends, and then go next door to our neighbors the Echo Park Film Center for screenings of new videos from the Machine Project Field Guide to LACMA, rare Machine home videos and pies. Pies! Starts at 8pm. Admission to the event is free, pay $5 for all you can fry privileges, and $5 for all you can pie privileges. Things to do:

  <p>1) Arrive between 8 - 11 pm Sunday Dec 14th.</p>

  <p>2) Bring something edible to fry. Our trained fryolater technicians will be standing by, eager to batter and fatify your soon to be delicious snacks. Our extensive testing suggests that almost any item will bring great fried satisfaction - potatoes, fish, vegetables, onions, twinkies, etc. Just in case we bought extra fire extinguishers.</p>

  <p>3) prepare for eating pie.</p>

  <p>4) Bring cash or checks (or credit cards) small and large and become a friend of Machine Project. We need your help to keep doing what we do, and your membership fee is fully tax deductible. Details <a href="http://www.machineproject.com/donate">on our support page</a>.</p>
</blockquote>Incidentally, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/arts/design/30fink.html?pagewanted=1">Machine Project was written up in the NYT recently</a>, and hey! Look at that. Boing Boing was also mentioned in the article.

And if you consider the ubiquitous traffic and holiday crowds, a leisurely morning spent baking breadsticks or whipping up a batch of homemade marshmallows seems positively Zen-like by comparison.

<p>1 Make a batch of grissini grissini (homemade breadsticks), flavored with rosemary or black pepper, wrapped in parchment paper and tied with a bow.

<p>2 Cut out cinnamon marshmallow stars with cookie cutters, then pack them, dusted with powdered sugar, into a tin.

<p>3 Pack a batch of cookbook author Paula Wolfert's prunes in Armagnac into a Mason jar. (Awesome over vanilla ice cream or crepes.) They'll be ready to eat in two weeks: You can include that on the "don't-open-until-Christmas" card.

<p>4 Make a batch of caramel sauce and pour it into a sterilized old vinegar jar or an antique bottle from a flea market.

<p>5 Stack a dozen shortbread cookies, flavored with lavender or a spice of your choice, wrap in tissue paper and tie with a ribbon.

<p>6 Make a batch of fudge with 70% cacao and stack the pieces in a tin lined with parchment paper. Wrap the tin with a page of newspaper that showcases the recipient's hobby or political bent.</blockquote>

But even without Drunk History or the Zach Galafianakis Absolut Vodka Ads, without Baby Preacher, Lil' Bill O'Reilly, or the kids rapping about the election to T.I.'s "Whatever You Like," and probably a dozen other honorable mentions, I feel confident that you will still find this to be a captivating, thorough, and most of all HEARTBREAKING tribute to this year in internet....&lt;br style="clear: both;"/&gt;

The announcement directly contradicts previous Government policy on term extension, and could disappoint many UK citizens hoping the UK will reject proposals currently being discussed at EU level to extend the copyright term. Back in 2006, the independent Gowers Review of Intellectual Property recommended against term extension.

If it turns out the UK Government are unwilling to reject the Directive, then it will be up to the European Parliament to see sense and vote it out when they come to consider it (likely next February).

These are my two Lenk torches. To the left is an alcohol-fired torch that's probably 50-75 years old. I occasionally use it to heat-shrink tubing, but it's difficult to maintain and liable to seriously burn you if you are not careful with it.
<p>
To the right is my Lenk LSP-180 combination soldering iron and mini-torch. It's one of my very favorite tools and I use it a for soldering wire connections in soldering iron mode and for heating and soldering brass and copper shapes in torch mode.

I'm a big fan of Noah Scalin's ambitious Skull-a-Day project, through which he crafts and posts a skull using a different medium every day. So I was delighted to get a review copy of SKULLS, the book adaptation of his website, which lavishly reproduces his expert photographs of his widely varied projects. Every one of these skulls is an artistic success, though some are better than others (I'm a big fan of the food-skulls like those shown below -- even the simple <a href="http://skulladay.blogspot.com/2007/07/46-soy-sauce-skull.html">Soy-Sauce Skull</a> is admirably well-executed given the volatility of the medium). It's always tricky to turn a website into a book, but this is a good one: in addition to the skulls and the brief artist's notes, there's a couple of appendices, one of which will teach to you make skulls from a variety of household objects, the other shows off some of the best fan-skulls Scalin inspired.

<a href="http://www.cry.org/mainapp/shop/donation.aspx">Child Rights and You</a>: I travelled to Mumbai earlier this year for research and was overwhelmed by the terrible, ubiquitous child poverty -- thousands and thousands of children, barefoot, disfigured, begging. I asked my Indian friends about it and was told that it was endemic to Mumbai and India in general, and that many children are exploited by desperate parents or criminal "pimps" who muscle them out of the majority of their earnings. As a new parent, I couldn't help but wonder again and again how I would feel if it were my child living in those circumstances. I'm no stranger to poverty -- I helped build schools with Nicaraguan refugees in Central America, worked to set up an NGO in sub-Saharan Africa -- but I'd never seen anything to rival this. On advice from my Indian friends, I investigated and made a donation to CRY (we also nominated them as a charity in lieu of presents for people who came to our wedding). CRY works to remedy the root causes of child poverty in India, in cities and the countryside, with a special emphasis on protecting girls from exploitation. The problem is deep and huge, but the solution has to begin somewhere.   CRY also maintains <a href="http://www.uk.cry.org/">a UK site</a> for British donors.

<img src="http://craphound.com/images/3083003280_01a3c03699.jpg"><br>

Pour a couple of cups of icing sugar (powdered sugar) into a bowl and stir in some cold water, a little at a time until you have a spreadable icing - don't make it too runny.
<p>
Spread onto the cupcake. Pop on the head and use a little of the icing to glue on the Smartie, hat and nose. Use the black icing tube for the eyes and buttons.

<p>Here are two things I like about this: (1) Chu believes science is real. (2) Chu believes climate change is real. <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/chu-autobio.html">Chu won</a> the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics. If you were at a Christmas party with him and the topic of discussion shifted to atomic physics, he would pwn your ass real fast.</p>
<p>But he is not a politician. This fact worries some in Washington, because one of his first and most important tasks in early 2009 will be a landmark energy reform bill.

<em>(Warning: the video embedded in this post contains graphic content that viewers may find disturbing.)</em><p><a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing tv</a> commemorates the 60th anniversary of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> this week in partnership with <a href="http://www.witness.org/">WITNESS</a>. Have you read the declaration lately? You can <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">do so here</a>. It is as timely and essential to our world today as it was on December 10, 1948, just after the end of World War II.<p>

WITNESS was founded by musician and activist <a href="http://www.petergabriel.com/">Peter Gabriel</a> with other human rights groups in 1992. They  use video and online media to open the eyes of the world to human rights violations. We'll be airing reports from the WITNESS archives this week, and tomorrow Boing Boing tv will present an interview with the organization's digital archivist, Grace Lile. She spoke with us about how WITNESS gathers videos like the one I'm embedding here, and why collecting and sharing this footage matters. She also tells us about the recently-launched <a href="http://hub.witness.org/">hub.witness.org</a>, which is a sort of gathering place for people who want to get involved. <p>
Today, as a special edition of <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/">BBTV WORLD</a>, we present a video from WITNESS that was produced by <a href="http://www.mdri.org/">Mental Disability Rights International</a> (MDRI) and the <a href="http://www.cejil.org/">Center for Justice and International Law</a> (CEJIL). With this video, they sought to "prevent continued unlawful acts that threaten the rights to life, liberty and personal security of two boys, Jorge, age 18, and Julio, age 17, and 458 others detained in the <a href="http://www.witness.org/index.php?option=com_rightsalert&Itemid=178&task=view&alert_id=22">Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital of Paraguay</a>." The two boys were detained in approximately six-by-six feet isolation cells, naked, and without access to bathrooms. Hospital staff said the boys have been detained in these conditions for the past four years.<p>
The video is deeply disturbing. I found it very painful to watch. But the producers, and the people behind WITNESS, hope that by documenting these abuses and making the documentation available to the world in this explicit form, we will be inspired to stop the abuse -- in this case, and in others around the world.<p>
