			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Counting non-stop, at one number a second, it would take you 31 years,<br />
251 days, 7 hours, 46 minutes, and 39 seconds to count to 1 billion.<br />
Here&#8217;s how I came up with that figure:</p>
<p>To count to 1 billion would take 999,999,999 seconds, because the<br />
timer would start as soon as the person says &#8220;one&#8221;, one second would<br />
have passed when the person says &#8220;two,&#8221; and so on.  [Thanks to Jacques<br />
de Wet for this observation.]</p>
<p>Now, there are 31557600 seconds in one year<br />
(seconds*minutes*hours*days). Divide 999,999,999 by that figure for<br />
the number of years.  Then divide the remainder (which has to be less<br />
then a year) by the number of seconds in a day for the number of days.<br />
If you keep doing this, eventually you get down to the number of<br />
minutes, and the remainder of that will give you the number of<br />
seconds.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business, like it or not wins or loses through <a href="http://self-help-and-motivation.com/general/self-help-and-motivation" target='_blank'>employee enthusiasm</a>. Achieving employee motivation is not easy. We are all different and all respond to varying situations in different ways. It is much more than employees doing their work properly. Employee motivation once generated in an organization is positive reinforcement. </p>
<p>Positive reinforcement is what builds our self-esteem. Employee motivation is the level of energy, commitment, and creativity that a company&#8217;s workers bring to their jobs. </p>
<p>Whether the economy is growing or shrinking, finding ways to motivate employees is always a management concern in any business. Employee motivation is a natural offshoot of employee empowerment. Higher management has a crucial role to play here.</p>
<p>Job enrichment has been a motivational technique which is receiving increased attention. Secondments, mentoring and standing-in for colleagues on leave are suggested methods of enlarging a job and increasing motivation.</p>
<p>Organizations desiring to improve employee motivation need a system in place that consistently rewards employee achievements. I&#8217;m always surprised how few organizations have such a system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many organizations are finding it quite a challenge to meet the growing needs of employees. Also the nature of employee needs have changed over time.</p>
<p>Though usually self-starters, the best employees typically require more from employers to remain motivated over time. A primary motivator for exceptional talent is having the ability to speak their minds in a free and unrestricted fashion, and develop their own <a href="http://www.fasttracknetworking.com/" target='_blank'>social networks</a>s. </p>
<p>Workshops and internal seminars may be seen by some as usurping the management role, or in danger of producing a company run by committee. But, done right this is a great motivator.</p>
<p>Employers often make use of this by presenting challenges to the employees. In making use of this type of employee motivation employers often include <a href="http://www.promotionalitems-freebies.com/" target='_blank'>incentive program</a>s such as a promotion or cash.</p>
<p>Employee motivation can sometimes be particularly problematic for small businesses, where the owner often has spent so many years building a company that he/she finds it difficult to delegate meaningful responsibilities to others. But entrepreneurs should be mindful of such pitfalls, for the effects of low employee motivation on small businesses can be devastating. Employee Motivation in the Workplace is important, and the job of a manager in the workplace is to get things done through employees. To do this the manager should be able to motivate employees.</p>
<p>Individuals as a general observation, will often have more difficulty understanding and valuing the motivators of others that are very different from their own. Improve staff knowledge of the other parts of your business, through cross division mentoring, improved social networking, and secondment, and individual employees become more successful. The team becomes much more than just the sum of its parts, and profitability will rise as well.</p>
<p>One top company which operates throughout the US recently set up an incentive program. At first those who promoted the idea met skepticism throughout higher management, but were allowed to get the project started. All were delighted when employees were enthusiastic about the incentive program and liked to be able to see how their individual contribution to the company earned awards. Over the course of the year, employee absenteeism was reduced by 75% and employee productivity (measured in call times, number of calls and customer service ratings) was increased by 43%.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.wandelendecoach.info" target="_blank">project management training</a> course will help anyone who needs to put together a plan to accomplish goals. Project management, in its simplest form, is the science of getting things done as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
<p>Though the options for online project management training are many, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it will be easy to find the right one for you. One good way to decide if a project management training course is of the quality that you need is if it leads to eligibility for certification. Though not everyone is interested in certification.</p>
<p>People who own small businesses and those who want to take project management training to enhance their job options may find price to be the reason they choose one program over another. There&#8217;s no problem with doing this providing that the coursework of the chosen institution is up to standard. When examining a less expensive program, see if they offer and refunds or guarantees down the road if you don&#8217;t feel they are giving you adequate training.</p>
<p>What content is desirable in a .project management training course? Curriculum of the course should include topics of management not only of people, but also of resources. Things to look for include both psychological training, as well as the actual workings of areas such as budgeting, communication, energy, and other related concrete topics. When analyzing potential project management programs look for the triad of scope, time and cost.</p>
<p>Self-motivated, internet-based learning works for some people, but many will be more successful in a conventional, highly structured classroom setting. A high quality project management training course will tailor to the student, not merely run through the topics. A conventional course may be more hassle than an online program, but it may help you acquire the necessary skills to successfully manage projects. Local universities and community colleges often charge reasonable prices for these classes.</p>
<p>While a project management training course is beneficial to business owners and managers, it is also beneficial as it may help create a career that is more rewarding, both personally and financially. Certified, experienced project managers can easily pull in up to $100 per hour, and potentially more, with demand ever increasing. A business degree coupled with a project management certification could be your ticket to great success.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a need to get things done should consider a project management training course. Project management is the skill and science of getting things done, in the most efficient and effective way possible. Though the options for online project management training are many, it may not be easy to find the right one for you. One way to decide if a project management training program is right for you is if it leads to eligibility for certification. Though not everyone is interested in certification, if the option is available it likely means that the course is a more complete one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What exactly is a change agent?  Generally, they handle organizational change initiatives very well.  To be less general, they tend to be a person tasked with creating needed employee behavior change.  This is a job that inevitably will involve a great deal of coordination between leadership functions.  They are often the person called on to manage upwards, handle communication, and generally to make change happen.</p>
<p>To understand the level of coordination that a change agent has to accomplish, it is necessary to be conscious of the fact that there are four separate leadership roles in larger organizations.  Typical for large businesses is an executive role, upper management, middle management and frontline management.  To achieve organization change, all four levels have to focused on the same change effort.</p>
<p>To pull this off, the change agent has to have comprehensive knowledge of every leadership role.  In addition, they have to specialized knowledge about change.  In many cases, the change agent’s position is all about keeping people on track.  When someone is falling down on the job at little at some level, the change agent jumps in to correct the problem.  This can be more complex than it seems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, change agents usually do not receive the authority to make organization change happen when they are told to do it.  By and large, they are not executives.  Change agents are typically volunteered for the change initiatives they are given.  This necessitates that they act as the wizard behind the curtain. Their duties can include choreographing action, arranging for demonstrations of executive support, and designing communication. It almost invariably demands extensive upward management.</p>
<p>The degree of upward management tends to hinge on the executive’s understanding of the difficulties inherent in organization change.  There is nothing unusual in an executive underestimating the difficulties of the changes they want.  If that’s the case the change agent may be faced with a lack of resources, an executive that doesn’t offer the necessary support and visibility, and a great deal of uncertainty whether there will be enforced compliance with the change demands.</p>
<p>When faced with this, the change agent needs to employ the full range of their diplomatic skills.  They need to get executive to want to demonstrate support an commitment to the project.  Not going after that needed support is foolish.  However, in the end, they must respect the executive and not overstep their own authority.  This is the potential trap of being a change agent.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memory strategies or ways to <a href="http://www.howtoimprovememory.org/improvememory01_19.php" target='_blank'>improve your memory</a> may seem like very complex procedures, and you may shy away from the whole process, just blaming the gazillion times you have misplaced your keys or forgotten to bring milk on your way home from work on your &lsquo;poor memory&rsquo;. </p>
<p>However, there are several fairly easy ways to improve your memory provided you have the willingness to do so. If you feel that memory loss is just a side effect of growing older and dismiss it, then memory strategies cannot really help you. However, if you take inspiration from older, wiser people who have very good memory despite being double your age, you can make a conscious effort to improve your memory.</p>
<p>Exercise Mind and Body</p>
<p>One of the simplest memory strategies is to lead a healthy lifestyle. Many research studies have shown that people that sleep well and eat a balanced diet have better memory. Those who exercise regularly pump more blood through the body and to the brain and hence have better ability to retain facts and figures. Conversely, people who live a lethargic lifestyle often put their retention ability &lsquo;on hold&rsquo; and do not feel they can remember dates and numbers and names so they don&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>Exercising your mind is also a great memory strategy by solving puzzles, playing games, reading and socializing. Sitting in front of the television cannot stimulate your brain as much as a book, a good conversation or a Sudoku puzzle can. If you have mastered a particular game, take it up a notch and go to more advanced levels so as to always challenge your brain and not let it be on rest mode</p>
<p>Associations</p>
<p>One of the most tried and tested memory strategy is to associate facts and figures with important events, pictures or other things so that you remember the <a href="http://www.howtoimprovememory.org/improvememory01_03.php" target='_blank'>memory associations</a> even if you don&rsquo;t remember the actual event. For instance if you always forget your daughter&rsquo;s wedding anniversary, associate the day with a holiday. Say she got married the day after Thanksgiving or a week before Easter; try to rely on the association as a memory strategy that will keep you up to date.</p>
<p>Visual Clues</p>
<p>If you want <a href="http://www.howtoimprovememory.org/improvememory01_09.php" target='_blank'>help to remember</a> something in the short term and do not have a piece of paper handy, try doing something unusual which when you&rsquo;ll see that will remind you of the original thing. For instance, if you have to remember to buy eggs on your way home from work, put a piece of candy or rubber band or any odd thing in your wallet. When you open your wallet to take out your train card or pay toll, you&rsquo;ll remember the eggs by seeing the piece of candy in an unusual place. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professional coaches have a very interesting and recently developed career path. They train executives and other people to perform to the best of their abilities, so that they can more effectively pursue goals for themselves and their companies. Most large corporations now use <a href="http://www.best-executive-coaching.info" target='_blank'>executive coaching</a>, as do a growing number of medium-sized and small businesses.</p>
<p>Today, industry spends over a billion dollars on executive coaching. There are more than forty thousand people employed in the field, and demand always outstrips the supply of available personnel. Most companies try to train their coaches internally to make sure of having people available, as well as to better manage the specific types of training that they need for their business.</p>
<p>Executive coaching used to be reserved for those who weren&#8217;t performing on the job up to expectations in an effort to increase their productivity and value as well as to retain them. Nowadays this coaching is more often utilized early on in the career in order to establish effective management at both management and executive levels of organizations. It is much easier to teach from the start what expectations are, then to try and undo bad habits that have been too long established.</p>
<p>Companies can hire coaches from many firms who specialize in coaching or hire individuals in private practice, but this is problematic. There are so many different kinds of training and even certifications and titles out there that one must almost be an expert to choose the best coaches. Anyone may simply call themselves a coach and open shop, and some certifications are meaningless.</p>
<p>If you do a quick search on an Internet search engine, you&#8217;ll find many companies which profess to train professional coaches in just a few days, resulting in a dubious certification certificate which comes automatically with payment.</p>
<p>Getting the specific coaching for a company or industry may be a tougher task then checking references and recommendations on coaches. It makes more sense for a company to send their staff members to executive coaching classes then to have them trained at the company. The insider coaches would know the industry as well as the company, as well as trained in coaching skills to be more effective.</p>
<p>Some companies do more than just train coaches for their own in-house coaching needs. They may also train them for lucrative outsourcing to other companies. Some large companies have stepped into this niche, providing a valuable service to companies who would like a steady supply of appropriately qualified coaches for their business without having to invest in creating their very own.</p>
<p>For executive couching development, there are many delivery options. Internet programs can be convenient, but still need to be well developed, reputable, and thorough. Free standing proprietary business schools are another option but may or may not be adequate for one&#8217;s needs. Programs at accredited community colleges or universities can probably provide the most reliability.</p>
<p>Today, industry spends over a billion dollars on executive coaching. There are more than forty thousand professional coaches employed in the field, and demand always outstrips the supply of available personnel. Most companies try to train their coaches internally to make sure of having people available, as well as to better manage the specific types of training that they need for their business. It is possible for companies to employ coaches from firms which specialize in that field, but this can be problematic. The vast range of certifications that exist in the marketplace can make it hard for these firms to properly narrow their focus.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your life is important! And not just to you.  When you get a life that is full of meaning and potential for even greater significance, you&#8217;re also better prepared to give share it with others in more meaningful and fulfilling ways.  Everybody benefits when you get a life!</p>
<p>L = Love; you get love by giving love.  Get more of it into your life today by giving more of it to more people in more ways.</p>
<p>I = Interest; curiosity is vital to experiencing life that goes beyond yourself.  You must exhibit interest in others and other things than yourself before they will truly become a part of your life.  When they do, they expand your personal possibilities well beyond whatever you could do on your own.</p>
<p>F = Fun; &#8220;all work and no play . . .&#8221; Also, try hard to make work fun, no matter what kind of work it is and no matter how much you may dislike it.  You experience fun from the inside out.  Fun is defined by the attitude you have toward the events of your life rather than by the events themselves.</p>
<p>E = Enthusiasm; Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Every great and commanding moment in the annals of the world is the triumph of some enthusiasm.”  Nothing great was ever accomplished without enthusiasm.  Think about your own accomplishments.  Weren&#8217;t they all the result of enthusiastic effort and dedication on your part?  At least those achievements that really matter in your life now were.</p>
<p>Get a L.I.F.E. and you&#8217;ll experience life beyond what you have so far.</p>
<p>Go for it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Preparing for a presentation with the use of visual aids can often overlook the obvious visual, You. That&#8217;s right! The speaker. Other forms of visual aids are just that, aids to help interpret your presentation. It is important that you are the main visual. Image is everything! </p>
<p>Focusing on the following areas will prepare you to be the main attraction. </p>
<p>Mental and Physical Preparation </p>
<p>Physical and mental preparation goes hand-in-hand. When you are nervous, your mind is usually racing, causing your words to jumble as they try to keep up with your thoughts. Physically slowing down your mind by relaxing your body helps eliminate this problem. Gather your thoughts through deep breathing and stretching to calm your nervousness. Mental imagery is a tool for a speaker to minimize or eliminate any negative thoughts or fears about speaking. Visualize that you are a dynamic and confident speaker who has valuable information to give. </p>
<p>Proper Attire </p>
<p>What is the first thing your audience will notice about you? Most likely it will be what you are wearing. Pay close attention to how your dress is representing you. Check with the event organizers to be sure that you won&#8217;t under or over dress. Do not wear anything that takes away from your presentation such as big jewelry, loud colors, or excessive makeup unless it is part of your presentation. </p>
<p>Body Language </p>
<p>1. Eye communication </p>
<p>The best way to use eye contact is to make eye contact! Do not overlook your audience when you are nervous. Find friendly faces and connect with the audience. This builds confidence in you as the audience senses your sincerity. You can use eye contact to seek feedback from your audience. Are they attentive and interested? </p>
<p>Too little eye contact is interpreted as being impolite and disinterested. Too much makes someone feel uncomfortable and victimized. Try to focus on connecting with your audience and eye contact will become comfortable. Article by <a href="http://www.www.anniegreeff.co.za/" target='_blank'>Professional Speaker</a></p>
<p>2. Gestures </p>
<p>Gestures should be natural and represent what you are feeling and thinking at that moment. If you are excited, and grand gestures are natural for you, go for it! Your audience appreciates sincerity verses a rehearsed robotic gesture. Although different countries and cultures define gestures differently, there are general gestures which convey a certain message to the audience. </p>
<p>Negative or closed gestures: </p>
<p>- Hands on the hips can be perceived as judgmental and authoritative. <br />- Hands in pockets show that you are nervous or complacent. <br />- Hands clasped behind you (reverse fig leaf or regal position) infer that you are hiding something, may cause distrust. This may also show nervousness. <br />- Hands clasped in front (fig leaf) convey tension. <br />- Crossed-arms may portray you as defensive and unopened. </p>
<p>Positive or open gestures: </p>
<p>- &#8220;At ease stance&#8221; (feet about shoulder width apart with toes pointed forward). <br />- Gestures should be appropriate and flowing, not quickly and jerky. <br />- Vary your gestures so that you do not bore the audience. <br />- Palms open show that you are non-threatening. <br />- Appear natural by matching your words, thoughts, and feelings to your gesture. </p>
<p>3. Posture and Movement </p>
<p>- Proximity and orientation. <br />- The social norm in North America is about one-and-one-half feet to four feet between two people. Standing too close to someone can cause them to feel uncomfortable and infringed on. Standing too far can cause them to feel disconnected and disinterested. <br />- Stances/movement - a neutral stance is usually best. Feet slightly shoulder width apart and toes forward. Movement is dependent on your situation. Pacing is distracting however, showing a visual by moving back and forth may be warranted. <br />- Head nodding can be perceived positively showing your audience that you are interested in them. It can also be perceived negatively if you are shaking your head in a disapproving or demeaning manner. Article by <a href="http://www.www.anniegreeff.co.za/" target='_blank'>Life Coach</a></p>
<p>4. Facial expressions </p>
<p>Be extremely aware of your facial expressions. Do your facial expressions convey a different meaning than what you are thinking or feeling? Or, are they conveying exactly what you are thinking or feeling (i.e. tiredness, boredom)? Always remember to smile at the audience. A good time to do this is when people are first coming into your session. Greet them with a smile. This helps relax you and helps the audience warm up to you before your formal presentation. It is easier to give a presentation in front of a relaxed and inviting crowd rather than a cold and judgmental one. </p>
<p>Remember, you may have the most dynamic presentation slide show with the latest technology, however, all that hard work will be discarded if you do not prepare yourself and the main visual. Make your next presentation a high-impact one with a lasting impression of YOU. </p>
<p>Happy Presenting! </p>
