			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>I mentioned <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/04/25/low-tech-pleasure-and-pain/">a while ago</a> that I was still carrying around an address book in my purse, and begged for suggestions for managing my contacts because things were getting totally out of hand. It&#8217;s been seven months since I wrote that post, and the situation has not improved! So I was excited to read the recent reviews of a couple of contact management apps by <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/28/soocial-the-best-address-book-youll-ever-use/#more-3867">Imran Ali</a> and <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/29/contacthero-vying-for-contact-management-dominance/">Aliza Sherman</a>.</p>
<p>I really like the look and features of <a href="http://www.contacthero.com/welcome">ContactHero</a>. As for <a href="http://www.soocial.com/">Soocial</a>, I didn&#8217;t play with it, but might be tempted to use their app for no reason other than the fact that they actually say &#8220;ungimp my contacts&#8221; and have a picture of David Hasselhoff in a Speedo on <a href="http://www.soocial.com/web-worker-daily">the WWD invite page</a>, both of which made me laugh and got them points for nerve and verve.</p>
<p>But then I realized why I haven&#8217;t made that leap yet, and why I probably won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m old-fashioned (well, when it comes to certain things, there&#8217;s no maybe about it), but I have to point out what I think is a fatal flaw in web-based contact management apps.</p>
<p>I am perfectly OK with storing information about myself, my projects, whatever, in the cloud. I take responsibility for what I might lose, or what might get into the hands of someone with wicked intent&#8230; I weigh the options and accept the risk. I don&#8217;t put clients&#8217; material up there. It doesn&#8217;t belong to me. And I don&#8217;t feel at all comfortable putting someone else&#8217;s address, birthday, and kids&#8217; names anywhere but on my computer&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, but I just don&#8217;t think I have the right to make that call.</p>
<p>Hate to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Downer">Debbie Downer</a>, but has this minor ethical question crossed anyone else&#8217;s mind?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a web worker like the rest of you, and my personal life is as Internet oriented as my professional life, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic or appropriate for us to expect the Internet to be a panacea. It&#8217;s not <em>always </em>the right solution.</p>
<p>So I have gone back to the drawing board and started looking again for a good, old-fashioned address book/contact management app I can download and install on my hard drive. So far, no luck. Of the apps I&#8217;ve looked at, the UIs are horrific and they just aren&#8217;t slick enough. (Note to developers: users are getting pretty demanding these days. We&#8217;re being spoiled by things that look and work beautifully, like iPods and anything Ajax&#8230;)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want a productivity tool, don&#8217;t need a calendar. I&#8217;ve got all that covered. All I want is a way to organize my contacts.</p>
<p><em>Is this too much to ask? </em></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t I have a desktop address book app that will allow me to enter and import data <em>and </em>scan a biz card if I feel like it (with OCR even)? One that will allow me to upload a photo? Schedule birthday and follow-up alerts? And I want it to be clean and pretty. I want dragging and dropping. Must have a &#8220;Notes&#8221; field where I can write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Ws">the five Ws</a> if necessary.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t want groups or categories, I want <em>tags</em>! Some of my contacts have to do with my translating, some with my tech writing, some with my blogging, some with my project (and within that category there are artists, investors, legal experts, developers, and more&#8230;). Many of my contacts are in one or more of those categories and they&#8217;re francophiles too. Sometimes I just need to reach the francophiles. (<a href="http://www.francophilia.com/">I&#8217;m serious</a>.) I <em>need </em>tags. And can I have a widget too? I have a PC, but not for much longer&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Santa Claus</span> ContactHero, please bring me an address book for my laptop. I&#8217;ve been mostly good.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><a href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/parallelsvmware.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5045" title="parallelsvmware" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/parallelsvmware.png?w=225&#038;h=99" alt="parallelsvmware" width="225" height="99" /></a>Any freelancer who does computer-related work, whether on or offline, probably understands the value of being able to work in multiple operating systems. That goes double for web workers, who need to know that what they produce behaves no matter who’s looking at it, or what they look at it with. Enter virtualization software.</p>
<p>I’m a Mac user, but I don’t absolutely despise all other platforms.</p>
<p>Windows, for me, is like that black sheep uncle who can’t seem to do anything right, but who’s also sometimes the most fun member of the family. XP, that is. I’ve tangoed with Vista, but I still prefer XP, and it’s well-suited to use in virtualized machines. A lighter memory footprint, less flair, and more stability make it the perfect companion for either Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion.</p>
<p>If you read my post earlier this week on <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/11/vmware-fusion-2-vs-parallels-desktop-4-lets-dance/" target="_self">TheAppleBlog</a>, you know that my initial verdict sided with Fusion 2 over Parallels 4. Reasons for my decision included ease of use, OS X integration, and video performance.</p>
<p>As a web worker, the criteria for what constitutes good software is different, so I’m going to examine Windows-specific tools, and their performance under both virtualization platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Dependability</strong></p>
<p>If you’re going to be using any app in a virtualized environment, a key consideration is the stability of the program running the guest OS.</p>
<p>In my brief time with the two programs, only Parallels has given me reason to question its reliability. When viewing the exact same content in Internet Explorer in both it and Fusion (running the exact same version of Windows installed from the same source), Parallels’ IE crashed twice while Fusion had no problems. In terms of macro issues, Parallels again loses points, since it was the only of the two to experience a system-wide freeze, which only a hard reset would correct.</p>
<p><strong>Office</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5034" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 617px"><a href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/word.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5034" title="word" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/word.png?w=607&#038;h=379" alt="word" width="607" height="379" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fusion on the left, Parallels on the right</p></div>
<p>Say what you like about Microsoft Office, sometimes it’s all clients want to see, even if you advise against it. And yes, OS X has Office 2008, but it still seems to me like they handicapped the program somewhat to push customers in the general direction of Windows and Office 2007. In a head to head performance test, Word 2007 ran superbly in the Parallels virtual machine, showing only infrequent odd visual effects (skips, slight lag) when windows were resized, fullscreened, and moved around in Coherence mode.</p>
<p>A minor point, but for icon snobs, the Word icon in the dock showed less pixilation than that of Word in Fusion. The Fusion installation also displayed more unusual visual effects when resizing and moving the application window. Parallels also gets major points for syncing your documents folder and desktop, meaning that I didn’t have to drag any files to the virtual machine. On the other hand, if you do have to do a file transfer, Parallels is sluggish and sub-par by comparison. For Office virtualization, Parallels takes top honors.</p>
<p><strong>Chrome and IE</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5038" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 617px"><a href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/wwd-chrome.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5038" title="wwd-chrome" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/wwd-chrome.png?w=607&#038;h=379" alt="Fusion on the left, Parallels on the right" width="607" height="379" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fusion on the left, Parallels on the right</p></div>
<p>Being able to run Windows-only browsers is key when making sure that webpages display properly in all setups.</p>
<p>Chrome has loads of useful functions for teleworkers, not the least of which is the ability to save sites as Applications. Having access to Web 2.0 apps without browser clutter is not only convenient, it also saves time and money that might otherwise be lost to procrastination. With decent specs and using Unity for Fusion or Coherence for Parallels, you can pretend you already have a fully functional OS X release of Chrome.</p>
<p>In both programs, Chrome runs smoothly, supports fullscreening, and performs snappily. All of the features are there, including tabs running for separate processes, which has saved me a lot of rework when a single instance has failed. Saving a Campfire room and WordPress dashboard as application shortcuts worked fine as well, but here roles were reversed regarding window lag and movement issues, with Fusion delivering the better performance of the two. Parallels does automatically make a shortcut on your OS X desktop, though, which is handy in a pinch. Internet Explorer also performed admirably in both settings, but it should be noted that in my early tests, IE crashed twice while trying to view Quicktime content.</p>
<p><strong>General Issues</strong></p>
<p>Both Fusion and Parallels demonstrated that they still have their fair share of kinks to work out. Parallels, for instance, wouldn’t let me drag windows to my second monitor in Coherence mode, while Fusion had no trouble making the jump. That’s nearly a dealbreaker, since I can see how quickly it would become tiresome to have to switch to windowed mode to move the application between screens whenever you needed to do so. The mirrored folder feature in Parallels is nice, but you can also set it up in Fusion, it’s just not on by default.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>Though both have programs have room for improvement, I have to side with Fusion again in this extended test, since most of the features which it lacks when compared to Parallels can actually be turned on. Plus, dependability and multi-monitor support when in OS integration mode are absolutely crucial in a multi-OS workflow, so it’s hard to side with Parallels until a later build delivers more stability and bug fixes.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/" target="_self">Fusion 2</a> and <a href="http://www.parallels.com/" target="_self">Parallels Desktop 4</a> now for $79.99 each. Fusion 2 is a free upgrade for users of the original program, while owners of Parallels 3 can upgrade for $39.99.</p>

The other day, in fact, I set a personal record with 11.5 hours of them in a single work day (and I had the sore headphone ear and hoarse voice that came along with that feat).  Despite this meeting load, I still had to respond to IM&#8217;s, reply to a multitude of emails, prepare slides early in the day for a presentation later on, and a host of other tasks.  That begs the question:</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you effectively multitask in meetings in a way that lets you get work done?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>When you can and when you can&#8217;t</strong></p>
<p>First, you have to recognize where the multitasking opportunities are.  Obviously, when you are presenting a set of slides or walking through some code to an audience, doing anything else is next to impossible.  On the other end of the spectrum, if you were invited to provide details that might not even get covered to a broad group, there&#8217;s a decent chance you won&#8217;t say anything beyond introducing yourself at the top of the meeting.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the agenda shown at the beginning of the meeting.  If you don&#8217;t have a copy of it, take a quick screen shot of it when it flashes by on whatever desktop sharing mechanism you are using if you can, as that will be your roadmap to multitasking potential.  Take note not only of the segments where your opinion might possibly come up, but also be sure to mentally check back into the meeting every 2-3 minutes so you can assess where in the agenda things stand.  That decreases the chances you&#8217;ll be caught off guard by a question when you weren&#8217;t paying attention because you were doing something else.</p>
<p><strong>Short Tasks</strong></p>
<p>David Allen&#8217;s Getting Things Done approach to task management is ideal for meeting multitasking since it breaks things down into short time segments.  In using this method, whenever something comes into your inbox you assess whether or not it is something you need to keep for reference, something you can delete, something you can delegate to someone else, something you can take care of in less than 2 minutes, or something that needs a longer period of your time.  Everything except that last category can be processed in the 2-3 minute time slice you create for yourself during portions of your meeting that aren&#8217;t as relevant to you as other segments.</p>
<p>Whatever task management tactics you use, there are always quick hitting items that need attention.  Taking care of them while on a meeting where you can multitask keeps them from intimidatingly piling up.</p>
<p><strong>Stop and Start Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Some longer tasks lend themselves to being stopped and started in manageable intervals that can match up with those 2-3 minute segments you&#8217;ve carved out for yourself while the meeting is going on.  Maybe you have some long technical article to read through that lends itself to stopping every few paragraphs to check back in with your teleconference.  When a slide presentation needs to be prepared for later in the day, stopping after each slide is done so you can assess how far the meeting has progressed is another example.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Small Physical Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Paper filing, desk cleaning, reloading your beverage if you have a wireless phone &#8212; these things are primarily physical rather than mental, and lend themselves to being done while you listen to your meeting.  That&#8217;s not to say you should go dig the ditch for a new sprinkler line in your back yard while on the phone, but smaller things around the desk are ripe for multitasking.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What to do when you get caught</strong></p>
<p>Make no mistake, if you frequently try to multitask during meetings you will eventually get caught.  Someone will ask you a question and, because you were off multitasking, you won&#8217;t know what that question was.  There are good and bad ways to recover from this situation.</p>
<p>Some will tell you to feign ignorance (&#8221;I don&#8217;t quite understand what you mean, can you rephrase the question?&#8221;).  Others will tell you to pass the buck to someone else on the call (&#8221;I&#8217;m not quite the expert on that topic that Anakin is, what do you think Ani?&#8221;)  However, the best way is to simply cop to it, but be careful about how you choose your words.  There is a big difference between:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I wasn&#8217;t paying attention, can you repeat that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you caught me multitasking on something else for a meeting with my boss later today, can you repeat that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Both make you look bad, but the latter makes you look <em>less </em>bad.  And that&#8217;s the risk you run when trying to multitask: the possibility you could look bad on your current meeting weighed against the cost of not getting as many things done throughout your business day.  If you approach multitasking opportunities with a plan, though, you can mitigate that risk and be more productive.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Is mobile online conferencing on smartphones poised to become a killer app? There are some efforts to make it so, even though some may question whether the size of the displays on phones and other issues make the success of such applications prohibitive.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3177/3025307565_a9c454ec49_o.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="38" /></p>
<p>PC World has an <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/153703/coming_soon_to_your_smart_phone_web_conferencing.html">interesting piece</a> up on a startup called <a href="http://www.phonetopp.com/">PhoneTopp</a>, focused on full online meeting features for multiple devices, including the iPhone. Meanwhile, Global IP Solutions has a videoconferencing client that multiple providers can offer for Windows Mobile phones, in addition to plans for other platforms.</p>
<p>PhoneTopp is working on software and services to allow conferencing, whiteboarding and more online meeting features on BlackBerries, the iPhone, and Windows Mobile handsets. Users will be able to use Adobe Connect, Microsoft Live Meeting, and WebEx conferencing services. PC World is running some <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/153703/coming_soon_to_your_smart_phone_web_conferencing.html ">interesting screenshots</a> of how this might look horizontally on the iPhone.</p>
<p>The shots show PhoneTopp working with PowerPoint presentations, and how chat windows and combining voice will work with presentations. According to the PC World item, PhoneTopp services will cost about $8 per month per meeting participant&#8211;not too much to pay for those who do a lot of on-the-fly online meetings.</p>
<p>Global IP Solutions is taking a <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/16/20081013/ttc-video-conferencing-comes-to-mobiles-6315470.html">slightly different approach</a> to facilitating videoconferencing on smartphones. Its Video Engine Mobile client for Windows Mobile handsets is mainly aimed at carriers and handset suppliers who want to offer mobile videoconferencing as an option. The company intends to deliver similar clients for Symbian and the iPhone.</p>
<p>These broad-based efforts to facilitate full online meetings and videoconferencing, of course, complement some of the smartphone videoconferencing solutions already arriving, such as <a href="http://www.twomobile.com/content/100/103/C3340/">PacketVideo&#8217;s offerings</a> for the Nokia Series 60 platform. In a down economy, especially if, say, a full-blown WebEx meeting can look good on smartphones, these applications are likely to improve and possibly do well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Six years ago, when I wanted to make a conference call involving five participants, Bell Canada wanted to charge me $0.55 per minute per participant, resulting in a $165 cost for a one hour call. All those participants had to be in North America and a conference call operator was involved. The moderator could try to &#8220;chair&#8221; the session but there were limited ways to actually manage who spoke. Any archiving of the session would rely on participants&#8217; handwritten or typed notes.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Calliflower" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/calliflowerlogo225px.jpg?w=225&#038;h=68" alt="" width="225" height="68" />Flash forward to today: <a title="Iotum Website" href="http://www.iotum.com/" target="_blank">iotum</a> has analyzed the entire set of processes required for managing and moderating a voice conference call from scheduling and invitation to final archiving of the call for future reference. And they have researched today&#8217;s communications infrastructure, including web services and low cost voice connections.</p>
<p>They have executed on iotum CEO and co-founder Alec Saunders&#8217; <a title="Voice 2.0 Manifesto" href="http://saunderslog.com/voice-20/" target="_blank">Voice 2.0 Manifesto</a>. Today they are announcing the launch of their enhanced <a title="Calliflower Website" href="http://www.calliflower.com/" target="_blank">Calliflower Conference Call </a>service - a fully interactive, complete voice conference call service that has been in beta for over a year.</p>
<p>From <a title="Calliflower Launch - SaundersLog" href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/11/12/calliflower-goes-mobile-on-iphone/" target="_blank">Alec&#8217;s launch post on SaundersLog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users have told us that their overwhelming unmet need was not to have another point solution, but to have a single tool that could manage these complex Active Conversations. And when we looked at the market, most of the innovations being introduced are actually isolated features in search of integration solution — coordination, the audio call itself, document sharing, and text messaging to name a few examples.</p></blockquote>
<p>Originally developed as <a title="Calliflower via Facebook" href="http://apps.facebook.com/calliflower/" target="_blank">a Facebook application</a>, they recently provided <a title="Calliflower Portal Access" href="https://apps.calliflower.com/" target="_blank">direct Calliflower portal access</a> from the web. With <a title="Calliflower Press Release" href="http://www.iphonebuzz.com/calliflower-brings-easy-interactive-conference-calling-to-the-iphone-115142.php" target="_blank">today&#8217;s announcements</a> CalliFlower is offering Premium services such as document sharing, enhanced worldwide &#8220;local&#8221; calling access and business administrator support. To top off their announcement, Calliflower goes mobile with an iPhone application that provides full access to these calls.</p>
<p>So what comprises the complete interactive conference call experience?</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the call: Scheduling and invitations. Reminders via SMS or email. Low cost or free access for participants. Identification of participants calling in via either a PIN number or mobile number callerID.</li>
<li>During the call: A call-specific web page that displays an agenda, call participants, an interactive chat window, while allowing hand raising, muting, call recording and document sharing.</li>
<li>After the call: not only is the recording archived but also the entire call web page for recall of, say, URL&#8217;s given out in the chat window or the recording itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost to participants? Simply the cost of reaching an access point.</p>
<p>Previously the Calliflower calls could be reached by calling a number in Minnesota or France using the PSTN, SkypeOut or a couple of other softphone VoIP services. Going forward iotum will also be using <a title="Voxbone One Numb er for the World" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/12/one-number-for-worldwide-local-access-becoming-a-reality" target="_blank">Voxbone&#8217;s newly launched iNum service</a>, initially providing free access to a +883 number from any of <a title="Voxbone SP Partners" href="http://inum.net/what-is-inum/inum-partners/" target="_blank">Voxbone&#8217;s iNum Service Provider Partners</a> or via 55 iNum local access points worldwide.</p>
<p>The heart of the Calliflower service is its use of dynamic interactive web services as the backbone to the features described above.</p>
<p>During the call all participants can access the call&#8217;s web page &#8220;portal&#8221; for a fully interactive call experience as described above. The moderator can mute individual participants when the kids are crying or dogs are barking in the background. Having used the service many times during the beta period I found the combination of the web page&#8217;s feature set changes the overall dynamics of a conference call and significantly enhances the participants&#8217; conference call experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/callifloweriphone01180px.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4986" title="callifloweriphone01180px" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/callifloweriphone01180px.jpg?w=180&#038;h=270" alt="callifloweriphone01180px" width="180" height="270" /></a>Once completed the call recording and web page are available for recall by any of the participants or anyone else registered with Calliflower who may want to review the call. Recordings can be inserted into websites or weblogs, such as Alec does with <a title="SquawkBox Posts" href="http://saunderslog.com/category/squawkbox/" target="_blank">his SquawkBox Conference Calls</a> that periodically discuss technology industry developments.</p>
<p>The iPhone application (available shortly at the Apple App Store) provides full access to your calls, whether scheduled, during a call or in the past. Past call recordings and chat walls can be readily listened to or read. One &#8220;future&#8221; feature that that still requires development is the creation of calls from the iPhone.</p>
<p>Basic Calliflower Conference Calls will be free; while the Premium service is priced at the special introductory price of $50 per month, for two organizers, with a no-risk 30-day free trial period, until Jan. 1, 2009. Additional organizers cost $25 per month each.</p>
<p>We have seen the rise of many conference calling services over the past year, based on lower cost communications network architectures incorporating VoIP. However, typically they simply make the call connections or have a limited set of features. Having used the beta Calliflower service many times over the past 12 months I have been able to witness its evolution into this complete interactive voice and web service resulting in a unique conference call participant experience (and there are still a few nifty features to come).</p>
<p>My costs for accessing these many calls over the past few years: the <a title="SkypeOut subscription" href="http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/subscriptions/#uscaSubscriptionTab" target="_blank">$2.95 per month SkypeOut subscription charge</a> (which lets me also make unlimited calls to within North America). And I never need a PIN code; Calliflower recognizes that <a title="Skype CallerID" href="http://skypejournal.com/blog/2008/06/finally_skype_callerid_for_nor_1.html" target="_blank">my SkypeOut CallerID is also my registered mobile phone number CallerID</a>. This allows me to also access Calliflower calls from my BlackBerry using <a title="Carrier Friendly iSkoot" href="http://skypejournal.com/blog/2008/04/iskoot_providing_carrier_frien.html" target="_blank">iSkoot</a> which cannot recognize touch tones required for PIN numbers.</p>
<p>Definitely worth giving it a try, not simply for the cost saving but especially for the value-add it brings to the entire conference call user experience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><img src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/img-flypaper.png?w=199&#038;h=85" alt="Flypaper Logo" width="199" height="85" align="right" />Using Flash based content for your sales, marketing or training can be an effective and impressive way to present your message.  It can also be expensive.  When the content you created last month needs tweaking, it&#8217;s back to the developer to program your changes.</p>
<p><a title="Flypaper - Home" href="http://flypaper.com">Flypaper</a> wants to change that by providing tools that allow the general business user the ability to create and share rich content without the need for programming.</p>
<p>Flypaper is a Windows based application that makes creating Flash Content possible without the typical time and expense of hiring a developer.</p>
<p>Using just about any media content, you can create Flypaper Stories that aren&#8217;t just presentational, they can even be interactive and gather form data from your viewer.</p>
<p>Some examples on their site include everything from interactive sales <a title="Flypaper - Presentations" href="http://www.flypaper.com/showcase/default.aspx?subCont=0">presentations</a> and <a title="Flypaper - Brochures" href="http://www.flypaper.com/showcase/personal.aspx?subCont=0">brochures</a> to portfolios and even fun things like a collection of <a title="Flypaper - Top 10 Favorite Sketches" href="http://www.flypaper.com/showcase/detail.aspx?pageId=62">Top 10 Monty Python Sketches</a>.</p>
<p>Where Flypaper really pays off is that it is super easy to edit and reuse your stories.  Make changes and revisions quickly so you can customize your content for a particular event or audience.</p>
<p>The creation process is very visual, sort of a cross between creating PowerPoint or Keynote slides and video editing. There is no code and no programming, but I would describe it as being very object oriented.</p>
<p><img src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/img-flypaper-use.png?w=450&#038;h=324" alt="Flypaper Interface" width="450" height="324" /></p>
<p>Everything that you create or add to a story has properties that define its appearance and behavior.  If you create a page, you set the properties of that page.  Add a button to the page and the interface changes to allow you to set the properties of that button. It is a very logical building block sort of approach and it works very well.</p>
<p>Creating branches in your stories to allow for user choice is really simple and a Story Map shows you how your pages fit together.</p>
<p>The Flybrary tool allows you to not only create libraries of your photos and other assets but it contains a bunch of sample templates and components that you can use in your own stories.  It is also web enabled so you can search Flickr and other photo sites directly from Flypaper and drag and drop the content right in. (Be sure to check usage licenses on photos and other items found on the web)</p>
<p>When your story is created you can post it on the Flypaper.net or your own personal hosting site, or export to various formats including movies, executables  or even SCORM e-learning courses.  The Dashboard lets you view statistics on your stories, know what was viewed down to the page level.</p>
<p>I found Flypaper to be relatively easy to use, and the drag and drop functionality sure makes the process pretty simple.  It will still take some time to create a fully featured professional looking presentation though.  And there is still no shortcut for writing good copy and preparing compelling content.</p>
<p>Flyaper is a Windows only app but it should run well in Parallels or similar on the Mac.</p>
<p>A <a title="Flypaper - Trial Download" href="http://www.flypaper.com/download/default.aspx">30-day trial</a> is available, after which the app and access to your flypaper.net account will normally run you $249, although there is special offer in place now for $195.</p>
<p><em>Would Flypaper make it easier for you to use Flash Content in your marketing? </em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>The addition of <strong><a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/11/11/google-rolls-out-gmail-voice-and-video-chatslowly/">Gmail Voice and Video Chat</a></strong> to Google&#8217;s list of services brought back to mind a question I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a while: have we gone past the saturation point in having different ways to chat with people? Even if you count only real-time ways to talk to people, there are a pile of instant messaging applications, more audio chat options and conference call providers than you can shake a stick at, and video options including Skype, Oovoo, and Gmail - to name a few.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not to mention just walking down the hall to talk to someone in person, which is not an option for a lot of web workers.</p>
<p>So, given all the choices: which ones do <em>you</em> actually use to communicate with friends, family, clients, and co-workers? And how do you decide? Is it technical superiority, multi-platform availability, installed base, or something else? Do you find different chat tools work better for different tasks or types of conversations? Or are you firmly stuck in a model where realtime chat wastes your time, and you settle for email, or picking up the telephone when you really need to talk to someone?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>When clients call you and hear a baby cooing or a kitten meowing in the background, they can&#8217;t help but remember that you&#8217;re human.  You&#8217;re not just an invisible web working slave that does their bidding.  You have a life, a family, and pets.  Your clients know this because they can hear voices and home background noise <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/11/07/do-you-charge-for-your-phone-time/">when they call you</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not always advantageous that your clients hear background noise during calls or voice chat sessions.  Especially if you have a rooster.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule your client calls. </strong></p>
<p>I mentioned my pet rooster again because he produces the loudest noise here at home.  I used to have an absolute look of terror when I&#8217;m on Skype with a client and he would start crowing.  I wrote <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/09/efficient-web-working-for-the-pet-owner/">in a previous post here at WWD</a> that I worked around this problem by scheduling my work tasks around the time when my pets are asleep. This allows me to call up clients without worrying about any noises the neighbors or pets might make.</p>
<p>Scheduling is also beneficial if your clients are the ones initiating calls.  This tends to make both parties more productive. Clients can batch requests or comments rather than calling you every time they think of something new.  You can also spend more time on the work itself, rather than answering the phone all day.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve determined your schedule, don&#8217;t forget to notify the other people in your house.  Let them know the hours where interruptions and noises are discouraged.  If you have a designated home office space, you can also put up signs outside your door to tell others that you are not to be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize calls</strong></p>
<p>Another technique that seems to work is to minimize client calls in the first place.  Web workers who have a noisy work environment will benefit from this approach.</p>
<p>Of course, some clients need more &#8216;phone time&#8217; than others.  These are the clients that you should call more often.  Those clients who are heavy tech users might prefer daily email reports that they can check and read whenever they want.  These people tend to be minimalist in their communication style.  I have one client that I&#8217;ve worked with for years, and I&#8217;ve never had to call him.  He sees calls as a waste of time and judges me solely based on the quality of my work.  (But this doesn&#8217;t excuse him from receiving greeting cards from me once in a while!)</p>
<p><strong>Think outside the office</strong></p>
<p>Just because you have a home office, it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to stay there all the time.  A colleague of mine lived near a construction site, which made it impossible for him to make calls during the day.  Since talking to clients at night wasn&#8217;t an option for him, he would head to a quiet coffee shop during less busy hours and receive/make client calls from there.  If going out isn&#8217;t an option either, find another room in the house where you can communicate with your clients without noisy interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>How about creating background noise?</strong></p>
<p>InventorSpot <a href="http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_thriving_office_busy_office_sounds_disguise_work_home_19442">recently reviewed two CDs containing busy office background noise</a>.  The idea is that you should play the CDs when you&#8217;re on the phone with a client, so that they&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re working in a busy office rather than a home office.</p>
<p>While the concept behind these CDs is interesting, I feel that they are a bit misleading.  First of all, unless I&#8217;m communicating with a client on behalf of my content writing team, I make them aware that I am working alone.</p>
<p>Admitting this never seemed detrimental to the client&#8217;s perception of me.  The benefits of this arrangement must always be mentioned upfront, even indirectly.  Don&#8217;t say that you are “just” a freelance worker who “only” works at a home office.  Using phrasing like this shows the client the low esteem you have for your style of working.  Let them know that because you do the work by yourself, you give them the personal, one-on-one customer service they need.  This means they don&#8217;t waste time being passed around from manager to manager until they get the answers or action they want.</p>
<p>Presenting yourself as a fully staffed company rather than a solo contractor can also raise different expectations.  They might demand more work than you can deliver, with a turnaround time that seems impossible.  If they absolutely need this type of delivery, you can call or hire other freelancers and work as a team.  This is where your network of independent contractors may come in handy.<br />
<em><br />
Is it hard for you to talk to clients over the phone when you&#8217;re in your home office?  Do you think it makes you seem unprofessional?</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>It’s 5 o’clock on a Thursday afternoon and you managed to get through airport security on your way home, with half an hour to spare to check your e-mail and make phone calls. But your electronic device of choice is low on power.</p>
<p>Do you know where to find an outlet to recharge and work before your flight leaves?</p>
<p>If you’re a member of an airline club or fly first- or business-class you probably have nothing to worry about. The airport lounges for those who can afford them offer some privacy, with cubicles for working and phoning. Here’s one guide to <a href="http://www.frequentflyer.oag.com/airlines_airports/clubs.asp">airline-operated clubs worldwide</a>. <a href="http://www.prioritypass.com/">Priority Pass</a> is a program that gives you access to clubs and lounges worldwide for an annual fee.</p>
<p>But that’s not an option for most of us, considering the number of weary business travelers you see around airport gates, often sitting on the floor against a wall or pillar, working away. Those people have found a power source, and some I’ve seen adopt the hard stare of someone willing to fight to keep it.</p>
<p>For the most part, finding power in an airport is accomplished by trial-and-error, and is frequently harder than getting a WiFi connection. Many airports worldwide make connections available, either free or for a fee of  $7 to $10 a day, throughout their terminals.</p>
<p>For power, you learn which airlines have stations near gates with multiple outlets where you can plug in. Southwest has more of those than most airlines, in my experience. Some JetBlue gate areas also have them. Logically enough, several airlines at the San Jose, Calif., airport have stations in their gate areas.</p>
<p>There is not much information on the web to help you if you’re in unfamiliar airport.</p>
<p>One source is a WiKi on Microsoft manager Jeff Sandquist’s personal blog, appropriately named <a href="http://airpower.jeffsandquist.com/">airpower</a>. Looking at airpower, however, reveals the difficulty of the task. Typical of the entries is one for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gate A 18: on the pole near the women&#8217;s restroom (2 outlets) - chair close by!</p></blockquote>
<p>An entry for the Frankfurt, Germany, airport reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second Floor, Beside the emergency exit next to McDonalds. Behind the table a bit away from the McDonalds itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the information is very helpful as far as it goes but may be incomplete. Is that table still in the same place at the Frankfurt McDonalds?</p>
<p>Often the only way to find a working outlet at the airport and in the concourse you need to use is to prowl around in gate areas that aren’t occupied or where the crowd is small, or in common areas just past security checkpoints.</p>
<p>Think of places where the cleaning crew would logically need to plug in equipment. Look behind chairs, on pillars and around airline ticketing podiums.</p>
<p>Another possibility is at airports where not all of the pay phones have been ripped out. At Philadelphia International, I have found that at least some cubicle-like booths with a seat and a small shelf (D Concourse) have outlets – an apparent leftover from the days when access to a landline was needed to use a laptop.</p>
<p>If all else fails, consider doing what one frequent flier I read about a couple of years ago does: Carry a short extension cord with a three-outlet adapter. If you find someone using the only outlet in sight, ask them to share.</p>
<p><em>If you have experience with this problem, and information to share, please let us have it.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://mail.google.com/videochat">Google just launched video and voice chat</a> today for both PC and Mac. My first reaction? That is so cool.</p>
<p>The only problem is the announcement went out before they had actually activated many accounts. Including mine. Luckily, I had the email address of the Google contact who sent out the announcement, and he spent some time troubleshooting with me. First order of business? Getting my email account activated as well as that of my initial Gmail voice and video chat guinea pig, Scott from Alaska HDTV (@alaskapodshow on Twitter).</p>
<p>After about an hour, Scott still could not see the video options in his Gmail chat box. While he and I continued to restart browsers and compare notes, I received a text chat message from my friend Kris, a multimedia producer and documentary filmmaker in Brooklyn (@krisbritt on Twitter). She had seen my Tweets about my attempts to test out the new Gmail voice and video chat.</p>
<p>I invited her to video chat and within moments and after just a few rings, the video chat window opened, and there was Kris. The picture was clear, the sound was clear.</p>
<p>Right away I thought &#8220;This is much better than Skype.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love Skype, but it can fizzle and pop now and then.  WWD blogger Samuel Dean also tested Gmail voice and video chat and points out that it falls short compared to Skype because it doesn&#8217;t connect calls to landlines and doesn&#8217;t offer voice mail. It does, however, allow you to record a video chat. Ah, the possibilities!</p>
<p>Right away, Kris echoed my feelings that Gmail voice and video chat is convenient and a great addition to the Google suite of tools - perfect, for example, to use while reviewing a Google Doc with someone else. Having video and voice chat within Gmail also means you&#8217;ll get more functionality with less open applications and windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/alaskahdtv-chat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-405 alignleft" title="Gmail voice and video chat " src="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/alaskahdtv-chat.jpg?w=231&#038;h=300" alt="Gmail voice and video chat " width="231" height="300" align="left" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Some quick things to know before you dash off to download the video chat add-on for your browser:</strong></p>
<p>1. Your account must be activated by Google for video, and this could take a few more days.</p>
<p>2. Your chat friend must have Gmail voice and video chat add-on installed for it to work. Otherwise they will be directed to the download page for the add-on.</p>
<p>3. You can tell if a friend is video-chat enabled by a little video camera icon to the left of their name on the contacts Chat List in your Gmail account.</p>
<p>4. You can invite someone to video chat with the Video Options button at the bottom of the chat box.</p>
<p>5. You can pop out the video into it&#8217;s own window and move it around as well as open it to full screen.</p>
<p>One possible software conflict? The latest Flash player may interfere with the proper installation of the video add-on (this is just a guess from Scott who eventually switched computers and was able to video chat immediately).</p>
<p>Troubleshooting tips? Make sure your browser is closed before you install the add-on. Then you may have to restart your browser a few times until it takes. Just something anecdotal. Probably not in the manual.</p>
<p><em>Have long did it take to get Gmail voice and video chat  to work for you? What do you think you&#8217;ll use it for?</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/11/parallels-desktop-40-for-mac-now-available/">From The Apple Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Virtualization software has come a long way since the days of Virtual PC on PPC Macs. Microsoft’s Windows-enabling program was more of a parlor trick than fully functional software. These days, Parallels Desktop version 4.0, <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">available today for purchase</a>, makes running a virtual machine more of a pleasure and less of a chore.</p>
<p>Earlier this fall, VMWare Fusion, the primary competitor of Parallels, released version 2.0 of their software. VMWare’s updated product added DirectX 9.0c and Mac OS X Leopard Server support, features which gave it a significant edge over the 3.0 release of Parallels. Parallels Desktop 4.0 evens the field, introducing both DirectX 9 and OpenGL 2.1 support, and the ability to run OS X Leopard Server.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/11/parallels-desktop-40-for-mac-now-available/">about the rest of Parallel 4&#8217;s new features</a>, as well as <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/11/11/vmware-fusion-2-vs-parallels-desktop-4-lets-dance/">a head-to-head comparison</a> of the new Parallels vs. Fusion 2.</p>
<p><em>Personally, I&#8217;ve been happy with VMWare Fusion 2&#8230;is it worth taking a look at Parallels 4?</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Among the providers of online hosted applications that appeal to web workers, I don&#8217;t know of any players who provide quite as diversified sets of tools as Google and Zoho. As noted at <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/11/11/zoho-status/">Mashable</a>, Zoho has now launched a new service called <a href="http://status.zoho.com/">Zoho Status</a>, designed to show uptime and performance metrics for all of Zoho&#8217;s individual applications.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3022643271_78247aea9a_o.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="203" /></p>
<p>The metrics Zoho provides are quite detailed. After taking a look, I&#8217;d say that all applications hosted online could benefit from this level of kimono-opening.</p>
<p>The main Zoho Status page displays an aerial view of response times and downtime details for Zoho&#8217;s portfolio of online applications. On an average day, the downtime report won&#8217;t be of much use, but if you do find an application down, it&#8217;s nice to be able to see whether you&#8217;re the problem or Zoho is.</p>
<p>The response time metrics are very useful, and by clicking on the &#8220;More&#8221; links to the right of each listed application, you can drill down. The reports show the response times for various locations around the globe, from Seattle to Singapore to Australia. I also like the graphs showing response time history over the past several hours. This can give you a sense of when a web application that you may use frequently will perform the best.</p>
<p>Zoho doesn&#8217;t do the underlying monitoring itself, but relies on metrics tracked by <a href="http://site24x7.com/index.html">Site24&#215;7.com</a>. As I mentioned in <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/17/which-is-the-fastest-next-gen-browser-and-why-this-matters/">a previous post</a>, Advent/Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu says that JavaScript performance boosts in the Firefox 3.1 and Google Chrome browsers are poised to have a profound impact on performance for applications such as Zoho&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As these new browsers speed hosted applications up, Vembu says they may even lead to more types of new features in online applications. These types of improvements, along with the new Zoho application metrics, will allow people using hosted applications to get a real feel for the performance they&#8217;re getting. That&#8217;s a good thing for web workers, and the level of disclosure Zoho is providing is a model that all online application providers should follow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Guru_Mindmap.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="203" />Though my Dad is a clever chap - an old school <a href="http://makezine.com/">Maker</a> -  he never had the chance at a higher education and as a consequence would force me to watch historical and educational shows as a kid. One of these were the televised lectures of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono">Edward de Bono</a>, where I first heard learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind maps</a> and what are now commonly considered as &#8216;mind hacks.&#8217;</p>
<p>Mind mapping tools inhabit a curious boundary between tools that need to be as fluid and unstructured as doodling with a pencil and those that can harness the structural and processing power of computers to enhance the creative and mental processses.</p>
<p>Mind mapping tools range from the GTD-like methodologies of the <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/institute/about.htm">Compendium Institute</a>, to the opensource <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"><em>FreeMind</em></a> and lightweight knowledge management such as <em><a href="http://www.deepamehta.de/">DeepMehta</a></em>; incidentally mind-mapping guru <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Russell">Peter Russell</a> has created a <a href="http://www.peterrussell.com/MindMaps/MMSoft.php">useful roundup of tools</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MindJet&#8217;s MindManager 8</strong><br />
One of the more prominent companies in the space is <a href="https://www.mindjet.com/">MindJet</a>, who today released the latest edition of their flagship tool, <em><a href="https://www.mindjet.com/products/mindmanager_pro/default.aspx">MindManager 8</a></em>. With the new release, the company is seeking to integrate mind mapping into user&#8217;s existing workflows and help create mechanisms for collaboration.</p>
<p><a href="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/mindjet.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4919 alignright" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="mindjet" src="http://webworkerdaily.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/mindjet.png?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="mindjet" width="300" height="199" /></a>Though MindManager has been oriented around a desktop experience, the new edition blurs the line between <em>MindManager Web</em> (an entirely web-based edition of the application - pictured) and its desktop counterparts by including integrated web searches, and online database queries from within the desktop app.</p>
<p>For web workers, the web edition&#8217;s most useful feature appears to be the ability to invite other users to view and/or collaborate on a mind-map or project workspace.</p>
<p><strong>Free Trial</strong></p>
<p>MindJet has kindly provided Web Worker Daily with a couple hundred 1-year subscriptions to MindManager Web (not Mind Manager 8!), worth around $120 each. <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/campaign/click.aspx?campID=91">Hop over to this page</a> to sign up and take advantage of this offer.</p>
<p>The link will take you to the new trial page for MindManager Web. Users who click on the link will be taken to a signup page for a free trial.  The first 200 registrations will be converted from free 30-day trials to free 1-year subscriptions; subsequent users will still be able to sign up for free trials, but limited to 30-days.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Many web workers avoid the cost of Microsoft Office productivity applications by using alternatives, including hosted applications online such as Google Docs and Zoho&#8217;s applications. Even if you&#8217;ve already settled on some Office alternatives for core productivity applications such as word processing and spreadsheets, though, it&#8217;s worth looking at some of the free applications found in open source productivity suites.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/3020484808_bb4b0a25bb_o.jpg" alt="" width="61" height="57" /></p>
<p>Even if you only favor some of the adjunct applications in them, they may complement your main applications very well.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/09/19/openoffice-version-3-available-in-a-test-version/">written about</a> the OpenOffice.org open source productivity suite before, which is out in a new version 3.0. It&#8217;s not perfect, and not perfectly compatible with Microsoft Office, but has its attractions. If you&#8217;ve avoided trying it because you already have core productivity applications such as a word processor and a database that you favor, you may still want to look into the other free applications that come with the suite.</p>
<p>Draw is a Microsoft Visio-like diagram drawing application in OpenOffice, Math is a tool for creating and working with mathematical formulas, and Impress is for building presentations. You can launch any or all of these applications on their own, and you may find they complement your core applications.</p>
<p>Today on the OStatic blog, <a href="http://ostatic.com/176859-blog/go-oo-a-lighter-faster-openoffice-with-extras">we covered</a> a fork of OpenOffice called <a href="http://go-oo.org/">Go-oo</a>, which is for Windows and Linux. It&#8217;s a lighter, faster version of the suite, but has the same programs. There are also some attractions to the Go-oo versions that are not found in OpenOffice.</p>
<p>For example, the Calc spreadsheet in Go-oo supports VBA macros very smoothly, so you may find that an Excel spreadsheet macro that chokes in OpenOffice will run smoothly with Go-oo. Go-oo also has under-the-hood extras such as improved support for Microsoft binary files. The best way to get a feel for its compatibility with Microsoft Office files is to simply import a number of them. The biggest benefit to Go-oo over OpenOffice, though, is speed, especially at loading applications.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mistake to assume that the attraction of a software suite is necessarily the whole suite&#8211;the sum of all the parts. For diagrams, math, compatibility with Excel, and more reasons, some of the parts in these open source suites may benefit you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><a href="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/twitter.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="Twitter" src="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/twitter.jpg?w=300" alt="Twitter" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>It is no secret that I love <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I have to admit that besides email, Twitter is my most important communications tool, particularly for my business but not exclusively so. The more I see where social media and online communications is going, the more I realize how Twitter has transformed the landscape in both big and subtle ways.</p>
<p>An obvious example of Twitter&#8217;s impact is how it is quickly becoming part of our lexicon. Even mainstream media is referring to the Twitterstream, using Twitter to gauge public sentiment, and referring to people&#8217;s Twitter pages. Twitter has moved beyond being the news and is now helping to source news for many reporters.</p>
<p>Here are some other ways Twitter has had game-changing impact:</p>
<p><strong>1. Reinvented the threaded messaging board</strong></p>
<p>If you think back to the old online forums before and after threaded messaging and then look at your Twitter page, look familiar? Twitter is loosely threaded messages that are a dynamic blend of conversation with direct references to others in the discussion and broadcasting where the message or the link is the focus.</p>
<p>From watching some of my clients trying to grasp the concept and flow of Twitter, it is clear that this communications display is atypical and can be challenging to follow. Learning to dive into a Twitterstream and come out with a cohesive dialogue or valuable information takes time. For the uninitiated, a threaded message board makes far more sense, however, once you get the hang of the fabric of tweets, you learn to follow the threads, jump to people&#8217;s Twitter pages to catch up with the conversation, and you hone your skills of zeroing in on certain Twitterers to pick out nuggets of useful information. Twitter has changed the flow of conversation and information.</p>
<p><a href="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/jaiku-your-conversation.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-396 alignleft" title="jaiku-your-conversation" src="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/jaiku-your-conversation.jpg?w=300&#038;h=198" alt="Jaiku" width="300" height="198" align="left" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Spawning imitators</strong></p>
<p>First there was <a href="http://www.jaiku.com" target="_blank">Jaiku</a> and <a href="http://www.pownce.com/" target="_blank">Pownce</a>, then <a href="http://www.plurk.com/" target="_blank">Plurk</a> and <a href="http://www.kwippy.com/" target="_blank">Kwippy</a>, all jumping on the microblogging bandwagon, each trying to differentiate themselves from Twitter yet mostly feeling like Twitter knockoffs. Even in their attempt to stand out, they stacked on features or capabilities meant to make them &#8220;more robust&#8221; than Twitter but ended up diluting the purity of Twitter&#8217;s simplicity. Some users, however, preferred the extra bells and whistles of the imitators as well as the stability of some of those other services.</p>
<p>Next came the Twitteresque sites that used the Twitter conversation starter model but focused on specific topics such as <a href="http://www.blippr.com/" target="_blank">blippr</a> where you microblog reviews of arts and entertainment or <a href="http://www.reportingon.com/" target="_blank">Reporting On</a> where journalists simply announce what they are reporting on at any given time. Twitter&#8217;s micro messaging has become a main feature of many new sites and applications.</p>
<p><strong>3. Becoming an add-on for other tools</strong></p>
<p>As I began reviewing project management tools for WWD, I was taken by <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/07/03/joint-contact-inserts-social-media-into-web-based-project-management/" target="_blank">Joint Contact&#8217;s integration of Twitter</a> into their featureset. Suddenly, Twitter was a feature add-on for applications where communications was key i.e. project management. Email, message boards and the usual communications tools were no longer enough. Other project management tools have promised Twitter integration in future iterations. Scott Blitstein also wrote about <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/10/twitter-with-your-favorite-productivity-web-apps/#more-4228" target="_blank">Twitter integration with your favorite productivity apps</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/presently-the-constant-awareness-communication-tool-private-microblogging-for-your-business.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-397 alignright" title="presently-the-constant-awareness-communication-tool-private-microblogging-for-your-business" src="http://alizasherman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/presently-the-constant-awareness-communication-tool-private-microblogging-for-your-business.jpg?w=300&#038;h=185" alt="Present.ly" width="300" height="185" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Transforming internal company communications</strong></p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not in need of enterprise level communications tools, I haven&#8217;t actually tried these out, however, there are now Twittereque apps for the <strong>enterprise</strong> such as <a href="http://www.yammer.com/" target="_blank">Yammer</a> and <a href="http://www.present.ly" target="_blank">present.ly</a>. Mike Gunderloy <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/11/03/enterprise-microsharing-the-next-wave/" target="_blank">blogged about this new trend</a> and referenced <a href="http://pistachioconsulting.com/enterprise-microsharing-apps-read-all-about-em/" target="_blank">a presentation by my Twitterfriend @Pistachio</a> at Pistachio Consulting.</p>
<p><strong>5. Forcing us to do more with less</strong></p>
<p>When I make presentations about Twitter, a common question is &#8220;why are the posts so short?&#8221; Why 140 characters or less? M-marketing and M-comm, I tell them. Twitter laid the groundwork for mainstreaming very short and concise messaging in preparation of communicating efficiently on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Maybe the vision of Twitter wasn&#8217;t necessarily to prep us so we could properly conduct M-marketing tactics over time, however, we are all gaining the skill of reducing our thoughts into tight, taut messages that read easily over our handheld devices.</p>
<p><strong>6. Affecting the way we blog</strong></p>
<p>Almost weekly, a popular blogger announces that he or she is no longer going to blog or no longer going to blog as frequently because of Twitter. Or that Twitter has changed the way they blog or the way they feel about blogging. For better or for worse, Twittering makes blogging feel like a bog both for the blogger and the reader once they are used to swimming in the free flowing Twitterstream.</p>

<p><strong>7. Influencing our communications style</strong></p>
<p>The Twitter Effect on how we communicate is going to be even more obvious than how email communications has forever changed the way we write. I&#8217;ve heard people say that they find themselves speaking in Tweets - short, clipped phrases where they say as much as they can in fewer words. They don&#8217;t do it on purpose, it is just how their mind works now that they&#8217;ve been Twittering for a long period of time. Twitter has created new verbs for us. We now have &#8220;Twitterfriends.&#8221; We &#8220;tweet&#8221; instead of post. When we talk about referencing others in our tweets we are &#8220;atting them&#8221; or &#8220;@ing&#8221; them. When you want someone to contact you, you can just tweet a message asking them to &#8220;@&#8221; you or &#8220;DM&#8221; you (for direct message). To gain Twitter skills means that you have to deliberately let go of old communication styles and rewire your brain to accommodate the new ones required to immerse yourself productively in the Twitterstream.</p>
<p><strong>8. Ever-expanding uses</strong></p>
<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t just a place where you tell the world what you are doing. Its uses have expanded beyond a broadcast tool to a listening device and filter of information. It is also a marketing tool; a market research tool; a customer outreach and customer service tool; and instant focus group; a tech troubleshooting resource; and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>In Twitter&#8217;s undiluted simplicity, it has the uncanny feature of being several things to each person and several new things as people&#8217;s imaginations take hold after a few weeks of Twittering. We have yet to see all of the possibilities of Twittering for our personal lives and for our careers and businesses. We are just scratching the surface.</p>
<p><em>How have you used or seen Twitter used in new and different ways, particularly for business?</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p><a title="View 'Deadline' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8304862@N03/3018487215"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/3018487215_88bf2b56d4_t.jpg" border="0" alt="Deadline" width="100" height="47" align="right" /></a>There&#8217;s a new application in town for those who want a simple approach to maintaining their appointments: <strong><a href="http://deadlineapp.com/">Deadline</a></strong>. They boast of being &#8220;the simplest calendar ever made,&#8221; though a variety of features are already in place or being planned.</p>
<p>After signing up for a free account, you&#8217;ll get a web interface with a box to type. Put in something like &#8220;Feed the cat next week&#8221; and it will strip off the &#8220;next week&#8221; part, parse it to get the date, and make the rest the text of your reminder. Then it adds it to the rest of your reminders on the web page. A search box lets you find reminders with particular text, and brighter white is used to highlight the more immediate tasks.</p>
<p>Other features of Deadline include reminders via email or Jabber-based IM, the ability to set reminders by sending email to a personalized Deadline address, and a mobile user interface. For the future, they&#8217;re planning an iPhone application, customization, and an API, among other things.</p>
<p>I found Deadline easy to use, though its parsing of English was less full-featured than I&#8217;d like (&#8221;in a year&#8221;, for example, seems to be giving the wrong results). It&#8217;ll pop up a box for direct date entry if it doesn&#8217;t see any date at all in your entry. Overall, Deadline has less functionality than the most similar service I know, <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/">I Want Sandy</a>, but Deadline&#8217;s user interface is easier to navigate if you just want to track dates.</p>
