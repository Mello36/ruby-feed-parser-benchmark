		<description>Keith, Thanks for the great pluggin!

"Is it possible to display the graphs in an article on the frontside in the blog?.... "

Actually, I came to ask the same thing. My family is using this to track ourselves &#38; encourage each other (there's about 7 or 8 so far, maybe more later), and it'd be GREAT for us to see each others charts (or just the amount they lost since starting). I would even be willing to help develop it if it's not too hard.</description>

		<description>there should be no issues with running it locally.

your browser is probably disabling javascript for localhost.  make sure it is enabled.</description>

		<description>Do you know of a reason maybe it wouldn't work on a local installation?

I have Wordpress installed on my personal computer (with apache and php) and I put in the Hacker's Diet as well. All the pages load, but when I click on a date to add in the weight, it doesn't turn into a text bar. 

Sorry if this was brought up sometime earlier. I haven't found any comments relating to it. I've always been very bad at searching terms, though.</description>
